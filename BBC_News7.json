[{"author":"Unknown","title":"George Floyd death: Five key moments from the Derek Chauvin trial - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-56802198","content":"The death of George Floyd, a 48-year-old black man, while he was being restrained by a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, during an arrest in Minneapolis in May 2020, shocked the world and sparked global protests about racism and police brutality.Mr Chauvin's three-week trial, on charges of murder and manslaughter, has heard from 45 witnesses and seen hours of video footage filmed by bystanders.As prosecutors and defence lawyers put forward their closing arguments, we look back at five key elements of the trial:1. Impact of arrest on witnessesSome of the most powerful testimony came in the first days of the trial when witnesses spoke of what they saw that day.Darnella, who was 17 at the time of Mr Floyd's death, filmed the video that went viral around the world. She told the jury there were nights when she stayed up \\\"apologising to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life\\\".\\\"When I look at George Floyd, I look at my dad. I look at my brothers, I look at my cousins, my uncles. Because they are all black,\\\" she said.Emotional testimony also came from Charles McMillian, 61, who had been among the first on the scene and had tried to persuade Mr Floyd to get in the police car.He broke down in tears watching graphic footage of the arrest in court, saying he had felt \\\"helpless\\\" as events unfolded and explained that he had confronted Mr Chauvin after Mr Floyd was taking away in an ambulance because \\\"what I watched was wrong\\\".The defence has argued that the presence of bystanders influenced Mr Chauvin's actions that day. The court heard from one Minneapolis police officer, Peter Chang, that the crowd had been \\\"very aggressive to the officers\\\", while Nicole McKenzie, who trains the city's police on providing medical care, said the presence of bystanders at an arrest could make it harder for officers to see signs of distress in those they detained.2. Emotional testimony from girlfriendAnother powerful moment came when Mr Floyd's girlfriend of three years, Courteney Ross, took the stand.She described their first meeting, in the lobby of a Salvation Army homeless shelter, where Mr Floyd worked as a security guard, and how he had been devastated by his mother's death in 2018.Ms Ross also told the court they both suffered from chronic pain, which led to an off-and-on struggle with opioid addiction.\\\"We got addicted and tried really hard to break that addiction many times,\\\" she testified.One of the defence's arguments has been that Mr Floyd died largely because of complications from the opioids and methamphetamine he had in his system at the time of his arrest.3. Was force justified?Another key issue at the heart of this trial has been whether Derek Chauvin violated policies on restraint when he kneeled on George Floyd's neck for nine and a half minutes.The head of Minneapolis police, Chief Medaria Arradondo, was one of the prosecution's most high-profile witnesses and had fired Mr Chauvin a day after the arrest.He told the court that the police officer should have stopped applying \\\"that level of force\\\" the moment Mr Floyd stopped resisting. \\\"It's not part of our training and it's certainly not part of our ethics or values\\\" to continue with such force, he said.Defence witness Barry Brodd, a use-of-force expert, said Mr Chauvin had been \\\"justified\\\" and acted \\\"with objective reasonableness\\\" because of the \\\"imminent threat\\\" Mr Floyd posed in resisting arrest.However, he did concede under cross-examination that the dangers of positional asphyxia - not being able to breathe in a certain position - were well-known among law enforcers.4. Cause of deathThe cause of Mr Floyd's death was arguably central to this trial, with the prosecution maintaining he died from asphyxia while the defence pointed to Mr Floyd's drug use and general poor health.Dr Martin Tobin, an expert in pulmonary medicine, used video footage to explain what was happening to Mr Floyd's breathing during the nine and a half minutes he lay under Mr Chauvin's knee.Even \\\"a healthy person, subjected to what Mr Floyd was subjected to, would have died,\\\" he said.A key witness for the defence, forensic pathologist David Fowler, said Mr Floyd's death should have been classified as \\\"undetermined\\\" rather than as a homicide, because there were \\\"so many conflicting different potential mechanisms\\\".Complicating factors included Mr Floyd's drug use and possible exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning from the police car's exhaust, said Dr Fowler, who was chief medical examiner for the state of Maryland until his retirement in 2019.However, under cross-examination he agreed that Mr Floyd should have been given immediate medical attention when he went into cardiac arrest, as there still was a chance to save his life.5. Taking the Fifth AmendmentJust before the defence rested its case, the man on trial - Derek Chauvin - confirmed to the judge that he would not testify.\\\"I will invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege today,\\\" he said, referring to the constitutional right to remain silent in fear of self-incrimination.Asked by the judge whether this was his decision alone, and whether anyone else had unfairly influenced his decision, Mr Chauvin responded: \\\"No promises or threats, your honour.\\\"Mr Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree unintentional murder - for which he could be jailed for up to 40 years - third-degree murder, and manslaughter.A conviction on any of the counts will require the jury to return a unanimous verdict."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Derek Chauvin trial: What we learnt and key questions answered - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-56776211","content":"The trial of Derek Chauvin, the former US police officer accused of killing George Floyd last year, will soon come to a close.The case has attracted huge global attention and after three weeks of witness and expert testimony, the jury will meet to decide the outcome on Monday.Here we explain what's happened so far, and BBC correspondent Tara McKelvey - who has been in Minneapolis throughout the trial - answers questions from BBC audiences about the case that led to protests around the world.What we have learnt so far in the Chauvin trialA reminder of the background to the case; white police officer Derek Chauvin, now 45, is on trial in Minneapolis after the death of George Floyd in May last year.During Mr Floyd's arrest on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 note at a food store, Mr Chauvin knelt on his neck in the street for more than nine minutes. After repeating \\\"I can't breathe\\\" more than 20 times, Mr Floyd, who was 46, died.Video recorded by eyewitnesses sparked global protests over racial injustice and violent policing.Mr Chauvin was later charged with third-degree murder, second-degree murder and manslaughter.A jury of 12 people, who have been hearing arguments since 29 March, must decide if Mr Chauvin will face time in jail or be acquitted.Prosecution lawyers have claimed that Mr Chauvin used excessive and deadly force without justification. They say that Mr Floyd died from being subdued and not from drug use or ill health, as the defence has argued.The top homicide investigator in Minneapolis testified that Mr Chauvin used \\\"totally unnecessary\\\" force.The defence argued that Mr Chauvin's use of force against Mr Floyd was justified because he faced an \\\"imminent threat\\\" from the suspect.Experts called by Mr Chauvin's legal team said the former officer's behaviour did not deviate from Minneapolis police department policy and law enforcement standards.On Thursday, Mr Chauvin declined to give testimony, citing his constitutional right to remain silent.What are the differences between the three charges Chauvin faces?Readers have asked about what Mr Chauvin is charged with and what the prosecution have to prove in each case.BBC correspondent Tara McKelvey explains the three charges of manslaughter, second-degree murder and third-degree murder.Manslaughter is when someone unintentionally causes another person's death.In second-degree murder, the act that led to someone's death could have been intentional or unintentional. The maximum sentence is 40 years in prison.Third-degree murder means an individual has acted in a way that endangered one or more people, ending in death. This charge was added later and experts say it is easier to prove in court, but the jail sentence would be lower.Police officers have rarely been convicted - if they are charged at all - for deaths that occur in custody, and the verdict in this trial is being widely seen as an indication of how the US legal system will treat such cases in future.Are the jurors sequestered?Yes, from Monday, explains Tara McKelvey. Being sequestered means they will be isolated from contact with the outside world, including TV and other media.The jurors will arrive at the courthouse on Monday morning, with suitcases packed.The lawyers from the defence team and the prosecution will make their closing arguments, summarising key points of their case, and then the judge will explain to the jury important legal aspects they should consider.Then, the jurors will be taken to a hotel, where they will remain during their deliberations.A lawyer arguing for Mr Chauvin asked the judge to sequester the jury earlier in the trial following the high-profile shooting by a police officer in Minneapolis of 20-year-old black man Daunte Wright. The judge denied the request.What happens if the jury don't return a unanimous decision?Several readers asked if the charges would be dropped if the 12 jury members fail to reach a unanimous decision.All the jurors have to agree in order to reach a verdict, explains Tara McKelvey. If they do not, there will be a \\\"hung jury\\\", which means the jurors were unable to reach a conclusion.At that point, the judge could declare a mistrial. A second trial would then have to take place, and the process would start again.Why aren't the other officers involved being prosecuted for not intervening?The other former officers, Tou Thao, Thomas Lane, and J Alexander Kueng, who were with Mr Chauvin during Mr Floyd's arrest, have been charged with aiding and abetting.They are due to face trial in August.What were the qualifications of the defence witnesses?Several readers asked questions about the debate over whether the field of forensic science has a racial bias. It comes after the Journal of Forensic Sciences published a study which showed that medically irrelevant information like the victim's race can sway the decisions of forensic pathologists.During the trial, medical experts testified about Mr Floyd's cause of death, including forensic pathologist David Fowler, who was a witness for the defence.Mr Fowler was formerly a chief medical examiner in the US state of Maryland. He has also taught classes at the University of Maryland School of Medicine as an adjunct associate professor.His work for the state of Maryland was controversial, and the American Civil Liberties Union has criticised his tenure, stating that his office was \\\"complicit in creating false narratives about what kills black people in police encounters\\\"."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Derek Chauvin: The man accused of killing George Floyd - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-56352259","content":"Derek Chauvin, the former police officer filmed kneeling on George Floyd's neck before he died, is on trial in Minneapolis.Since Mr Floyd's arrest and death on 25 May, the 19-year police veteran has remained largely out of the spotlight and free on bail.Mr Chauvin will be the first of the four officers involved in the incident to stand trial. Jury selection began on 9 March.He is facing the most serious charges of the four, including second-degree murder. Mr Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to the charges.The others are charged with aiding and abetting Mr Chauvin's alleged crimes.What charges does Chauvin face?He is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter. Prosecutors are also seeking to add a charge of third-degree murder.Legal experts say that third-degree murder carries a lesser sentence, but it is easier to prove in court.To prove second-degree murder, prosecutors must convince jurors that a serious assault had been committed by Mr Chauvin, and that it was a \\\"substantial causal factor\\\" in Mr Floyd's death.Third-degree murder requires prosecutors to prove that Mr Chauvin showed a reckless disregard for human life, but not prove that an assault led to the death.In an unrelated case filed after Mr Floyd's death, prosecutors charged Mr Chauvin and his wife with underpaying taxes for six years. They have pleaded not guilty to nine charges against them. Each charge carries a sentence of five years in prison.What is Chauvin's police record?Mr Chauvin, 44, was the most senior officer involved in Mr Floyd's arrest, having served for almost two decades with the Minneapolis Police Department.His record of policing included both commendations and complaints about conduct.In 2006, Mr Chauvin was recommended for a medal of valour for his role in the shooting of a man who aimed a shotgun at officers.There have been at least 15 conduct complaints against him, the Star Tribune reported, citing records from the Minneapolis Police Department's Internal Affairs. Most of the complaints were closed without discipline.Mr Chauvin's personal files were heavily redacted, but there are details of one complaint from 2007.It concerns allegations Mr Chauvin pulled a woman from her car and frisked her after she was caught driving 10mph (16 km\\\/h) over the speed limit.A report found Mr Chauvin did not record audio of the incident and failed to switch his dashboard camera on during the stop.He was disciplined for this complaint and one other, receiving a letter of reprimand on both occasions, records show.What do we know about his personal life?Mr Chauvin served two stints in the US Army prior to his career with the police. He was a member of the military police from September 1996 to February 1997, and again from September 1999 to May 2000.His other previous jobs include security guard and McDonald's employee.The day after Mr Chauvin's arrest, a lawyer for his wife Kellie said she had filed for divorce.\\\"She is devastated by Mr Floyd's death and her utmost sympathy lies with his family, with his loved ones and with everyone who is grieving this tragedy,\\\" her lawyer said in a statement.Did Chauvin know George Floyd?After Mr Floyd's death, the owner of a nightclub in Minneapolis revealed that the two men had worked alongside each other every Tuesday night.Maya Santamaria, the owner of El Nuevo Rodeo said Mr Floyd worked security inside the club, while Mr Chauvin was paid while off duty to sit inside his squad car outside the club and occasionally help remove unruly patrons.\\\"I wouldn't characterise them as knowing each other,\\\" she told CNN, adding that \\\"they would have crossed paths\\\".Lawyers for Mr Floyd's family had argued that Mr Chauvin's alleged past relationship with Mr Floyd played a role in his death.An employee at the club initially claimed that the two men regularly \\\"butted heads\\\", but later said he had mistaken Mr Floyd for another black worker.What has happened since Chauvin's arrest?On 7 October 2020, a judge agreed to free Mr Chauvin on a $1m (£718m) bail, pending trial. He had been held since May at a maximum-security prison in Oak Park Heights, Minnesota.Conditions of his bail include Mr Chauvin not contacting Mr Floyd's family, surrendering his firearms and not working in law enforcement or security as he awaits trial.In February, US media reported that former US Attorney General Bill Barr quashed a potential plea deal that would have seen Mr Chauvin spend 10 years behind bars in exchange for pleading guilty.The New York Times reported that Mr Barr, a Trump appointee, felt the deal was would be perceived as too lenient, and wanted state officials to be make their own decisions regarding Mr Chauvin's prosecution.What happened to George Floyd?The 46-year-old was arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill.He was handcuffed, but when officers tried to put him into the squad car he resisted and a struggle ended with Mr Floyd face down on the street.Mr Chauvin, 44, kneeled on Mr Floyd's back and neck for more than nine minutes, according to prosecutors. Three other officers assisted Mr Chauvin.Mr Floyd said he could not breathe more than 20 times. The video shows him go limp and get carried away by police.He was pronounced dead in hospital an hour later."},{"author":"By Jonathan Amos","title":"Nasa successfully flies small helicopter on Mars - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-56799755","content":"The American space agency has successfully flown a small helicopter on Mars.The drone, called Ingenuity, was airborne for less than a minute, but Nasa is celebrating what represents the first powered, controlled flight by an aircraft on another world.Confirmation came via a satellite at Mars which relayed the chopper's data back to Earth.The space agency is promising more adventurous flights in the days ahead.Ingenuity will be commanded to fly higher and further as engineers seek to test the limits of the technology.The rotorcraft was carried to Mars in the belly of Nasa's Perseverance Rover, which touched down in Jezero Crater on the Red Planet in February.\\\"We can now say that human beings have flown a rotorcraft on another planet,\\\" said a delighted MiMi Aung, project manager for Ingenuity at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California.\\\"We've been talking for so long about our 'Wright Brothers moment' on Mars, and here it is.\\\"This is a reference to Wilbur and Orville Wright who conducted the first powered, controlled aircraft flight here on Earth in 1903.Ingenuity even carries a small swatch of fabric from one of the wings of Flyer 1, the aircraft that made that historic flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, more than 117 years ago.There were cheers in the JPL control centre as the first photos of the flight arrived back on Earth. In the background, MiMi Aung could be heard saying: \\\"It's real!\\\"To claps from her colleagues, she tore up the contingency speech to have been used in the event of failure.The demonstration saw the Mars-copter rise to about 3m, hover, swivel and then set down. In all, it managed almost 40 seconds of flight, from take-off to landing.Getting airborne on the Red Planet is not easy. The atmosphere is very thin, just 1% of the density here at Earth. This gives the blades on a rotorcraft very little to bite into to gain lift.There's help from the lower gravity at Mars, but still - it takes a lot of work to get up off the ground.Ingenuity was therefore made extremely light and given the power (a peak power of 350 watts) to turn those blades extremely fast - at over 2,500 revolutions per minute for this particular flight.Control was autonomous. The distance to Mars - currently just under 300 million km - means radio signals take minutes to traverse the intervening space. Flying by joystick is simply out of the question.Asked whether she was surprised the flight had worked, MiMi Aung said: \\\"No, I'm not. We really had nailed the equations, the models and the verification here on Earth in our laboratory tests. So, it then became a question of: have we chosen the right materials to build Ingenuity, to survive the space environment, to survive the Mars environment?\\\"We've gone from 'theory says you can' to really now having done it. It's a major first for the human race,\\\" she told BBC News.Ingenuity has two cameras onboard. A black-and-white camera that points down to the ground, which is used for navigation, and a high-resolution colour camera that looks out to the horizon.Sample navigation images sent back to Earth revealed the helicopter's shadow on the floor of the crater as it came back in to land. Satellites will send home more pictures of the flight over the next day. There was only sufficient bandwidth in the orbiters' first overflight to return a short snatch of video from Perseverance, which was watching and snapping away from a distance of 65m. Longer sequences should become available in due course.Nasa has announced that the \\\"airstrip\\\" in Jezero where Perseverance dropped off Ingenuity for its demonstration will henceforth be known as the \\\"Wright Brothers Field\\\".The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) - the United Nations' civil aviation agency - has also presented the Nasa and the US Federal Aviation Administration with an official ICAO designator: IGY, call-sign INGENUITY.A successful maiden outing means that a further four flights will be attempted over the coming days, each one taking the helicopter further afield.The hope is this initial demonstration could eventually transform how we explore some distant worlds.Drones might be used to scout ahead for future rovers, and even astronauts once they eventually get to Mars.\\\"It's really taking a tool that we haven't been able to use before and putting it in the box of tools that is available for all of our missions going forward at Mars. So for me, it's really exciting personally and for the community overall it opens up new doors,\\\" said Dr Thomas Zurbuchen, the head of science at Nasa.\\\"We will be able to explore areas where we cannot use a rover. Some of these crater walls, for example, are so exciting; scientists have been writing papers about them.\\\"Nasa has already approved a helicopter mission to Titan, the big moon of Saturn. Dragonfly, as the mission is known, should arrive at Titan in the mid-2030s."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"European Super League: Ministers will do 'whatever it takes' to block breakaway - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-politics-56807515","content":"The government has said it will do \\\"whatever it takes\\\" to prevent a breakaway European Super League involving six English clubs.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said he was joining the \\\"roars of outrage\\\" over the move.The Duke of Cambridge also said he shared fans' concerns about \\\"the damage it risks causing to the game we love\\\".The 12 founding members of the league - plus three yet to join - would be permanent and never face relegation.The competition would have 20 teams and the other five sides would have to qualify each year for the competition, to take place midweek and rival the Champions League.Fans and pundits have expressed revulsion at what they claim would be an unfair competition, locking others out of top European football.Around 68% of football fans strongly oppose the creation of the European Super League (ESL), while only 14% support it, according to a YouGov survey of 1,730 fans.About 200 football supporters gathered outside Leeds United's Elland Road ground ahead of the club's Premier League game against Liverpool to protest against the proposed new league.Prince William, who is the current president of the Football Association, said in a tweet: \\\"Now, more than ever, we must protect the entire football community - from the top level to the grassroots - and the values of competition and fairness at its core.\\\"Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham have signed up to the plan.They would join Spanish sides Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona and Italian clubs AC Milan, Juventus and Inter Milan.In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Dowden criticised the so-called \\\"big six\\\" English clubs for going \\\"against the very spirit of the game\\\".He added that owners \\\"should remember that they are only temporary custodians of these clubs and that they forget fans at their peril\\\".A fan-led review, due to take place after the pandemic, has been brought forward because of the ESL announcement, Mr Dowden said.It would be led by former sports minister Tracey Crouch and \\\"consider how fans can have an even greater say in the oversight of the game and models which might best achieve that\\\", he added.The review also look at the finances of the men's and women's game, its governance and whether an independent football regulator should be set up.Mr Dowden said he had spoken to Uefa and the Football Association, who both oppose the move by the 12 clubs, adding that, \\\"if they can't act, we will\\\".\\\"We will put everything on the table to prevent this from happening,\\\" he told MPs. \\\"We are examining every option from governance reform to competition law and mechanisms that allow football to take place.\\\"We will be reviewing everything Government does to support these clubs to play.

Of these, the 12 founding members - plus three yet to join - would be permanent and never face relegation.Five other sides would qualify each year.The new league would rival the current Champions League competition, one of the biggest club tournaments in football.Why is the plan widely opposed?The move has been condemned by fans, pundits and by most football bodies not involved.With 15 teams in the ESL not facing qualification or relegation, critics say it will create a closed shop at the top of football.The Premier League says it \\\"attacks the principles of open competition and sporting merit\\\".Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the plans threatened the pyramid structure of English football, \\\"where funds from the globally successful Premier League flow down the leagues and into local communities\\\".There's also the fear that the ESL would draw huge global TV audiences away from existing leagues such as England's Premier League and Italy's Serie A.Why do the teams want a Super League?Money seems to be the driving force.Football club revenues have been hit hard by the Covid pandemic, with disrupted fixtures and a lack of spectators.Big clubs have superstar players with multi-million pound salaries to be paid.The founding clubs are being enticed with a share of a \\u20AC3.5bn (£3bn) grant provided by the investment bank JP Morgan.The ESL argues the new tournament \\\"will provide significantly greater economic growth and support for European football\\\".How would the Super League work?Under the proposals, the ESL would start in August each year, with plans to launch \\\"as soon as practicable\\\".The 20-team league would be split into two groups of 10, playing each other home and away.The top three in each group would qualify for the quarter-finals, with the teams in fourth and fifth playing a two-legged play-off for the two remaining spots.From then on, it would have the same two-leg knockout format used in the Champions League, with a final in May at a neutral venue.What's being done to stop the ESL?Uefa, Europe's football governing body, had hoped plans for a new 36-team Champions League would head off the formation of a Super League.Sports bodies say they will \\\"remain united\\\" in trying to stop the breakaway league, using legal and sporting measures if required.Uefa's president has warned that the clubs would be banned from all other competitions at domestic and international level.He said that players would also be prevented from representing their national teams at the World Cup.Can the government stop English teams joining?Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the government is \\\"going to look at everything that we can do with the football authorities to make sure that this doesn't go ahead in the way that it's currently being proposed\\\".Asked if the government could claw back coronavirus loans to the clubs, a Downing Street spokesman said it was looking at all options.No 10 has also refused to rule out introducing legislation.What happens next?Much could depend on which other teams sign up.Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Paris St Germain - the biggest clubs in Germany and France - have not thrown their lot in with the breakaway league.The world governing body, Fifa, previously said it would not recognise a breakaway European league.Fifa has expressed its \\\"disapproval\\\" and called on \\\"all parties involved in heated discussions to engage in calm, constructive and balanced dialogue for the good of the game\\\".Meanwhile, the ESL is trying to block any sanctions Uefa or Fifa may try to enforce over the formation of the league."},{"author":"By Mark Savage","title":"Man 'stalking' Taylor Swift arrested in New York -

He fell ill in 2006 and two years later he formally handed over the presidency to his brother.Fidel Castro died in 2016 but his brother Raúl maintained the grip of Cuba's Communist Party on power on the island.Who is Miguel Díaz-Canel?Even though Miguel Díaz-Canel was born after the Cuban revolution, he is seen as one of its staunchest defenders and a close ally to the Castros.He began his political career in his early 20s as a member of the Young Communist League in Santa Clara, a city dominated by the mausoleum of Che Guevara, who fought alongside the Castros in the Cuban revolution.He worked his way up through the ranks and became minister of higher education in 2009.In 2013, he became vice-president of the powerful council of state. Five years later, in 2018, he was elected Cuba's president by the country's National Assembly with 99.83% of the vote in a process which was fully overseen by the ruling Communist Party.What are his policies?Under Mr Díaz-Canel's leadership, Cuba has maintained good relations with North Korea, China, Russia, Bolivia and Venezuela.And while he has vowed to protect Cuba's sovereignty and the Castros' ideals, he faces a country mired in its most serious economic crisis in decades.Cuba's economy shrank by 11% last year as the Covid-19 pandemic as well as sanctions and tighter financial restrictions imposed by the US government under former President Donald Trump hit the island hard.Mr Díaz-Canel welcomed the election of President Joe Biden and said that he believed \\\"constructive bilateral relations respecting another's differences\\\" were possible under the new president.In his final address to the Communist Party on Friday, Mr Castro echoes that sentiment, saying that there was a \\\"willingness to conduct a respectful dialogue and build a new kind of relationship with the United States\\\",However, with the White House saying that a shift in its policy towards Cuba was not among President Joe Biden's top foreign policy priorities, any possible changes in the two countries' relationship still appear to be far off."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Australian sex education campaign branded 'concerning' by activists - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-australia-56804864","content":"The Australian government has been criticised for a new education campaign designed to teach schoolchildren about consent and sexual assault.The online programme uses metaphors such as eating tacos and smearing milkshake on someone's face to depict disrespect and abuse.Equality activists have described the videos as \\\"bizarre\\\" and \\\"concerning\\\".The government has defended the campaign, which it said was created with the help of experts.\\\"These materials will provide additional support to better educate young Australians on these issues and have been designed to complement programmes already being offered by states and territories,\\\" Education Minister Alan Tudge said when announcing the campaign last week.The online learning platform, published on The Good Society website, includes more than 350 videos, stories and podcasts. It was developed as part of the Australian government's Respect Matters programme, to teach respectful relationships in schools.One video, designed for students aged between 14 and 17, shows a teenage girl smearing milkshake on her boyfriend's face without his permission. The video then uses other examples of eating pizza and \\\"touching your butt\\\" as situations where permission would be required.Another video about respecting other people's decisions and choices shows a teenage girl doubting whether she wants to swim with sharks, while a boy tries to convince her to do so.A section entitled \\\"sex and gender norms\\\" confuses \\\"norms\\\" and \\\"myths\\\", for example by suggesting that ideas such as \\\"males enjoy sex more than females\\\" and \\\"females that wear short skirts want sex\\\" are examples of gender norms.The Good Society's website describes the learning material as an \\\"engaging, flexible, online program that helps students develop safe, healthy and respectful relationships\\\".But women's rights activists and anti-rape campaigners say the content is harmful, avoids using the words sex, rape or assault and does not reflect realistic situations or relationships.Gender equality organisation Fair Agenda has launched a petition calling on the Australian government to work with violence prevention experts to replace the \\\"concerning and bizarre\\\" content.\\\"Young people deserve consent and respectful relationships training that practically and explicitly helps them understand how to ethically navigate relationships,\\\" it said.Fair Agenda also said the website failed to meet Australia's national standards for the prevention of sexual assault through education. It uses the website's \\\"further information\\\" page as an example, which tells students they can report \\\"any sexual violation\\\" to the Australian Human Rights Commission, but does not recommend telling a trusted adult or the police.Sharna Bremner, the director of the Australian organisation End Rape on Campus, tweeted: \\\"There is some good information on the site. But there's also some really harmful stuff, which outweighs any of the good.\\\"Australian of the Year and sexual assault survivor Grace Tame said the videos were insulting the intelligence of adults and children alike.\\\"It minimises the experience of rape trauma, it fails to really address the nuances of this complex issue of consent,\\\" she told The Drum programme on ABC TV.The material has also been criticised for being out of touch with modern teenagers, by using references to the Hollywood movie Titanic, which was released 24 years ago, and The X-Files TV series, which finished its final season nearly 20 years ago.In a statement on 14 April, Australia's education department said the programme had been developed in \\\"conjunction with Our Watch, the eSafety Commissioner and the Foundation for Young Australians (FYA), as well as parent, community and principals' groups\\\".However, Our Watch and the FYA have said that they were barely consulted. FYA told SBS News it introduced the government to a young person in its network who may have taken part in a confidential reference group in late 2017.Our Watch, which works to prevent violence against women and children, said in a statement that it \\\"was consulted between late 2017 and early 2019 when the materials were being developed and provided advice.

Of those 161 - or 4.8% - tested positive for Covid-19 after a PCR test.The new travel rule applies to England and Scotland. There are currently no direct international flights into Wales or Northern Ireland.Scotland's Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: \\\"International travel will continue to remain a significant risk, requiring a cautious approach, on a four-nation basis.\\\"Mr Hancock said there had also been 557 cases of the South Africa variant found in the UK since December, with a \\\"cluster\\\" of cases in south London and isolated cases in Barnet, Birmingham and Sandwell over the last week.While around two-thirds were related to international travel, there had been a \\\"small amount\\\" of community transmission, he added.He said the government was \\\"ramping up\\\" plans for a booster shot to ensure vaccines stayed \\\"ahead of the virus\\\".It was less than four months ago that India banned flights from the UK to stop the spread of the UK variant.Now, as the so-called 'Indian variant' is investigated, and case numbers there climb, the reverse has happened.It shows how quickly dynamics between countries can change.When the Westminster government last added countries to the red list, including Bangladesh and Pakistan, at the start of April, it gave a week's notice. This time it's just over three days.Direct flights to and from India are already limited - a decision made by the Indian government in January - to 30 a week, meaning that many will now be rushing to book the last few seats before Friday.The travel industry is still hoping that international travel from England will restart on 17 May, but today's announcement underlines that it will be a while until the world is open to us.The list of countries on the banned list is getting longer rather than shorter.Responding to a question from shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, Mr Hancock said that surge Covid testing would happen in areas where cases of the India variant had been identified.Labour's Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee, questioned why India was not put on the red list sooner, adding: \\\"Hong Kong this week have identified 47 Covid cases just on a single Delhi flight and we have still 16 more direct flights, many more indirect flights from India to here, before Friday alone.\\\"Mr Hancock responded by saying that decisions on each country were \\\"kept under constant review\\\".The announcement came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson cancelled a planned trip to India, which had been due to take place on 26 April, amid rising cases there.India has been reporting more than 200,000 cases daily since 15 April. Its capital Delhi has announced a week-long lockdown after a record spike in cases overwhelmed the city's healthcare system.It comes as the UK recorded four deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the latest government figures.It is the lowest daily figure since 7 September, although the number of deaths recorded on Monday and over the weekend tend to be lower because of reporting delays.The data also showed there were also 2,963 new infections. Meanwhile, more than 10m people in the UK received a second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and nearly 33 million people have had their first dose.How does hotel quarantine work?All travellers returning to the UK must fill out a passenger locator form in advance, including details of their departure country and UK address.They must also show proof of a negative Covid test taken within 72 hours before travelling to be allowed entry to the UK.In England, a stay in a quarantine hotel costs £1,750 per passenger travelling alone to cover transport, tests, food and accommodation.Every additional adult, or child over 12, must pay £650, while children aged five to 12 pay £325.Returning travellers must take a Covid test on days two and eight of quarantine, at a cost of £210.A negative test result does not mean they can shorten their time in quarantine, but if they test positive, they must self-isolate for a further 10 days.Neither will they be able to end it early through the Test to Release scheme, where travellers from non-red list countries can leave home isolation after a negative test on day five.Rule-breakers face strict penalties - including prison sentences of up to 10 years.Are you trying to travel to India from the UK?

A more sophisticated version, called \\\"full self-driving\\\" is due to be released later this year.But in fact, neither of these systems offers full self-driving as you or I might understand it.Tesla itself states that the human driver is meant to be fully alert and in control at all times - and has included systems in its cars which are supposed to ensure they keep their hands on the wheel.Yet look on social media, and it isn't hard to find videos of Tesla drivers asleep at the wheel, or even climbing into the back seat. Abuse of the system has been linked with a handful of fatalities.Critics - including the UK car safety research group Thatcham - say the terms Tesla uses to describe what remains a driving assistance system are misleading and encourage this sort of dangerous behaviour.In Germany, the company has already been banned from using the terms \\\"autopilot inclusive\\\" and \\\"full potential for autonomous driving\\\" in its advertising materials.Self-driving carsElon Musk, Tesla\\u2019s chief executive, has previously laid out his vision for \\u201Cfully self-driving\\u201D cars to be made available this year.But last month, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened investigations into 27 crashes involving Tesla vehicles.In a related incident this Monday, a Tesla owner climbed on top of a car at the Shanghai Auto Show to protest that the \\\"brake lost control\\\", Bloomberg reported.A series of fires have also taken place involving the Model S.In 2018, a Tesla car driven by British TV director Michael Morris burst into flames, following another such incident involving a Model S model in France in 2016.Several fires related to Tesla Model S cars took place in 2013."},{"author":"By Mark Savage","title":"Morrissey's manager attacks 'hurtful and racist' Simpsons parody - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/entertainment-arts-56806312","content":"Morrissey appears to have taken offence at The Simpsons after being sent up in the animation's latest episode.In the show, titled Panic On The Streets of Springfield, Lisa Simpson becomes obsessed with the militantly vegan singer of a 1980s indie band.But her dreams are shattered when it transpires her idol, voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, had become a bitter, overweight, anti-immigrant meat-eater.A statement on Morrissey's Facebook called the show \\\"hurtful and racist\\\".\\\"Surprising what a 'turn for the worst' the writing for The Simpson's TV show has taken in recent years,\\\" said the statement, which was posted by the star's manager, Peter Katsis.\\\"Poking fun at subjects is one thing,\\\" it continued, \\\"but when a show stoops so low to use harshly hateful tactics like showing the Morrissey character with his belly hanging out of his shirt (when he has never looked like that at any point in his career) makes you wonder who the real hurtful, racist group is here.\\\"Even worse - calling the Morrissey character out for being a racist, without pointing out any specific instances, offers nothing. It only serves to insult the artist.\\\"The statement went on to accuse The Simpsons of hypocrisy, noting that white actor Hank Azaria had recently bowed to criticism and agreed to stop voicing the Indian character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.\\\"Hank Azaria's recent apology to the whole country of India for his role in upholding 'structural racism' says it all,\\\" the message said.Prior to the episode airing, Morrisey's official Facebook page had promoted the show by posting a still image from the animation.The show said it would not be commenting on the star's latest statement.'Hamburger Is Homicide'However, the episode's writer previously insisted that the character was not solely based on Morrissey.\\\"I'm sticking by that,\\\" Tim Long told Variety magazine, adding: \\\"The character is definitely Morrissey-esque, with maybe a small dash of Robert Smith from the Cure, Ian Curtis from Joy Division, and a bunch of other people\\\".Called Quilloughby, the character was said to be the lead singer of a band called The Snuffs - a stand-in for The Smiths.The episode also featured music by Flight Of The Conchords and The Muppets' songwriter, Bret McKenzie; and included parodies of The Smiths song titles, such as How Late Is Then, Hamburger Is Homicide, and Everyone Is Horrid Except Me (And Possibly You).Long said the episode had been inspired by his love of British indie bands during the 1980s, recalling how seeing The Smiths on their The Queen Is Dead tour had \\\"changed my life\\\".\\\"I've seen Moz [Morrissey] many times since then, most recently at the Hollywood Bowl in 2018,\\\" he explained to Variety.\\\"Executive producer Matt Selman was also at that show, and we got to talking about how much music meant to us as weird, alienated teenagers - and also how being a big fan of someone is like having a lifelong relationship with them, with all the ups and down that implies. This show grew out of that discussion.\\\"In recent years, Morrissey has been criticised for his outspoken and controversial views.He has called halal meat \\\"evil\\\", accused London Mayor Sadiq Khan of being unable to \\\"talk properly\\\" and appeared to defend actor Kevin Spacey over allegations of sexual abuse.The singer has also expressed support for the far-right For Britain party, wearing a badge with its logo on during a US TV performance.He has consistently denied being a racist.Panic On The Streets Of Springfield has yet to be broadcast in the UK, but is expected to premiere on Sky One next month.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

A restaurant was destroyed.The University of Cape Town's historic library was also badly damaged.About 250 firefighters have been battling the blaze, which has been fanned by strong winds.Helicopters were used to water-bomb flames, but their work had been hampered by the conditions.South African National Parks said firefighters were alerted at 09:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Sunday. The flames spread quickly because of the low humidity and dry bush.The fire created its own wind further increasing the rate of spread, it added, estimating that firefighters would need at least three days to control the blaze.The Table Mountain area is prone to fires because of its vegetation, but this is the first time it has engulfed the neighbouring university.City officials said a suspect had been detained amid speculation that new fires may have been started and the original fire was an act of arson.\\\"The fire is not under control yet. At this time, the wind is a major contributing factor,\\\" a statement issued by city officials said.The emergency services have evacuated some residents from the upmarket suburb of Vredehoek, along the slopes of Table Mountain.Schools in the suburb have been also ordered to evacuate.\\\"The fire that initially started in the vicinity of Rhodes Memorial just under 24 hours ago continues to rage and has spread in the direction of Vredehoek,\\\" city officials said in a statement.Disa Park, which refers to three identical residential buildings close to the foot of Table Mountain, has also been evacuated.The nearby University of Cape Town has also been shut and about 4,000 students evacuated.Historic collections destroyedThe fire destroyed the Reading Room at the university's 200-year-old Jagger Library, including a unique collection of African books and archives - many still unexplored.\\\"Some of us watched from on site with horror and helplessness this elegant and historical library burn,\\\" said the university's executive director of libraries, Ujala Satgoor.The African Studies section was also damaged by the blaze.Some 3,500 historic collections were lost, including the Bleek and Lloyd collection of the indigenous San language, university officials said.But fortunately not everything was destroyed.The library's fire doors closed automatically. This prevented the fire from spreading and may have saved more archives held in the basement, including records of the campaign against white minority rule in South Africa.The historic Mostert's Mill was also destroyed. It was built in 1796, and was the oldest surviving windmill in South Africa.Residents in the area have been warned of smoke and soot in the air, and told to keep windows and doors closed.Meanwhile hikers in the Table Mountain National Park have been urged to leave and drivers who have parked in the area have been told to collect their vehicles.All photos subject to copyright"},{"author":"By Daniel De Simone","title":"US neo-Nazi group should be banned in UK, home secretary says - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-56803647","content":"An American neo-Nazi group linked to five murders in the US should be banned in the UK as a terrorist organisation, the government has said.Home Secretary Priti Patel will ask for permission from MPs to outlaw the group called Atomwaffen Division (AWD).Prosecutors have cited AWD as an influence on a number of teenagers in the UK convicted of terror offences.Ms Patel said she was taking action \\\"to protect young and vulnerable people from being radicalised\\\".AWD would be the fourth neo-Nazi group to be banned in the UK, joining National Action, Sonnenkrieg Division and Feuerkrieg Division.A formal ban, which will come into effect this week if the move is approved in Parliament, will make it a terror offence to be a member of the group or invite support for it.The government will list National Socialist Order as a formal alias of AWD, meaning it is assessed to be the same organisation.AWD was founded in 2015 and has since spread to several countries around the world.It is part of a network of groups generated by a now defunct neo-Nazi internet forum called Iron March, which was based in Russia.The British organisation National Action - itself banned in 2016 - emerged from the same space and inspired AWD.The American group, in turn, influenced a series of other organisations, including a British version of AWD called Sonnenkrieg Division, which was exposed by the BBC in 2018 and outlawed in its own right last year.In the US, people linked to AWD have been responsible for five murders, explosives offences, and hate crimes.Prosecutors in several UK terror cases have cited AWD's example as an influence on a number of teenagers, including:Several people linked to the Sonnenkrieg Division have also been jailed.Home Secretary Priti Patel said: \\\"Vile and racist white supremacist groups like this exist to spread hate, sow division and advocate the use of violence to further their sick ideologies.\\\"I will do all I can to protect young and vulnerable people from being radicalised which is why I am taking action to proscribe this dangerous group.\\\"AWD's racist ideology encourages the destabilisation and destruction of society through acts of violence by lone actors or small cells.Adherents believe such activity will accelerate a predicted collapse of civilization and that white ethno-states can be formed in the aftermath.Chief among the group's influences are the veteran ideologue of neo-Nazi terrorism James Mason, the murderous cult leader Charles Manson, and elements of the Satanist organisation Order of Nine Angles.Last year AWD announced it was disbanding, but it then re-emerged under the alias National Socialist Order. The AWD brand continues to be referenced by various right-wing extremistsIt will be the first US addition to the official list of proscribed terror groups. More than 70 international terrorist organisations are currently outlawed, as well as 14 Northern Irish groups.Bans 'not the only solution'The move comes during a period when right-wing extremism has become a major counter terrorism focus in the UK.In the last two years, seven people have been charged with planning terror attacks inspired by right-wing ideologies. In the same period, four people have been charged with preparing Islamist extremist attacks.Dr Cassie Miller, a senior research analyst at US anti-hate organisation the Southern Poverty Law Centre, said the move to proscribe had been made \\\"belatedly\\\" and that bans \\\"can't be our only solution to the problem of right-wing extremism\\\".She added that the group's \\\"central belief - that Western society should be brought to the point of collapse through acts of violence - animates a large part of the white power movement across the US and UK\\\".\\\"Proscribing the group doesn't address the fact that their violent and apocalyptic ideology extends far beyond its small network of members.\\\""},{"author":"Simon Jack","title":"Why Super League plan makes financial sense for top clubs - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56800611","content":"Sports fans love a bit of jeopardy - a nail biting contest which can end in glory or defeat. But business owners generally hate all of that.Owners and business managers of football clubs have a peculiar problem.As one former chief executive of a Premier League club told me - I won't know till the last day of the season if my budget for next year is going to be £170m or £70m.That is not only almost impossible to manage, it has another very important consequence. Businesses with steady revenues are worth a lot more than ones with erratic earnings.In business terms it's known as getting a higher \\\"multiple\\\" - volatile businesses are worth as little as five times average annual earnings, whereas steady ones are worth up to 20 times or more.Giants v minnowsThis is what the European Super League is all about - making the clubs involved worth more by eliminating the jeopardy of being relegated or missing out on Champions League qualification.This is the moment many football team owners have been waiting for - particularly the American owners of Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal - who know for themselves how much more stable and therefore valuable are the earnings of American sports teams.The backers of the Super League say that the existing Champions League was a poor product - too many meaningless one sided games between minnows and giants of European football before it got interesting.They also argue that a more stable financial top to the football pyramid is needed to ensure the cascade or trickle down to the smaller clubs that they promise will increase as a result of this.But many sports fans would argue the prospect of a romantic giant killing in Real Madrid's Bernabeau stadium or Old Trafford is an essential part of the game - while regular meetings between the great clubs normalise and make humdrum what was once an exotic and rare event.The backers have told the BBC this is not another extreme form of negotiation to make Uefa cave to the big clubs' long-standing demands for more control of the world's most prestigious club event - \\\"this is really happening, it's on, even if Uefa backs down\\\".If it does it will have far reaching implications for the existing leagues around Europe.Finishing in the top four of the Premier League is the biggest prize in English football. The six teams joining the Super League have realised that six doesn't go into four - two miss out every year.'Cynical'Not any more. An insider at the Super League admitted that the plan will seriously dilute the value of the Premier League as a product - the race which is one of its key attractions will be meaningless.We have been down this road before and the former Premier League chief executive suggested that the pandemic had provided a window of opportunity for a very radical proposal that would not have a chance of succeeding in normal times.\\\"There is a cynical opportunism to this,\\\" he said. \\\"They realise that things are chaotic right now and that in many ways - anything goes.\\\"But he added: \\\"Football is about two groups of people. Players and fans. You upset them at your peril.\\\"If fans decide to boycott the matches, that will be a financial disaster, and if Fifa threatens to ban participating players from representing their country in the World Cup - they won't go for it.\\\"If you like jeopardy, the stakes don't get much higher than this."},{"author":"By Damien McGuinness","title":"Annalena Baerbock: Woman who could be Germany's next chancellor - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-56798783","content":"For the first time in their party's four-decade history, the German Greens have announced a candidate to run as chancellor.Equally historic is the central role the Greens will play in September's general election.On Monday, the Green Party announced that 40-year-old Annalena Baerbock would be its choice to take over from Angela Merkel after September's election. Ms Baerbock is likely to be the only woman in the race.Once seen as a chaotic bunch of bearded hippies in sandals, the Greens are now likely to enter the next government.With the conservatives in chaos amid rows over their candidate, the Green Party could even end up the largest in the new coalition. That would mean Annalena Baerbock would be Germany's next chancellor.She's already being compared to young female leaders in New Zealand or Finland.Ms Baerbock was born in 1980, the same year that the party was founded. Her parents took her on anti-nuclear demos. She describes her childhood as a mixture of water cannon at protests, and cake at home later - a mix of cosy middle-class radicalism that sums up the Green Party today, and explains its current mass appeal.According to the most recent poll, the Greens have 22% of the vote, second only to Angela Merkel's conservative CDU\\\/CSU bloc.The conservatives have slumped from over 40% in the summer, when Germany was faring relatively well in the pandemic, to 29%. In some polls the conservatives score even less, putting them a mere four or five percentage points ahead of the Greens.The centre-left SPD has been hovering in the mid- to upper-teens for months. All the other parties are stuck around, or just under, the 10% mark.To make matters worse for the CDU\\\/CSU, the appalling poll numbers don't yet take into account the latest row within the conservatives about their own candidate for chancellor.While the conservative alpha males have been busy tearing themselves apart in an unedifying scramble for power, the Greens quietly got on with choosing their candidate for the top job. With a Kremlin-like secrecy, nothing leaked out until the formal decision on Monday.The new Green leadership has developed an iron grip on party discipline and a thirst for power that Bismarck would have been proud of.But things haven't always been harmonious in the Green Party. Traditionally the conservatives are disciplined and the Greens the chaotic ones.Television footage of the party's founding ceremony looks like a student union meeting, with shaggy-haired young people in hemp shirts and knitted waistcoats shouting passionately.For most of its history the party has been riven by divisions between \\\"Realos\\\", or realists, who believe mainstream society needs to be won over, and \\\"Fundis\\\", or fundamentalists, who view any compromise as a sell-out.In 1998 the Greens entered into their first national governing coalition, as junior partner to the centre-left SPD. The new Green foreign minster, Joschka Fischer, was asked by sniggering journalists whether muesli-eating would be made compulsory.The \\\"Realos\\\" had won - but the battles intensified with the compromises that came with power. In 1999 Mr Fischer was pelted on the head by a bag of red paint at a party conference when he said the Greens would support Nato air strikes in Kosovo.The rows continued for decades, leaving the Greens divided and in the political wilderness nationally.But pragmatic and successful leadership in powerful regional governments showed the Greens could rule effectively.In 2011 the wealthy state of Baden-Württemberg voted in Germany's first regional Green premier, Winfried Kretschmann. With a mix of economic pragmatism and environmental conviction, he has stayed in power and remained popular.Three years ago the party voted for Ms Baerbock and Robert Habeck as joint party leaders - both \\\"Realos\\\" but with an impressive knack of bringing the two wings together. As the Greens' poll numbers soared, opposition faded away.But their march on power won't be easy.The Greens often over-poll and underperform. Voters like to sound virtuous and say they'll vote Green. But when it come to election day, traditional loyalties and pragmatic concerns over the economy kick in.The Greens will also be in the firing line from all sides. The left will call them elitist bourgeois who care more about drinking soy lattes than workers' rights. The right will raise the spectre of preachy moralists who want to ban German cars and sausages.But after 16 years of a distinctly green-tinged Chancellor Merkel - she is phasing out nuclear and coal - Germany has changed. The mainstream is greener, and the Green Party is more mainstream. So anti-Green clichés seem dated, and could insult voters.Either way, the Greens are focused on power. No-one is making jokes about muesli anymore."},{"author":"By Gordon Corera","title":"The GRU: Blast puts spotlight on shadowy Russian force - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-56798784","content":"The revelations that the GRU - Russian military intelligence - was behind the blast at a Czech arms depot in October 2014 that killed two people has sparked a major diplomatic row between Prague and Moscow.But it has also raised questions about what the GRU is capable of, whether it can be deterred and what other operations it may have already undertaken.The mission of Unit 29155 of the GRU is sabotage, subversion and assassination, European intelligence services believe.Following the Salisbury poisoning in the UK in 2018, security services across Europe have been methodically working to trace its actions, following the movements of the 20 or so officers who undertake clandestine missions abroad.This has shone new light on events, like the poisoning of a Bulgarian arms dealer in 2015 as well as the Czech explosion.The unit was also linked to an attempted coup in Montenegro in 2016 aimed at preventing the country aligning with Nato. Alleged agents were convicted in court (in their absence).French security services established that the unit used a region in the Alps as a forward base of operations for travel to other countries. It has also been linked to the offering of bounty payments to the Taliban for attacks on US forces in Afghanistan, although last week US officials said they had only low-to-moderate confidence about this.What lies behind this pattern of activity?Most of the events discovered so far date from after 2014. That year, particularly with the Ukraine crisis, seems to be the point at which the Kremlin began to see itself as in conflict with the West - a conflict fought below the threshold of traditional war and using \\\"grey zone\\\" methods.These ranged from newer online disinformation operations and cyber hacking directed at the West (including the US 2016 election) by some units of the GRU, but also the unleashing of Unit 29155 to undertake more traditional covert action.Some ask whether the revelations from the Czech Republic suggest a sloppiness in the unit's work - for instance the way two men used the same cover identities (Petrov and Boshirov) for that operation and Salisbury. The investigative set Bellingcat has also traced the way GRU operatives sometimes used sequential passport numbers which could be easily linked together.But it has still taken nearly seven years for the Czech case to come to light and just because a team is occasionally sloppy does not mean it is not also dangerous - with two people killed in the Czech Republic and one local woman, Dawn Sturgess, killed near Salisbury by discarded nerve agent.And there may still be more to expose. There are other events - including deaths and explosions - which may be re-evaluated in the light of new evidence and linked to the unit as the travel patterns of the members of the unit are analysed.What has been crucial is that since Salisbury more and more countries have been willing to work together to share information and confront Moscow - finding safety in numbers and increasingly outraged by what they see as Russia's aggressive tactics.It has not just been the UK and the US, but others as well - with Eastern European countries like Poland, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria all taking recent action against Russian spies.But will the exposure serve to deter Russia and the GRU?That may be hard given the way the Kremlin sees the world. Russia has denied all the allegations, saying they are absurd and far-fetched, and it does not appear to be worried by any embarrassment that results.But the hope is that exposure of spies and their operations will at least make it harder for them to operate. For instance, the two men accused of involvement in Salisbury and the Czech explosion are unlikely to be able to travel outside of Russia since their identities have been made public.Others may be trained to take their place though, and few believe that Moscow is likely to rein in its spies."},{"author":"By Tom Heap","title":"The best climate solution you've never heard of - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-56758056","content":"Around the world, there are teams of people who are working to track down and destroy hidden sources of greenhouse gases - stopping them from harming the planet. Some of the gases, which are used in refrigeration, have many times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide.On the outskirts of Guatemala City, Ángel Toledo runs a waste disposal company dealing with metal, plastic and glass.For the last three years they've also started dealing with refrigerant gases - which contribute to climate change. He siphons the gases from household appliances like fridges into refrigerant recovery machines.They are then transferred to a huge tank that's taken to be destroyed once it's full.It's a tangible measure of what Ángel has helped save.\\\"I feel fulfilled,\\\" he says. \\\"I've had this plant for 16 years working with plastic and glass and other waste but I've been working on refrigerants for the last three years.\\\"I feel it's like a dream, helping the environment. Avoiding these gases from reaching the atmosphere. It's an ecstasy being able to help the planet through this work. It's very important for me.\\\"But not everyone is disposing of refrigerant canisters or fridges in the right way.\\\"Unfortunately, you see that a lot and one of the biggest challenges we face is having to change the common practice. You see the cylinders on the street,\\\" he explains.\\\"They vent the gases as they're dealing with equipment or the cylinders and it's going to the atmosphere.\\\"Ángel is part of a chain of people working to stop these gases causing damage to the planet. Teams from Tradewater, a company funded through climate offsetting, are working around the world negotiating with governments, private companies and individuals to find ways to find, secure and destroy the gases safely.Once they get an agreement from the owner and local authorities, they take them somewhere they can be disposed of safely.These teams are jokingly referred to as \\\"ghostbusters\\\", because of the way their cinematic counterparts gathered up troublesome phantoms and stored them together in large \\\"containment units\\\". They doggedly track, trap and destroy rogue gases before they can escape and cause climate havoc.They're also sometimes known as \\\"chill hunters\\\".Almost all fridges and air conditioning units use a gas to transfer the chill or warmth within the unit. This gas is a great insulator - handy in a fridge but not in the atmosphere.Over the last century, the most commonly used gases were CFC (chlorofluorocarbons) and HCFC (hydrochlorofluorocarbons). But when it was discovered they were causing a hole in the ozone layer in the 1980s, they were banned under the Montreal Protocol.Some of them were also potent greenhouse gases: one, called R12 - a CFC - had a global warming potential almost 10,000 times that of CO2. A single 30lb canister of this gas contained the equivalent of 131 tonnes of CO2 in terms of it global warming potential.This is the equivalent of the average UK car driving just over a million kilometres.HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons) were brought in as replacements, and helped save the ozone layer. But some of the early HFCs were, like the ozone-harming gases banned under the Montreal Protocol, potent greenhouse gases.Current legal fridge gases are better, but still have global warming potentials many times greater than carbon dioxide.Scientists estimate that by phasing out HFCs, global warming could be reduced by around half a degree Celsius.Tradewater searches for gas tanks, intact fridges or industrial chillers often stored in old warehouses and waste disposal sites. Sometimes, however, the team arrives too late, finding only punctured tanks, corroded pipes and gases long released.Maria Gutiérrez, Tradewater's director of international programmes, says: \\\"These gases are all over the place - in refrigeration equipment that's in use or not, but also in huge stockpiles of unused material that were purchased and never used, or confiscated when imported illegally into a country many years ago.\\\"These chemicals exist in a legal grey area, so stocks are often hidden as owners may hope to sell them in the future. Sometimes the scrap iron value of the canister alone means that the gas is vented and the metal sold on.Global warming gases are also found in some fridges, freezers and air-conditioners in the UK - which should be disposed of responsibly. It's another reason why fly tipping can be so harmful.Tradewater says its global gas recoveries have already prevented the equivalent of 4-5 million tonnes of CO2 from reaching the atmosphere, but the work continues.Ms Gutiérrez says: \\\"We are only scratching the surface. There is so much more out there.\\\"The Chill Hunters are featured in 39 Ways to Save the Planet on BBC Sounds and on BBC Radio 4 at 13:45 BST for the next two weeks."},{"author":"By Holly Honderich","title":"Time: A love story coloured by incarceration - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-56753968","content":"On Sunday night, a black female director could be awarded an Academy Award for the first time in Oscars history. In her new documentary Time, Garrett Bradley shares a poignant, decades-long story of one Louisiana family's struggle with the US prison system - through the lens of loved ones left behind.In the first few minutes of Time, Sibil Fox Richardson looks straight down the lens and speaks to her husband Robert, then an inmate at the infamous Louisiana State Penitentiary.\\\"Do you see this smile, Robert?\\\" Richardson whispers, beaming at the camera. \\\"Do you know how hard I'm going to be smiling when you come home?\\\"In the clip, taken from a decades-old home video, Richardson's young face nearly fills the frame. She is resolute. \\\"I feel like a champion,\\\" she says.In the next shot, we see the same face, but aged, with grey hair at her temples. Richardson is nearing 50 and Robert has still not come home.In September 1997, Richardson and her high school sweetheart Robert tried to rob a Louisiana bank. Newly married, the two had opened a hip-hop clothing store in Shreveport. But they struggled, becoming \\\"desperate\\\", Richardson tells us, with the store at risk of going under.Richardson, who is now known as Fox Rich, accepted a plea bargain with a 13-year sentence and was released after three and a half. Robert, advised by his lawyer not to take a plea deal, got 60 years without the possibility of parole.Bradley's film does not dwell on the crime. She is more interested in the time that comes after. And rather than take us inside with Robert, Bradley trains her lens on those left behind. \\\"It became really clear to me that there was a voice absent from the conversation around incarceration from a woman's point of view, from a family's point of view,\\\" Bradley said in a phone interview from her home in southern California.Her film follows Rich in recent years as she fights for Robert's release, and pieces together the earlier years of his sentence with an archive of home video that shows her raising the couple's six sons.The US prison system was \\\"invisible by design\\\", Bradley said. \\\"In many cases the only evidence of what was happening is in those that are serving time on the outside.\\\"Bradley, who is 35, was born and raised in New York City, the daughter of two visual artists. She studied religion at Smith College in Massachusetts before becoming a full-time filmmaker. Much of her work so far - including a handful of shorts and a fiction feature, Below Dreams - has explored the images of Black America that have been mostly left off screen.Her 2017 short documentary, Alone, followed a young woman wrestling with whether she should marry her incarcerated boyfriend and started her focus on the prison system. Alone is the cinematic sister to Time, Bradley said, not least because it introduced her to Rich, who makes a brief but memorable appearance.Bradley had originally intended Time to be a short film - matching Alone's running time at around 12 minutes. But on the last day of filming, Rich presented her with a bag filled with mini-DV tapes, totalling 100 hours of home videos.The archival footage shows a young Rich talking thoughtfully to her absent husband and mugging for the camera. It shows the six boys riding bicycles, blowing out birthday candles, growing from toothless kindergarteners to college graduates - all while their mother waits for Robert to come home.Bradley had already begun filming the short documentary in black and white when she was presented with Rich's old videos, which had been recorded in lush colour. She decided to convert the home footage to black and white to match. The colour scheme gave a \\\"superficial sense of linearity\\\", Bradley said. \\\"The black and white sort of became the saran wrap over the whole film.\\\"The result is a slow-paced film that slides quietly back and forward in time. Bradley forgoes any traditional signposting like on-screen dates or names. We estimate how much time has passed by the age of Rich's sons and the lines on her face.The United States locks up more people per capita than any other country in the world, with some 2.1 million people in jails or prisons. Those behind bars are disproportionately Latino, Native American and African American. Black people are five times more likely than white people to be imprisoned. And the Rich family's home state of Louisiana has a higher rate of incarceration than anywhere else in the US.Another film may have explored the details of the country's formidable prison system. Bradley's does not. There are no scenes shot from inside Angola, Louisiana's state penitentiary, no images of Robert in a prison jumpsuit. In the documentary we see the prison only from the sky.When Bradley considered trying to explain US incarceration, she found herself \\\"trying to explain racism in America\\\", she told filmmaker Ava DuVernay.What she gives us instead is more immediate, an 80-minute close up of one woman and her love story. Bradley's shots are intense and patient, often set against the swelling piano chords of Ethiopian composer - and nun - Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou. But Rich's voice and face dominate.Before they began shooting, Rich and Robert told Bradley that they wanted their story to offer hope to other families affected by incarceration, Bradley said. And in front of Bradley's camera and her own, Rich is an almost unfailing picture of purpose and optimism.\\\"We start every year knowing that this is going to be the year my husband comes down,\\\" she says in the film. As each year goes by, she says, \\\"Next year is the year.\\\"Bradley seems to have made a conscious decision to show Rich the way she wants to be seen: powerful and sure. On phone calls with court clerks, desperate for information on Robert's pending release, she remains achingly polite while bounced from person to person, none of whom provide help. In just two scenes do we see her break. In one, Rich cries as she speaks of her twins. Not yet born when Robert was sentenced, their approaching 18th birthdays mark the length of his absence.\\\"I think there's a tendency for us to feel that one's vulnerability is somehow more true than their resilience and their strength,\\\" Bradley said. \\\"As a filmmaker, I make the choice to lean into their strength.\\\"After 21 years inside, Robert is finally released, his sentence commuted by Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards. In a film haunted by Robert's absence, his presence is almost implausible.Their drive home together brings us one of the film's most poignant scenes - evidence of the close relationship developed between Bradley and Rich (described by Rich as \\\"love at first sight\\\"). Shot in slow motion by Nisa East, one of Bradley's cinematographers, we watch Rich and Robert, their clothes now removed, eyes locked, in a moment of intimacy in the backseat - and apparently unaware of the camera. For Rich, a woman so in control of her own image, it is only time in the film she forgets herself.\\\"I wanted to be with my love,\\\" Rich has said in interviews of her two decade fight for Robert. \\\"There was nothing they could do or say that was going to stop me from putting my family together again.\\\"In its final sequence, the documentary rewinds, playing a montage of home videos in reverse - the boys playing in backyard pools and bunk beds, a pregnancy and a birth. It runs all the way back to another kiss in another car between Robert and Rich from before the crime - showing both the time reclaimed and the time that was lost.To Bradley, it was a sort of re-creation, an effort to match the images made in Robert's mind while he waited inside.\\\"It was something I wanted to give to Robert,\\\" she said.."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Why Russia's GRU military intelligence service is so feared - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-56798001","content":"If the definition of a successful intelligence service is obscurity, the GRU is probably Russia's most effective spy agency.In communist times, the KGB became a byword in the West for Soviet spooks, whether they were infiltrating corridors of power abroad or suppressing dissidents at home, but few people ever heard of the GRU (an acronym pronounced like the English word \\\"grew\\\").Yet the military intelligence service - GRU stands for Main Intelligence Directorate - outlasted the KGB when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and appears to be flourishing today.The UK blames it for the Salisbury nerve agent attack of 2018 - when a former GRU officer living in Britain was poisoned along with his daughter - and the US blames it for major cyber attacks. Its operatives are also believed to have been active in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.This month the two alleged GRU agents accused of the Salisbury attack were connected by the authorities in the Czech Republic to a deadly arms depot blast on its territory in 2014.What do we know for certain about the GRU?Russia has had a formal military intelligence service for more than 200 years, since the Special Bureau was set up during the Napoleonic wars.After the Russian Revolution in 1917, it was reorganised and became known as the GRU in 1942 - at the height of the Second World War, when it was tasked with gathering intelligence abroad on Germany and its allies. During the Cold War, one of its notable early successes was to penetrate Britain's atom bomb programme.As well as running agents, the GRU has its own spetsnaz (special ops) commandos, whose mission is to conduct reconnaissance and sabotage. In Soviet times, they were active in conflict zones around the world, and spearheaded the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.When the Soviet Union broke up, the GRU's great rival, the KGB secret police, split in two - a domestic version called the FSB (which Russian President Vladimir Putin once led) and a foreign service called the SVR - but the GRU remained intact.It did change its name in 2010 from the Main Intelligence Directorate to the Main Directorate (the GU), but the GRU acronym stuck.A report for the US Congress describes the GRU as a \\\"large, expansive, and powerful organisation\\\" but very little is known for certain about its size and operations.There is only a brief mention of its role as a foreign intelligence agency on the website of the Russian defence ministry - it has no website of its own.It is, the ministry says, tasked with \\\"ensuring conditions conducive to the successful implementation of the Russian Federation's defence and security policy\\\" and providing officials with intelligence \\\"they need to make decisions in the political, economic, defence, scientific, technical and environmental areas\\\".So great is the secrecy which surrounds the GRU that when its then director, Igor Sergun, died suddenly in 2016, the Kremlin did not give the cause or place of death in its initial announcement.What is the GRU known for today?Sergun, in the post from 2011, had been placed on EU and US sanctions lists targeting top Russian officials after Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. The EU also held him \\\"responsible for the activity of GRU officers\\\" supporting rebels in east Ukraine's bloody conflict.Security analysts credit Sergun with building up the GRU after it suffered drastic cuts, and the agency proved more effective on the ground in Ukraine than the FSB. One of the top commanders on the rebel side - Igor Girkin, alias Strelkov - was accused of being a GRU operative by the EU, which included him on the sanctions list.Sergun did not live to see the impact of a very different kind of secret operation attributed to the GRU: the hacking of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and the US Democratic Party, which saw the release of tens of thousands of private communications in an apparent effort to discredit a candidate seen as hostile to Russia.The justice department eventually charged 12 Russians with the cyber attack. All were accused of being GRU officers. The Kremlin responded by saying there was no evidence linking the 12 to military intelligence or hacking.If the GRU did indeed mount operations in Ukraine and against the US Democrats, then they certainly achieved what were presumably their goals: the rebels retain control of their territory in east Ukraine to this day, and Hillary Clinton famously lost the 2016 election to Donald Trump.But other operations attributed to the agency appear to have been spectacular flops, albeit with deadly consequences as in Salisbury, where a woman died.The two alleged GRU operatives who went to the UK not only failed to assassinate their presumed target, Sergei Skripal, but left a trail of evidence behind them like bungling amateurs - unless, of course, their disregard for CCTV cameras was deliberately brazen, meant to send a signal that Russia is prepared to take high risks in pursuit of its security goals.Mr Skripal, convicted of treason and jailed in Russia, had been released in a spy swap in 2010.In the same year as the Salisbury attack, four other suspected GRU agents were caught red-handed in the Netherlands trying to hack the wifi network of the chemical weapons watchdog, the OPCW, which was investigating the Skripal poisoning as well as a chemical attack in Syria.Like the Salisbury suspects, they had left a trail of evidence online as well as on paper, although they were allowed to return to Russia by the Dutch authorities.\\\"The GRU has been extremely active, and inevitably some of those operations are going to be blown,\\\" security analyst Mark Galeotti told BBC News at the time. \\\"That doesn't mean they are fools. Clearly the guidance they are getting is, within bounds: it doesn't really matter. Don't worry too much about the fallout.\\\""},{"author":"By Nathalia Passarinho and Luis Barrucho","title":"Why are so many babies dying of Covid-19 in Brazil? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-latin-america-56696907","content":"More than a year into the pandemic, deaths in Brazil are now at their peak. But despite the overwhelming evidence that Covid-19 rarely kills young children, in Brazil 1,300 babies have died from the virus. One doctor refused to test Jessika Ricarte's one-year-old son for Covid, saying his symptoms did not fit the profile of the virus. Two months later he died of complications from the disease.After two years of trying, and failed fertility treatments, teacher Jessika Ricarte had all but given up on having a family. Then she fell pregnant with Lucas.\\\"His name comes from luminous. And he was a light in our life. He showed that happiness was much more than we imagined,\\\" she says.She first suspected something was wrong when Lucas, always a good eater, lost his appetite.At first Jessika wondered if he was teething. Lucas's godmother, a nurse, suggested that he might just have a sore throat. But after he developed a fever, then fatigue and slightly laboured breathing, Jessika took him to hospital, and asked for him to be tested for Covid.\\\"The doctor put on the oximeter. Lucas's levels were 86%. Now I know that is not normal,\\\" says Jessika.But he was not feverish, so the doctor said: \\\"My dear, don't worry. There's no need for a Covid test. It's probably just a minor sore throat.\\\"He told Jessika that Covid-19 was rare in children, gave her some antibiotics and sent her home. Despite her misgivings, there was no option to have Lucas tested privately at the time.Jessika says that some of his symptoms dissipated at the end of his 10-day antibiotics course, but the tiredness remained - as did her concerns about coronavirus.\\\"I sent several videos to his godmother, my parents, my mother-in-law, and everyone said that I was exaggerating, that I should stop watching the news, that it was making me paranoid. But I knew that my son was not himself, that he was not breathing normally.\\\"This was May 2020, and the coronavirus epidemic was growing. Two people had already died in her town, Tamboril in Ceará, north-east Brazil. \\\"Everyone knows each other here. The town was in shock.\\\"Jessika's husband Israel was worried that another hospital visit would increase the risk that she and Lucas would become infected with the virus.But the weeks went by, and Lucas became sleepier and sleepier. Finally on 3 June, Lucas vomited over and over again after eating lunch, and Jessika knew she had to act.They returned to their local hospital, where the doctor tested Lucas for Covid, to rule it out.Lucas's godmother, who worked there, broke the news to the couple that his test result was positive.\\\"At the time, the hospital did not even have a resuscitator,\\\" says Jessika.Lucas was transferred to a paediatric intensive care unit in Sobral, over two hours away, where he was diagnosed with a condition called multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS).This is an extreme immune response to the virus, which can cause inflammation of vital organs.Experts say the syndrome, which affects children up to six weeks after they are infected with coronavirus, is rare, but leading epidemiologist Dr Fatima Marinho from the University of São Paolo, says that, during the pandemic, she is seeing more cases of MIS than ever before. Although it doesn't account for all deaths.When Lucas was intubated, Jessika wasn't allowed to stay in the same room. She rang her sister-in-law to try and distract herself.\\\"We could still hear the sound of the machine, the beep, until the machine stopped and there was that constant beep. And we know that happens when the person dies. After a few minutes, the machine started working again and I started to cry.\\\"The doctor told her Lucas had suffered a cardiac arrest but they had managed to revive him.Dr Manuela Monte, the paediatric doctor who treated Lucas for over a month in the ICU in Sobral, said she was surprised that Lucas's condition was so serious, because he did not have any risk factors.Most children affected by Covid have comorbidities - existing conditions such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease - or are overweight, according to Lohanna Tavares, a paediatric infectologist at Albert Sabin Children's Hospital in Fortaleza, the state capital.But that wasn't the case with Lucas.During the 33 days Lucas was in the ICU, Jessika was only allowed to see him three times. Lucas needed immunoglobulin - a very expensive medication - to deflate his heart, but luckily an adult patient who had bought his own had donated one leftover ampoule to the hospital. Lucas was so ill that he went on to receive a second dose of immunoglobulin. He developed a rash on his body and was running a persistent fever. He needed support to breathe.Then Lucas began to improve and the doctors decided to take out his oxygen tube. They video-called Jessika and Israel so that he wouldn't feel alone as he regained consciousness.\\\"When he heard our voices he started to cry,\\\" says Jessika.It was the last time they were to see their boy react. During the next video call \\\"he had a paralysed look\\\". The hospital requested a CT scan and discovered Lucas had had a stroke.Still, the couple were told Lucas would make a good recovery with the right care and would soon be moved out of ICU and into a general ward.When Jessika and Israel went to visit him, the doctor was just as hopeful as they were, she says.\\\"That night, I put my cell phone on silent. I dreamed Lucas came up to me and kissed my nose. And the dream was a great feeling of love, gratitude and I woke up very happy. Then I saw my cell phone and saw the 10 calls that the doctor had made.\\\"The doctor told Jessika that Lucas's heart rate and oxygen levels had dropped suddenly, and he had died early that morning.She feels sure that if Lucas had been given a Covid test when she had requested it back in early May he would have survived.\\\"It is important that doctors, even if they believe it is not Covid, do the test to eliminate the possibility,\\\" she says.\\\"A baby does not say what he is feeling, so we depend on tests.\\\"Jessika believes that the delay in proper treatment made his condition more serious. \\\"Lucas had several inflammations, 70% of the lung was compromised, the heart increased by 40%. It was a situation that could have been avoided.\\\"Dr Monte, who treated Lucas, agrees. She says that although MIS cannot be prevented, treatment is much more successful if the condition is diagnosed and treated early.\\\"The earlier he would have received specialised care, the better,\\\" she says. \\\"He arrived at the hospital already critically ill. I believe he could have had a different outcome if we could have treated him earlier.\\\"Jessika now wants to share Lucas's story to help others who may miss critical symptoms.\\\"Every child I know was saved by some warning and the mother says: 'I saw your posts, I took my son to the hospital and he is now at home.' It's as if it were a little bit of Lucas,\\\" she says.\\\"I have been doing for these people what I wish they had done for me. If I had had information, I would have been even more cautious.\\\"There is a misconception that children are at zero risk for Covid, says Dr Fatima Marinho, who is also a senior adviser to the international health NGO Vital Strategies. Marinho's research has found that a shockingly high number of children and babies have been affected by the virus.Between February 2020 and 15 March 2021, Covid-19 killed at least 852 of Brazil's children up to the age of nine, including 518 babies under one year old, according to figures from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. But Dr Marinho estimates that more than twice this number of children died of Covid. A serious problem of underreporting due to lack of Covid testing is bringing the numbers down, she says.Dr Marinho calculated the excess of deaths by unspecified acute respiratory syndrome during the pandemic, and found that there were 10 times more deaths by unexplained respiratory syndrome than in previous years. By adding these numbers, she estimates that the virus in fact killed 2,060 children under nine years old, including 1,302 babies.Why is this happening?Experts say the sheer number of Covid cases in the country - the second-highest number in the world - have increased the likelihood that Brazil's babies and young children are affected.\\\"Of course, the more cases we have and, as a result, the more hospitalisations, the greater the number of deaths in all age groups, including children. But if the pandemic were controlled, this scenario could evidently be minimised,\\\" says Renato Kfouri, president of the Scientific Department of Immunisations of the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics.Such a high infection rate has overwhelmed Brazil's entire health care system. Across the country, oxygen supplies are dwindling, there is a shortage of basic medicines and in many ICUs across the country there are simply no more beds.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro continues to oppose lockdowns and the infection rate is being driven by a variant called P.1 which emerged in Manaus, in northern Brazil, last year, and is thought to be much more contagious. Twice the number of people died last month than in any other month of the pandemic, and the upward trend is continuing.Another problem driving the high rates in children is a lack of testing.Marinho says that for children often the Covid diagnosis comes too late, when they are already seriously ill. \\\"We have a serious problem detecting cases. We don't have enough tests for the general population, even fewer for children. Because there is a delay in the diagnosis, there is a delay in care for the child,\\\" she says.This is not just because there is little testing capacity, but also because it is easier to miss, or misdiagnose, the symptoms of children suffering from Covid-19, as the disease tends to present differently in younger people.\\\"A child has a lot more diarrhoea, a lot more abdominal pain, and chest pain, than the classic Covid picture. Because there is a delay in diagnosis, when the child arrives at the hospital they are in a serious condition and can end up complicating - and dying,\\\" she says.But it's also about poverty and access to health care.An observational study of 5,857 Covid-19 patients under the age of 20, carried out by Brazilian paediatricians led by Braian Sousa from the São Paolo school of medicine, identified both comorbidities and socioeconomic vulnerabilities as risk factors for the worst outcome of Covid-19 in children.Marinho agrees this is an important factor. \\\"Most vulnerable are black children, and those from very poor families, as they have the most difficulty accessing help. These are the children most at risk of death.\\\" She says this is because crowded housing conditions make it impossible to socially distance when infected, and because poorer communities do not have access to a local ICU.These children are also at risk of malnutrition, which is \\\"terrible for the immune response\\\", Marinho says.

But it is easy to forget he had endured an exceptionally turbulent childhood, writes historian Philip Eade.He was abruptly separated from his parents and four elder sisters at the age of eight, and destined never again to live in the same home as his immediate family.In later years, while out and about on royal duties, he would gain a reputation for his quizzical, ragging and, at times, startlingly blunt remarks. And to friends, his emotional reserve was every bit as striking as his bluff, no-nonsense exterior.His tendency to hide his feelings meant that even those who knew him well were occasionally taken aback by his bouts of prickliness - presumed to be legacies of his unsettled early life.Prince Philip was born in Corfu in 1921 eight years after the assassination of his grandfather, King George I of Greece.He was the youngest child and only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg.He was little more than a year old when his father was sent into exile by an army court martial following Greece's calamitous defeat in a war with Turkey.The family's subsequent flight across the Adriatic Sea to Italy aboard a British warship, with the infant Philip sleeping in a converted orange crate, was helped by King George V of the UK, Andrew's first cousin. The monarch's determination to rescue them owed much to his regret at having failed to save another first cousin, Tsar Nicholas II, during the Russian Revolution five years earlier.Eventually, the family settled on the outskirts of Paris at St-Cloud, in a garden cottage owned by Philip's aunt. Philip attended a small day school nearby, but in 1930 his world was again thrown apart when his mother, whom he had always adored, suffered a severe mental breakdown.Alice, who was the daughter of Prince Louis of Battenberg (whose family name was anglicised to Mountbatten during World War One), had been born profoundly deaf. She learned to lip-read in several different languages.Brave, energetic and determined not to let disability hold her back, she had served as a latter-day Florence Nightingale during the Balkan Wars of 1912-13, setting up and nursing in front-line hospitals.Three decades later, during the war-time Nazi German occupation of Greece, she hid Jews in her house in Athens, earning, like Oskar Schindler, Israel's award of Righteous Among the Nations.In the years immediately after the family's flight from Greece, however, her behaviour had grown disturbingly strange. One doctor who saw her, diagnosed her as a paranoid schizophrenic who believed that she was the only woman on Earth, and married to Christ.Eventually, Alice's mother (Philip's grandmother) bowed to the advice of psychiatrists, and agreed that her daughter should be committed to a secure sanatorium. So she arranged - while the family was staying for Easter 1930 with Alice's uncle, the Grand Duke of Hesse - for a doctor to arrive one day while the children were out. He would forcibly sedate Alice, bundle her into a car and drive her off to a clinic near Lake Constance.The committal of Philip's mother, on 2 May, marked the end of his family life, although he and his sisters would not have realised this when they arrived back at the grand-ducal palace that evening to find their mother gone.Alice and Andrew's marriage had been under strain for several years but it, in effect, ended at that point. They hardly saw each other from then on, although they would never divorce.Andrew stopped acting as her husband. He freed himself from many of his responsibilities as father too, shutting up the family home at St-Cloud and thereafter leading a rather aimless life, drifting between Paris, Monte Carlo and Germany, interspersed with sporadic fruitless interventions in Greek affairs.He saw Philip now and again during the school holidays, but otherwise left him in the care of Alice's family, the Milford Havens and Mountbattens, in England.Within 18 months of the family break-up, Philip's sisters were all married to German princelings, so the disappearance of both their parents was of far less consequence for them than it was for their eight-year-old brother.First, he lived with his maternal grandmother at Kensington Palace, before moving in with his uncle, Alice's elder brother George, the Marquess of Milford Haven - whose son David would become Philip's closest childhood friend (and later best man).For the next eight years, \\\"Uncle Georgie\\\" acted as Philip's guardian, turning up in loco parentis at school prize-givings and sports days. During some school holidays, he provided a home for Philip at Lynden Manor, on the Thames between Windsor and Maidenhead.Philip only saw his mother a handful of times during the first two years of her confinement.At the sanatorium, Alice was told her son would be going to boarding school at Cheam in England - her daughter Cecilie careful to reassure her that, although at first nervous at the idea, Philip had become \\\"thrilled\\\" at the prospect.For five years, from the summer of 1932 to the spring of 1937 - by which time she had largely recovered her equilibrium - Philip neither saw nor heard from his mother at all. It was not in his nature to overstate the effect of all this. \\\"I just had to get on with it,\\\" he later told one biographer.\\\"You do. One does.\\\"Yet being separated from his mother at such a critical stage in his upbringing undoubtedly left its mark.However fond he was of his grandmother, uncle and aunt, and appreciative of the homes they provided him, they could never make up for the family home he had lost.When an interviewer asked him what language he had spoken at home as a boy, his immediate and rather cross retort was: \\\"What do you mean, 'at home'?\\\"His apparent way of coping was to banish introspection and remain cheerful and purposeful. In the absence of his own father, various surrogates helped shape the young prince's increasingly forthright character.The headmaster of Cheam was a cheerful clergyman and staunch disciplinarian who used a cane to punish daytime offences and a sawn-off cricket bat for those caught having pillow fights after lights out.Philip's first beating as a new boy prompted him to ask the headmaster's wife: \\\"Do you like Mr Taylor?\\\" The experienced Mrs Taylor countered expertly. \\\"Do you, Philip?\\\" she asked. \\\"No,\\\" answered the boy unequivocally. \\\"I do not.\\\"But as time passed, Philip grew to like not only Mr Taylor but also everything else about Cheam, the tough regime of which he later extolled in a preface to a history of the school: \\\"Children may be indulged at home, but school is expected to be a Spartan and disciplined experience in the process of developing into self-controlled, considerate and independent adults. The system may have its eccentricities, but there can be little doubt that these are far outweighed by its values.\\\"His more timid and sensitive son, Prince Charles, who had a miserable time at Cheam, may not have entirely agreed with this assessment. He also found it impossible to share his father's enthusiasm for Gordonstoun, an even more Spartan educational establishment in Moray, where Philip went at the age of 13 and eventually rose to be head boy.Philip's housemaster at Gordonstoun, Robert Chew, was also in charge of \\\"character building\\\" at the school during its early years. By the time Prince Charles was sent there, Chew had risen to headmaster and Charles later shuddered when he remembered him as \\\"a remote and austere character who adhered to the founder's beliefs with the conviction of a true disciple\\\".The founder he referred to was Kurt Hahn, an eccentric Jewish emigre from Salem School in Germany, where Philip had spent a year just after the rise of Hitler in 1933-34.Hahn, the prince's most influential mentor during his time at Gordonstoun, pitted his young charges against what he declared was a five-fold decay of civilisation - the decay of fitness, the decay of initiative and enterprise, the decay of care and skill, the decay of self-discipline, and the decay of compassion.Hahn and Gordonstoun provided Prince Philip with a much-needed sense of stability after the various upheavals of his childhood. But his later years there were overshadowed by the death of his sister Cecilie, and her family, in a plane crash on their way to London for a family wedding in 1937.It fell to Hahn to break the news to 16-year-old Philip, who would never forget the \\\"profound shock\\\" with which he listened in the headmaster's study to what had happened.Perhaps more resilient than most boys due to the various other blows he had suffered before that, he \\\"did not break down\\\", so his headmaster later recorded. \\\"His sorrow was that of a man.\\\"Six months later, Philip suffered yet more sorrow when his guardian Georgie Milford Haven died from cancer at the age of 45.An obscure figure in most accounts of the Mountbatten family, in terms of sheer intelligence and ability and charm, Georgie was as remarkable as any of them.At the age of 10, he set up a workshop at his father's castle, equipped with lathes, a forge and foundry. So it was no surprise that as a young naval officer, he would go on to design a system of fans, radiators and thermostats for air-conditioning his quarters. He even fashioned a device, controlled by an alarm clock, for making his early morning tea - 20 years before such a gadget appeared on the market.His remarkable ingenuity helped fire his nephew Philip's budding interest in invention and design, and when Philip grew up, he too would be forever in search of the latest gadgets.Many who knew Georgie had confidently predicted a brilliant career, and that he would, like his father, eventually succeed to the position of First Sea Lord. But he lacked the obsessive zeal and ambition that characterised his more dazzling younger brother, Louis Mountbatten, known in the family as \\\"Dickie\\\", who now stepped in and took over what remained of the job of bringing their nephew up.Mountbatten later maintained that he had already marked Philip down as \\\"an exceptional person\\\", the telling moment having been \\\"out shooting one day, when he was eight or nine. It was rough. The way he coped, told me.\\\"Having no son of his own served to focus Mountbatten's attention on his nephew and, although Philip occasionally bridled at his uncle's often showy assumption of parental responsibility, there is no doubt that he had an important influence on him. It was Mountbatten who steered Philip away from his original intention to become a fighter pilot and towards a career in the Royal Navy.Most crucially, it was his uncle who arranged for Philip to entertain Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret on the eve of war in 1939, during a royal visit to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. By this time, Philip was a cadet there.It was on this occasion that Princess Elizabeth famously fell in love with the handsome young prince, and she never appears to have contemplated marrying anyone else.She was only 13 at the time, however, and it wasn't until several years later, while on leave from active service and staying at Windsor for Christmas 1943, that Prince Philip, five years her senior, first showed signs of reciprocating her feelings.The romance began in earnest soon after the end of the war, and it is generally assumed that he proposed to her while staying at Balmoral in the summer of 1946.King George VI was at first far from eager to give his consent, not least since several of his closest friends were vehemently opposed to Philip. They whispered darkly about his \\\"Teutonic strain\\\" and suspected that his uncle Louis Mountbatten, a notorious intriguer, was proposing to use him as a Trojan horse to help bring the monarchy more into line with his own \\\"rather pink\\\" political outlook.Mountbatten had long been viewed by courtiers as unsound on account of his friendliness with Labour politicians such as Tom Driberg - not to mention Mountbatten's notoriously left-wing wife, Edwina.But the King's misgivings about the prospective match had far more to do with his reluctance to break up his close family unit - \\\"Us Four\\\", as he called them - so soon after the war, and to lose his beloved eldest daughter at such a young age.For Prince Philip, on the other hand, the prospect of marriage to Princess Elizabeth offered the chance at long last for him to regain the family life that he had lost at the age of eight.One of his more telling thank-you letters to Queen Elizabeth, after staying with the Royal Family, bore moving testimony to how much he relished \\\"the simple enjoyment of family pleasures and amusements and the feeling that I am welcome to share them\\\".Having been deprived of these \\\"simple pleasures\\\" at such a young age, he was understandably eager now to start a family of his own.His raising of that family - the Royal Family - stands alongside his support for the Queen and modernising influence on the monarchy as his most important legacies.- Philip Eade is the author of Young Prince Philip: His Turbulent Early Life"},{"author":"By Iain Watson and Jennifer Scott","title":"Race report: Was controversy part of the plan? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-politics-56578839","content":"Did the government set out to cause controversy with an investigation into racial disparity in the UK? Or was the report's release, on Wednesday, mishandled?We spoke to former and current Conservative insiders, on condition of anonymity, to find out how the report had come together - and the way in which it was communicated to the media.It's fair to say that the report by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, prompted by last year's Black Lives Matter protests, was not universally welcomed.Among the critics were the race equality think tank the Runnymede Trust, the TUC, an NHS employers' group, a range of politicians and some of those involved in last year's protests.Oh, and by implication, Sam Kasumu, too.Those close to Mr Kasumu say he resigned as Boris Johnson's adviser for civil society and communities - with a remit to reach out to ethnic minority communities - in anticipation of the report hitting the media.He was already known to be unhappy with the direction the government was going in on race.He had tried to resign in February - but was persuaded to stay on so that he could help vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi in the campaign to encourage more people from ethnic minority backgrounds to get a Covid jab.In his original resignation letter, that was later rescinded, he talked of his fears for \\\"what may become of the (Conservative) party in the future by choosing to pursue a \\\"politics steeped in division\\\".And sources inside Downing Street say that in the time between that letter being retracted, and his actual resignation, an \\\"awkward silence\\\" had descended - with little discussion or engagement on the issues that he raised.So did the government get its messaging wrong when it published the report this week or was the backlash in some quarters the result of a deliberate strategy?'Uncomfortable debate'The commission's report runs to 258 pages, but some conclusions had been briefed to the media in advance of its publication on Wednesday.These included a call to ditch the commonly-used acronym BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) and data on the improving educational attainment of people from most ethnic minority backgrounds.But perhaps the most controversial finding, and the one that grabbed the most headlines, was that the UK was not institutionally racist.One source we spoke to praised the handling of the report \\\"from a comms perspective\\\".He said No 10 knew that a row was going to be inevitable so by briefing key elements of a contentious report in advance, it had allowed that row to take place on the government's terms.\\\"The government knows how uncomfortable it is for Labour to have those debates,\\\" said the source. \\\"Some people feel their history and culture is being trashed by the Left.\\\"Is Britain a racist country?There were many non-contentious recommendations in the report, and a lot of nuance, he added.But the initial communications strategy had not focused so much on what needed to change, rather on posing the question - is Britain a racist country?The report found that while there was racism, the answer to that question was \\\"no\\\", and that that would make people feel proud not ashamed of progress that had been made.The commission's chairman Tony Sewell put it like this: \\\"We no longer see a Britain where the system is deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities.\\\"The impediments and disparities do exist, they are varied, and ironically very few of them are directly to do with racism.\\\"Too often 'racism' is the catch-all explanation, and can be simply implicitly accepted rather than explicitly examined.\\\"Labour politicians, our source suggested, were being tempted to disagree - and trapped into denouncing \\\"structural racism\\\".'Moths around the flame'This, in turn, could allow the Conservatives to suggest the opposition was \\\"talking the country down\\\" and had not moved as far away from the Corbyn era as the new leadership, under Sir Keir Starmer, claimed.Many of the commissioners, who had helped put the report together over the past 10 months, urged people to see it in the round - and to take on board its 24 recommendations.These included beefing up the Equality and Human Rights Commission to challenge policies or practices that cause significant and unjust racial disadvantage, or arise from racial discrimination.The report also called on the government to tackle online abuse as a matter of urgency.One of the 11 commissioners, Keith Fraser - a former police superintendent, and chair of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales describes the reaction to some aspects of the report as \\\"like a torch\\\" being lit.\\\"There were moths around the flame, running towards it. They (the critics) didn't look either side of the light. They need to turn on the fluorescent light and illuminate the whole room.\\\"But the initial terms of the debate, via the very focused beams of light in briefings to the press, were set by government in advance - a technique known in politics as \\\"getting your retaliation in first\\\".Expectation of successBut what of the substance of the report? As one insider put it: \\\"It isn't just a press release.\\\"The plan of a commission had been announced by the prime minister last June, after the Black Lives Matter protests and the \\\"statue wars\\\".At the time, Boris Johnson had said: \\\"We have to look at discrimination but what has slightly been lost in this is the story of success.\\\"What I want to do as prime minister is change the narrative so we stop the sense of victimhood and discrimination, we stamp out racism... and we start to have a real expectation of success.\\\"Statements like this had led critics inside Mr Johnson's own party - and inside government - to suggest that some of the conclusions of the report were, in effect, determined in advance - particularly the claim that the system is not deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities.The commission was set up by Munira Mirza, Mr Johnson's policy chief, who had been deputy mayor for education and culture when he was mayor of London.She had previously questioned the notion of institutional racism.When Theresa May, as prime minister, set up a racial disparities audit, Ms Mirza was quoted as saying: \\\"It reinforces this idea that ethnic minorities are being systematically oppressed, that there's a sort of institutional problem, when in fact what we've seen in the last 20 years is a liberalisation, an opening up for many people.\\\"An independent report?She suggested the educationalist - and former teacher - Tony Sewell should chair the commission, and the prime minister formally asked him to do so.Mr Sewell, too, had questioned the existence of systemic racism in the UK.In a 2010 article for Prospect magazine, he suggested that \\\"much of the supposed evidence of institutional racism is flimsy\\\".One source told us: \\\"This was not an independent report as such. It was very much driven by Munira.\\\"Another said: \\\"This isn't even the 'Downing Street' view. There are different views across No 10.\\\"These views are those of a faction - Munira and her husband Dougie Smith in particular. They wanted to turn the assumption of Theresa May's disparities audit on its head.\\\"Don't get me wrong - Theresa's audit wasn't totally without cynicism. She wanted to portray herself as a One Nation Tory.\\\"But this report was really a reaction to BLM with a foregone conclusion.\\\"Boris was dealing with a political problem, reacting to BLM - he hasn't really deeply considered this.\\\"Others, though, disagree.One source said that Boris Johnson was attracted to Munira Mirza's way of thinking because he is an \\\"optimistic, sunlit upland guy\\\" and wanted, for example, the successes of those from ethnic backgrounds to be celebrated.'Fatalistic narrative'But it also goes much deeper than that, they suggested.While the Left \\\"emoted\\\" on race, the prime minister wanted a data-driven report.And if there was success for some groups in the education system, for example, that should be set out, not buried.The thinking was that to improve the life chances of people from ethnic minority backgrounds, they had to be told what they could achieve.Otherwise, if they were led to believe that the odds were completely stacked against them from the start, and that there was little they could do about it, they may not have the incentive to try.It's what Tony Sewell described as a \\\"fatalistic narrative\\\".But Boris Johnson also wanted the complex nature of disadvantage to be recognised and practical proposals to deal with problems where they were actually occurring.The report's foreword says: \\\"The evidence shows that geography, family influence, socio-economic background, culture and religion have more significant impact on life chances than the existence of racism.\\\"'Not a stitch-up'And one of the commissioners, Keith Fraser, is annoyed at the suggestion the findings were a foregone conclusion.He told the BBC: \\\"It irritates me when people call it a stitch-up.\\\"It was really challenging and we challenged each other. If it is was a stitch-up, I wouldn't have been involved in it. That is absolute rubbish - and you can underline that.\\\"The commission came to this amongst an awful lot of debate, around the death of George Floyd and Black Lives Matter, but it was a journey, not just about that, but about the decades before.\\\"I don't think there is anybody out there who can say the UK hasn't changed and changed for the better, but we mustn't think that the job is done.\\\"We are not saying we are in utopia, running around the garden, but the point is to capitalise and leap forward.\\\"Conservative criticsNonetheless, there are critics of the commission's report within senior ranks of the Conservative Party.One veteran of Theresa May's audit of disparities welcomed the report's embrace of the complexity of disadvantage.But his concerns were that the report tipped over into suggesting that some people's experience of racism was being seen as not true, or exaggerated.He argued that some of the most disadvantaged people do believe, rightly or wrongly, that they live in a racist country.That is their \\\"lived experience\\\", he added, and to take them on a \\\"journey\\\" you need to realise where they are starting from.Another Conservative source said \\\"we know inequality is complicated\\\", but the report was \\\"tone deaf\\\" on issues such as slavery - described in a paragraph about the \\\"Caribbean experience\\\".And this would not help tap a potential reservoir of support from people from ethnic minority backgrounds who may broadly share conservative values, but don't yet trust the Conservative Party.In his rescinded resignation letter, the now former adviser Sam Kasumu seemed to share those views.White working classBut with Boris Johnson hoping to continue to retain support in the seats he won from Labour in the 2019 election, some of those advising him say it is essential that he is seen to address the disadvantage suffered by those from white working class backgrounds.People in this group might be struggling in education - and in getting into the jobs market - every bit as much as counterparts from ethnic backgrounds.In this respect the report is helpful to the PM, with chairman Tony Sewell writing in the foreword: \\\"Another revelation from our dive into the data was just how stuck some groups from the white majority are.\\\"As a result, we came to the view that recommendations should, wherever possible, be designed to remove obstacles for everyone, rather than specific groups.\\\"And one source told us: \\\"The government is quite happy having these culture debates.\\\"Getting a discussion around this report is what the government was trying to do.\\\"Well, whatever else it has achieved, it has certainly generated that.'Misrepresentation'Following the backlash against the report, the commission has sought to \\\"set the record straight\\\".In a statement released late on Friday, it said: \\\"The facts and analysis we presented challenge a number of strongly held beliefs about the nature and extent of racism in Britain today.\\\"Sadly, however, in some cases fair and robust disagreement with the commission's work has tipped into misrepresentation.\\\"The commission said it had \\\"never said that racism does not exist in society or in institutions\\\".\\\"We say the contrary: racism is real and we must do more to tackle it,\\\" the statement said.\\\"Robust debate we welcome. But to depict us as racism deniers, slavery apologists or worse is unacceptable.\\\"The commission did not \\\"find conclusive evidence\\\" that institutional racism exists in the areas it examined, the statement added, but the report stresses that \\\"both the reality and the perception of unfairness matter\\\".The commission said it hoped the report would be \\\"read carefully and considered in the round\\\".Correction 19th April 2021: A line in this story wrongly described the acronym BAME as referring to black and ethnic minority and has been amended to explain that it refers to black, Asian and minority ethnic."},{"author":"By Lucy Wallis","title":"'We found a baby on the subway - now he's our son' - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/stories-56409764","content":"Danny Stewart was rushing to meet his boyfriend for dinner when he ran past something lying on the floor of a New York subway station. Soon he would treasure it more than anything else in the world.It was around eight o'clock on 28 August 2000, just past the frenzy of the New York rush hour when a subway train rattled down the track into 14th Street station, in the Chelsea district of Manhattan. Danny Stewart, 34, was late for dinner with his partner, Pete Mercurio, 32.The couple had met three years earlier through a friend in Pete's softball team. Later Danny had moved in with Pete and his flatmate, but on this summer evening he had been back to his sublet apartment in Harlem to pick up the post.As Danny was hurrying out of the station something caught his eye.\\\"I noticed on the floor tucked up against the wall, what I thought was a baby doll,\\\" he says.He was puzzled - why would a child leave a doll on the ground? - but he continued up the stairs to the exit.\\\"I glanced back one more time, and that's when I noticed his legs moved.\\\"He ran back down the stairs and realised that the doll was in fact a baby boy, wrapped in a dark sweatshirt, with his tiny legs sticking out.\\\"He didn't have any clothes on, he was just wrapped up in this sweatshirt. His umbilical cord was still partially intact, so I could tell he was a newborn. I was thinking maybe a day or so old,\\\" he says.Danny could hardly believe what he was seeing. He couldn't understand how a baby had been left on the floor, or who could have left it.The little boy was very quiet, and yet also alert, with big, wide eyes.\\\"He did look up and I stroked his head and then he whimpered a little bit. It seemed really unreal, the whole situation, and at that point I was trying to alert people to what was happening, but I couldn't get anybody's attention.\\\"Danny yelled out, \\\"Please, call the police,\\\" but almost everyone ignored him.\\\"I did get the attention of one woman, but she didn't speak English, so she didn't really understand what I was saying, even when I was trying to point to the baby,\\\" Danny says. \\\"I think she probably thought I may have been a little deranged.\\\"This was before the time when everyone had a mobile phone and Danny was afraid to pick up the baby in case he was hurt. So Danny ran up the stairs to the street to a payphone and called 911.\\\"I found a baby,\\\" he blurted out. Then he told the police where he was located and ran back to check the baby was still OK. He waited for what seemed like ages.\\\"I'm sure it was just a few minutes, but time was standing still as my heart was racing,\\\" he says. \\\"I thought, well they probably think this is a prank call and they're probably not believing me, so somebody else needs to call, and that's when I thought of Pete.\\\"Grabbing a quarter out of his pocket he ran back to the payphone to call him.\\\"Once again, I blurted out, 'I found a baby. I don't think the police believe me so call them please right now.'\\\"Pete, who had been pacing up and down, looking out of his apartment window waiting for Danny, says the hair on the back of his neck stood up.\\\"Because Danny doesn't joke, he wouldn't say something if it wasn't true,\\\" he says.He bolted out of the apartment to the subway station, arriving as the police were carrying the baby away to be taken for a check-up at the hospital. After Danny had given his statement, the two of them left.\\\"I remember turning to Danny and saying to him on the sidewalk as the police car was driving away, 'You know, you're going to be connected to that baby in some way for the rest of your life,'\\\" says Pete.\\\"Danny was like, 'What do you mean?' I said, 'Well, eventually, this child is going to learn of the night he was found and he may want to find the person who discovered him. Maybe there's a way that we can find out where he ends up and send a birthday gift every year on this date?'\\\"Find out moreThe next day, news of the baby found on the subway was all over the headlines.\\\"Danny Stewart was the Good Samaritan that found the seven-pound baby,\\\" said one reporter, as Danny was interviewed for TV news.\\\"The baby is Hispanic with patches of brown hair on the top of his head,\\\" said another.Danny wanted to find out how the baby was, and so went to the hospital where he had been taken, but was unable to get any news.So Danny and Pete returned to their daily lives - Danny to his role as a social worker and Pete as a playwright and web designer.But before too long Danny received an invitation from the Administration for Children's Services to attend a family court hearing, to testify how he had found the baby. When this took place, in December 2000, the judge asked Danny if he could stay for the entire hearing. He waited for the police to give their testimony, and then the judge addressed Danny again.\\\"She says, 'Mr Stewart, I want to let you know what's happening here, in instances where we have a baby that has been abandoned, we want to place them in pre-adoptive foster care as quickly as possible.'\\\"In my head, I'm thinking, 'Well that makes sense,'\\\" says Danny. \\\"And then the next thing out of her mouth was, 'Would you be interested in adopting this baby?'\\\"Danny looked around, all eyes were on him.\\\"I think most of the mouths dropped in the courtroom, including mine. I said, 'Yes, but I don't think it's that easy,' and the judge smiled and she said, 'Well, it can be.'\\\"Although the judge's question had come completely out of the blue, friends and acquaintances had already queried why Danny and Pete had not taken the baby boy home to take care of the night he was found. You didn't need to be a social worker, as Danny was, to realise that this wasn't how things worked.The adoption process took six to nine months and involved background checks and parenting training.\\\"I had not had thoughts of adopting,\\\" says Danny, \\\"but at the same time, I could not stop thinking that\\u2026 I did feel connected, I felt like this was not even an opportunity, it was a gift, and how can you say no to this gift.\\\"Outside the courtroom Danny telephoned Pete to tell him the news.\\\"My gut reaction was just to say, 'No - no, you're not, you're not interested. Go back right now into the courtroom and tell her, No, you made a mistake. Just tell her no,'\\\" Pete says.Over the next week they had what Danny says were tense conversations... Pete calls them heated arguments.\\\"I didn't want my life to change. I was happy the way we were and this was just going to change everything,\\\" Pete says.\\\"We had no money, we had no space, we still had a roommate\\u2026 I was also a little angry with him, 'How could you say yes, without consulting me first?'\\\"The situation almost tore them apart.\\\"Danny had said at one point, 'I'm going ahead with this whether you're on board or not,' says Pete, and I just said, 'You're choosing a baby over our relationship?'\\\"He said, 'I would like us to all be a family, I'd like us to do this together, but if you're not ready, I understand and I'm going to do it with or without you.'\\\"Pete remembers saying some \\\"awful things\\\" to Danny such as, \\\"Good luck being a single parent in New York.\\\"Yet despite this, he says, there was a part of him that desperately wanted it to happen.So Danny convinced Pete to come with him and visit the baby at his foster home.When they arrived they said they noticed very quickly it was not an ideal place for him to be. He had painfully sore and infected nappy rash from his belly button all around his hips and thighs to his back.The caseworker who was with them sat down with the foster mother and pushed the baby seat with the little boy in it towards Danny and Pete. The baby stared at them with wide eyes. Danny noticed he was not blinking and was very quiet.Holding the baby in his arms for the first time, Danny gently said, \\\"Remember me?\\\"When it was Pete's turn to hold the baby, an \\\"instant wave of warmth\\\" came over him, he says.\\\"The baby squeezed my finger with his entire hand so hard,\\\" says Pete. \\\"He was just staring up at me and I was just looking at him, and it was almost like he found a pressure point in my finger that just opened up my heart to my head and showed me in that moment that I could be one of his parents, one of his dads.\\\"After that, the adoption process began quickly. There were home visits, background checks and lots of questions to answer. Danny and Pete were told it would take months for the baby to be placed in their home, so they would have lots of time to prepare.But they had to attend a court hearing on 20 December to state their intention to adopt the baby. The same judge was presiding, and she glanced down at the calendar on her desk.\\\"She looks back up at us and she says, 'How would you like him for the holiday?'\\\" says Pete. \\\"I think we both nodded, yes, but internally, I'm thinking, 'What holiday? I hope she's not meaning Christmas, because that's in a couple of days.'\\\"But that was what she meant and she started issuing orders to the caseworker and the attorneys to have the baby ready to pick up from the foster care agency in two days.Back at home Pete called his family for help.He'd already told them about their adoption plans, and got their full support.\\\"I said we're going to name him Kevin, and my mum just started bawling, because she had had a baby before me that died on birth, and they were naming that baby Kevin,\\\" says Pete.\\\"So this was just sort of a weird way of their baby Kevin coming back to them again as a grandchild from their gay son.\\\"With only two days to prepare, everyone was in a frantic rush. Pete's family went to the shops to buy all the supplies the couple needed. Danny and Pete started speed reading baby books such as What to Expect When You're Expecting. Their apartment was turned into a nursery with boxes of nappies everywhere and a cot.On Friday 22 December at nine o'clock in the morning, Danny and Pete collected Kevin from the foster care agency. They snuggled him up in his blanket and - appropriately - took the subway back to their apartment.\\\"It had started to snow,\\\" says Danny, \\\"so it made it feel even more magical.\\\"Alone that evening as a family, they had a chance to take in everything that had happened.\\\"I think we exhaled probably for the first time,\\\" says Danny. \\\"I remember just kind of marvelling in the moment that this was actually a reality.\\\"Kevin lay fast asleep on Pete's chest, drooling.The judge's plan had been for Kevin to visit for the Christmas holidays and then return to his foster home. But Danny and Pete asked if there was any way he could stay with them, and on 27 December, the case worker called with good news, Kevin could remain while they completed the home study and certified their home.The Manhattan Family Court was located near Ground Zero, where the 9\\\/11 attacks took place in September 2001, so the adoption process was delayed, but it was finally completed on 17 December 2002.Danny, Pete and Kevin soon settled into family life together. Danny remembers how Kevin loved books. Every night they would read bedtime stories or sing him to sleep while stroking his head.Pete made a picture book with the story of Kevin's discovery, which he decorated with clip art, and when Kevin was three or four, he and Danny would read it to him every night before bedtime.\\\"It was his favourite,\\\" says Pete.\\\"Some nights, and days, we read it multiple times. We'd often catch Kevin flipping through the pages by himself and mouthing the words he had memorised. This was the sweetest thing in the world to witness.\\\"Kevin didn't make the connection for almost a year that this was his story, Pete says. But when he did, he was so proud and excited that he took the book for a show and tell at his school.Kevin was also curious about who his biological family might be.\\\"He would, every now and then, if we were out, look at people on the sidewalk that were passing us by, or if we were at a restaurant, he would point out, 'That woman over there has the same skin colour as me,'\\\" says Pete. \\\"But he never stressed about it and then it just sort of went away. He never really brought it up much.\\\"When Kevin was 10, he was on his way to school when \\\"papa Pete\\\" turned to ask him what he thought about an idea he and \\\"daddy Danny\\\" had been discussing the night before.It was 2011 and New York had become the sixth state in the US to legalise gay marriage. Although Danny says he and Pete already felt married \\\"by default\\\", this would just make it official.Kevin was excited about the idea and turned to his papa to ask him, \\\"Don't judges marry people?\\\"It was an inspired idea, so Pete sent an email to Manhattan Family Court to ask if the same judge - Judge Cooper - would officiate at their marriage. Within two hours they got a reply, she would be delighted.At their first meeting, she explained that she had been involved in a short-lived pilot project placing babies who had been abandoned into pre-adoptive foster care, and that she'd had the authority to \\\"expedite that process\\\".\\\"She also said that all babies needed a connection to somebody. And so when Danny was testifying in the courtroom about finding the baby, in her mind his most serious connection in the world was to Danny, so why not just ask him?\\\" Pete says. \\\"It was almost as simple as that. She saw a connection that was already made, and had a hunch that it would be the right connection.\\\"Her hunch had been correct, as she could see for herself when she met Kevin at the marriage ceremony.Danny says it was an occasion that left him overcome with emotion, happiness and amazement.\\\"This woman, the very reason we're a family, is once again, the very reason we're getting married. It was like coming full circle,\\\" he says.Kevin is now 20 years old, and at college studying mathematics and computer science. The tiny baby boy whom Danny discovered on the subway station is now over six feet tall, and taller than his dads.He loves playing ultimate frisbee, has run numerous marathons and danced with the National Dance Institute from the age of nine to 14. Pete says when Kevin wants to learn something, he just goes out and does it, and has taught himself piano and guitar.\\\"Kevin's always been a respectful kid,\\\" says Pete. \\\"He's empathic and kind. He keeps his emotions close to the vest. He's an observer, doesn't crave or seek attention. He's a private person, but also a quiet leader.\\\"He can also be very funny, Pete says.The family love visiting the national parks together, taking part in outdoor activities such as kayaking and supporting their favourite baseball team, the New York Mets.\\\"I can't imagine my life if it didn't turn out this way,\\\" says Danny, now aged 55. \\\"My life has become much more enriched and full. It has changed my world view, my perspective, my whole lens.\\\"Just as it was inconceivable 20 years ago to think about becoming parents, it is even more inconceivable says Pete, now 52, to think about not being parents.\\\"I did not know that this level of deep love existed in the world until my son came into my life.\\\"Pete has written a children's book about their family's story called Our Subway BabyJudge Cooper is a pseudonym Pete uses in his book as she does not want to be namedYou may also be interested in:George is one of tens of thousands of children in the UK who've been taken into care because their parents are unable to look after them.

From January onwards, India had begun shipping doses to foreign countries as part of its much-vaunted \\\"vaccine diplomacy\\\".Mr Vardhan's unbridled optimism was based on a sharp drop in reported infections. Since a peak of more than 93,000 cases per day on average in mid-September, infections had steadily declined. By mid-February, India was counting an average of 11,000 cases a day. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths from the disease had slid to below 100.The euphoria at beating the virus had been building since late last year. Politicians, policy makers and parts of the media believed that India was truly out of the woods. In December, central bank officials announced that India was \\\"bending the Covid infection curve\\\". There was evidence, they said, in poetic terms, that the economy was \\\"breaking out amidst winter's lengthening shadows towards a place in sunlight\\\". Mr Modi was called a \\\"vaccine guru\\\".At the end of February, India's election authorities announced key elections in five states where 186 million people were eligible to vote for 824 seats. Beginning 27 March, the polls would stretch over a month, and in the case of the state of West Bengal, be held in eight phases. Campaigning had begun in full swing, with no safety protocols and social distancing. In mid-March, the cricket board allowed more than 130,000 fans, mostly unmasked, to watch two international cricket games between India and England at the Narendra Modi stadium in Gujarat.In less than a month, things began to unravel. India was in the grips of a devastating second wave of the virus and cities were facing fresh lockdowns. By mid-April, the country was averaging more than 100,000 cases a day. On Sunday, India recorded more than 270,000 cases and over 1,600 deaths, both new single-day records. If the runway infection was not checked, India could be recording more than 2,300 deaths every day by first week of June, according to a report by The Lancet Covid-19 Commission.India is in now in the grips of a public health emergency. Social media feeds are full with videos of Covid funerals at crowded cemeteries, wailing relatives of the dead outside hospitals, long queues of ambulances carrying gasping patients, mortuaries overflowing with the dead, and patients, sometimes two to a bed, in corridors and lobbies of hospitals. There are frantic calls for help for beds, medicines, oxygen, essential drugs and tests. Drugs are being sold on the black market, and test results are taking days. \\\"They didn't tell me for three hours that my child is dead,\\\" a dazed mother says in one video, sitting outside an ICU. Wails of another person outside the intensive care punctuate the silences.Even India's mammoth vaccination effort was now struggling. In the beginning, the rollout had been embroiled in a controversy over the efficacy over a home-grown candidate. Even as the country ramped up the drive and administered more than 100 million doses by last week, vaccine shortages were being reported. Serum Institute of India, the country's - and the world's - biggest vaccine maker said it would not be able to ramp up supplies before June because it didn't have enough money to expand capacity. India placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, because the doses were needed urgently at home, and allowed imports of foreign vaccines. Even oxygen was likely to be imported now to meet the surge in demand.Meanwhile, almost in a parallel universe, away from the death and despair, the world's richest cricket tournament was being played behind closed doors every evening, and tens of thousands of people were following their leaders to election rallies and attending the Hindu festival of Kumbh Mela. \\\"It is beyond surreal, what is happening,\\\" Shiv Visvanathan, a sociology professor, told me.Experts believe the government appears to have completely dropped the ball on the second wave of infections that was about to hit India.In mid-February, Tabassum Barnagarwala, a journalist with the Indian Express newspaper, flagged a seven-fold rise in new cases in parts of Maharashtra and reported that samples from the infected had been sent for genome sequencing to look for imported variants.By the end of the month, the BBC reported the surge and asked whether India was facing a new Covid wave. \\\"We really don't know what the cause of the surge is. What is worrying is that entire families are getting infected. This is a completely new trend,\\\" Dr Shyamsunder Nikam, civil surgeon of an affected district in Maharashtra, said at the time.Experts now say that crowing about India's exceptionalism in \\\"beating\\\" the epidemic - younger population, native immunity, a largely rural population - and declaring victory on the virus turned out to be cruelly premature. \\\"As is typical in India, official arrogance, hyper-nationalism, populism and an ample dose of bureaucratic incompetence have combined to create a crisis,\\\" said Mihir Sharma, a columnist for Bloomberg.India's second wave was fuelled by people letting their guard down, attending weddings and social gatherings, and by mixed messaging from the government, allowing political rallies and religious gatherings. With infections declining, fewer people were taking the jabs, slowing down the vaccination drive, which had aimed to inoculate 250 million people by the end of July. In mid-February, Bhramar Mukherjee, a biostatistician at the University of Michigan, tweeted that India needed to \\\"accelerate the vaccination drive while the case counts are low\\\". Nobody quite took notice.\\\"There was a feeling of triumphalism,\\\" said P Srinath Reddy, the president of the Public Health Foundation of India. \\\"Some felt we had achieved herd immunity. Everyone wanted to get back to work. This narrative fell on many receptive ears, and the few voices of caution were not heeded to,\\\" he said.A second wave may have been inevitable, but India could have \\\"postponed or delayed it and lessened its impact,\\\" said Gautam Menon, a professor of physics and biology. Like many other countries, India should have begun careful genomic surveillance in January to detect variants, Mr Menon said. Some of these variants could be driving the surge. \\\"We learnt of new variants in February from reports from Maharashtra. This was initially denied by authorities,\\\" Mr Menon added. \\\"This was a significant turning point.\\\"What are the lessons of this public health crisis? For one, India should learn not to declare victory over the virus prematurely, and it should put a lid on triumphalism. People should also learn to adapt to short, local lockdowns in the event of the inevitable future spikes of infection. Most epidemiologists predict more waves, given that India is evidently still far away from reaching herd immunity and its vaccination rate remains slow.\\\"We cant freeze human life,\\\" Professor Reddy said. \\\"If we can't physically distance in the crowded cities, we can at least make sure everyone wears a proper mask. And wear it properly. That's not a big ask.\\\""},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Covid-19 vaccines: What's happening to unused jabs? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-56763490","content":"While some countries are scrambling to get their hands on vaccines, others are left wondering what to do with jabs they've ordered but can no longer use, following concerns over safety.Several countries have restricted use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca (AZ) and Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccines for younger age groups because of a very small risk of rare blood clots.Denmark has stopped giving out AZ altogether, triggering a wave of interest in its unused doses.In a bold move, the Czech Republic offered to buy \\\"all AstraZeneca vaccines from Denmark\\\". Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania also expressed interest.Why is this happening?There are growing concerns about rare - and sometimes fatal - cases of blood clots, especially in younger people. But health regulators worldwide point out the risk from Covid-19 is far greater.Based on figures from the UK medicines regulator, if 10 million imaginary people were given the AZ vaccine, you might expect to see 40 of these clots. About 10 people would die - a one-in-a-million chance.That's roughly the same risk as being murdered in the next month or - if you get in a car and drive for 250 miles - the risk of dying in a road accident on that journey.Nevertheless, the Danish health authority made the decision to discontinue use of the AZ jab. It said it had other vaccines available, the epidemic was under control there and it was acting out of caution in response to a \\\"known risk of severe adverse effects\\\".The decision meant that the 2.4 million doses of unused AZ Denmark had agreed to buy would be withdrawn.A link between the J&J vaccine and rare blood clots is also being investigated. Until safety checks are completed, these vaccines will remain unused in the US, which had ordered 100 million doses.J&J has also been suspended in South Africa, where it had been the vaccine of choice after studies showed it gave higher protection against a local Covid-19 variant.AZ, which is less effective against the variant, had previously fallen out of favour in South Africa, resulting in - that's right - unused vaccines.To stop them going to waste, South Africa sold a million AZ doses for distribution in 14 fellow African nations.Can these vaccines be used elsewhere?In theory, yes. Countries are keen to either sell or donate vaccines they no longer need.On Thursday, the Europe director of the World Health Organization (WHO), Hans Kluge, suggested Denmark was seeking to do just that.\\\"I understand that the ministry of foreign affairs of Denmark is ready to, or looking already into options, for sharing AstraZeneca vaccines with poorer countries,\\\" Mr Kluge told a briefing.And some of Denmark's neighbours offered to snap up the unwanted supplies.\\\"We still have less vaccines than people willing to be vaccinated,\\\" Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said. \\\"Therefore, Lithuania has expressed readiness to take as many doses of AstraZeneca, as Denmark is ready to share.\\\"In a tweet, Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamacek said he had instructed a diplomat to declare the country's interest in \\\"purchasing all AstraZeneca vaccines from Denmark\\\".Denmark's response is not yet clear - its government has yet to comment.In the meantime, those vaccines will be preserved in storage. Both the AZ and J&J vaccines have the advantage that they can be stored at fridge temperature, making them easier to transport than the Pfizer jab, which must be stored at -70 degrees.That said, vaccines do have a use-by date, which varies depending on the jab's developer.How many vaccines are unused?There's no global record but regional data provides a snapshot. Denmark, for example, had received 202,920 doses of AZ as of 15 April, figures from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDP) show.Of those, 150,671 doses were administered, leaving 52,249 doses unused.The picture is similar across Europe, where a number of countries have limited the AZ and J&J vaccines to older people.Data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows many states have a surplus.More than 20% of vaccines delivered have not yet been administered, in states including Alabama (37%), Alaska (35%), Vermont (27%), and North Carolina (24%).Meanwhile West Virginia, which was using almost all of its allocation, is now seeing more than a quarter of its doses going unused - an average of 350,000 going spare every day, according to Bloomberg.Health experts say the unused capacity suggests some areas may be running out of residents willing to get vaccinated.Is there a scheme for sharing spare vaccines?Yes, there is. It's called Covax.It is an international scheme that aims to ensure vaccines are shared fairly among all nations, rich and poor. It is led by the WHO and involves the Global Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi).By the end of 2021, Covax hopes to deliver more than two billion doses to people in 190 countries.Part of this scheme involves redistributing donations of spare vaccines from rich countries to poor ones.For example, the UK, which has ordered around 450 million doses, has committed to donating most of its \\\"surplus\\\" supply to poorer countries. Other wealthier countries have made gestures of solidarity with poorer ones.Yet they have faced criticism because, up to now, none have explained exactly when they will have spare doses and how many they intend to donate.For the time being at least, rich countries are focusing on vaccinating their own populations, while providing funding for the Covax programme.How and when might these spare vaccines be shared?Put simply, we don't know yet.The BBC did ask Gavi if it had a record of how many spare vaccines countries have pledged to Covax - this was its response:\\\"Given the limited supply environment in the near term, doses donated from countries with excess supply, and equitably allocated through the Covax Facility will be an important part of the solution for getting rapid, equitable access globally. We are talking to a number of higher income economies about sharing their surplus doses and expect to announce our first agreements soon.\\\"So agreements to share spare vaccines are in the pipeline but - frustratingly for many - there's no concrete information yet on who is getting what.More on fair access to vaccines:"},{"author":"Dave Luis Dr Sindisiwe van Zyl","title":"Sindi van Zyl: The 'people's doctor' who revealed her own struggles - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-africa-56764908","content":"South Africans are mourning the woman who became known as \\\"the people's doctor\\\", after she died at the age of 45 from Covid-19-related complications.

She asked him if he would talk to a patient of hers about addiction.\\\"She made time for everyone, even weirdos like me, sitting 8,000km away in the desert,\\\" he says of someone who ended up becoming a friend.'Liker of things fabulous'From learning how to be a DJ, to hosting her weekly talk show Sidebar with Sindi on Johannesburg station Kaya FM, at the centre of Dr Van Zyl's life was her commitment to her patients and her love for her family.\\\"She relished all her roles - daughter, friend, researcher, sister, aunt, cousin, doctor, speaker, entrepreneur, student, social butterfly, perfumista, deejay and chief liker of things fabulous - but truly, she was in her element as a mother and wife,\\\" Kaya FM said in its tribute to her.Dr Van Zyl's two children, Nandi and Manie, regularly made appearances on her Twitter timeline.She was open about suffering from postnatal depression but she used that experience to help mothers who reached out to her.The death of her own mother affected her deeply and she often talked about how she got professional help. Of the thousands of stories shared in the days following her death, so many recounted how she counselled them through their depression.At an awards ceremony three years ago, Dr Van Zyl explained that her approach to medicine came from an experience that she had aged 19.She did not explain why she was being treated but said that doctors and nurses had decided \\\"they were not going to save my life\\\".\\\"I decided then that when I become a medical doctor, I don't want anyone to be in a situation where they are helpless and they don't know what to do.\\\"When you are sick, you are very vulnerable.

She says she could never understand where the doctor found the time to interact with so many people.She had a busy life but she did not publicise all the work she did, from donating to causes to helping patients with money for a taxi, according to Ms Fortune.She explains her friend's drive as being a result of her own mental health struggles.\\\"She went through a period in her life where she went through depression and it took her a long time to come out of it. And when she came out of it, she wanted to do absolutely everything,\\\" she told the BBC.Her colleague, Dr Cephas Chikanda, said he and others have learned so much from the way she practised medicine.\\\"She wanted to hear your story and she also shared her stories. She was generous in sharing information,\\\" he told a service in Johannesburg on Thursday.Dr Van Zyl contracted Covid-19 in February and spent several weeks in the intensive care unit. The last two months of her life were spent in a local hospital.'Love like Sindi did'Speaking during her memorial service on Thursday, her husband, Marinus van Zyl, recalled that one of the nurses in the ward where she was treated asked: \\\"What makes Sindi so special?\\\"His answer was her ability to love people, many people. And he challenged everyone to \\\"'love like Sindi did\\\".Her two young children also paid tribute to their mother. Her son Manie, 10, while wiping tears from his cheeks, described her as a good person. \\\"But all good things need to come to an end\\\", he said with remarkable composure and maturity.While her daughter, Nandi, 13, remembered how her mother made all her patients feel like family.In her last few days she was still referring her patients to other doctors so they would get the help they needed.You may also be interested in:A memorial page dedicated to Dr Van Zyl has thousands of entries - from friends, to students, to strangers - all touched in some way by her apparently boundless energy.Zimkita Makwetu said that she was helped when she \\\"was at the brink of ending my life, at a very very dark phase\\\".\\\"I have had immense support, direct access to her and the faith and belief that I too would overcome depression and look back at the lessons in awe.\\\"While Faith Mamphoka called her a beautiful spirit: \\\"Always kind, always ready to make you smile.

Cases had been below 20,000 a day for much of January and February - a low figure in a country of more than a 1.3 billion people.But then infections began to rise rapidly: Saturday saw a record set for the third day in a row, with more than 234,000 cases reported.Hospitals are running low on beds and oxygen. Sick people are being turned away, and some families are turning to the black market to get the drugs they need. A BBC investigation found medication being offered at five times the official price.The capital Delhi has gone into lockdown over the weekend, with restrictions put in place in several other states, as officials try to stem the tide.All eyes are now on the Kumbh Mela festival, which has continued despite fears the millions of Hindu devotees who attend each year could bring the virus home with them. Some 1,600 people tested positive this week at the gathering in the northern state of Uttrakhand, with pictures showing thousands gathered closely together along the banks of the Ganges river.It has led Prime Minister Narendra Modi to plead with people to refrain from gathering.Where else are cases rising?Brazil - which has recorded the third highest number of cases and, at 368,749, the second highest number of deaths - is still struggling to control the outbreak.On Friday, the health ministry announced more than 85,000 new cases over the previous 24 hours and 3,305 deaths.Canada has also reported a recent rise, registering more cases per million than the US over the last week - the first time this has happened since the pandemic began.Papua New Guinea has also been highlighted as a cause for concern. The World Health Organization head, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, noted \\\"the potential for a much larger epidemic\\\" in the Pacific nation following a sharp increase in cases.He added that the country - which has received 140,000 vaccine doses through Australia and the Covax scheme - is a \\\"perfect example of why vaccine equity is so important\\\".How is vaccination going globally?More than 860 million doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in 165 countries worldwide.However, Dr Tedros told UN officials on Friday: \\\"Vaccine equity is the challenge of our time - and we are failing.\\\"Some countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population.Those with high vaccinations rates, such as the UK and Israel, have seen their numbers of new infections drop sharply. Scientists at Imperial College London say the UK's vaccine rollout could be \\\"breaking the link\\\" between infections, deaths and hospital admissions.A leading Israeli doctor said this week he believed Israel - where more than half the population has been vaccinated - may be close to reaching \\\"herd immunity\\\".While Israel has distributed 119 doses per 100 people, just 2.81 doses per 100 have been given in the Palestinian territories, recent data from Our World in Data at Oxford University showed.But many more countries are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive.That is leading to warnings about growing \\\"vaccine inequity\\\" - jabs not being being shared fairly between rich and poorer countries.Dr Tedros pointed out that in high-income countries, one in four people have received a vaccine, compared with only one in 400 in poorer countries.The WHO is working on a global scheme, Covax, to get rich countries to share their jabs with lower income countries. Covax plans to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year, but many vaccines require two doses per person.Scientists are also worried about how effective the current jabs will be against fast-spreading new variants of the disease.Research is ongoing into updated jabs that work against the variants and some countries are considering whether booster shots will be needed.Experts are closely studying them to understand if vaccines may need to be updated to be more effective. Some countries are considering whether booster shots will be needed.Professor Adam Finn, a member of the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said he expected a \\\"gradual erosion\\\" of vaccine protection as the virus evolves, but immunity from vaccines \\\"won't just disappear\\\"."},{"author":"By Kevin Connolly Stella Kyriakides Jens Spahn","title":"Sputnik V: How Russia's Covid vaccine is dividing Europe - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-56735931","content":"It's no coincidence that Russia has christened its Covid vaccine Sputnik V. The first time the world learned the meaning of the Russian word Sputnik was in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched the first man-made satellite into orbit.At the height of the Cold War this startling evidence of Moscow's scientific and technical capabilities came as a huge shock to Western powers, which had assumed they enjoyed a comfortable technological lead over the Soviets.Critics of the Putin administration were sceptical when the vaccine was given regulatory approval in Moscow as early as last August.That scepticism, though, has faded. Because once again Russian scientists have surprised the West.A Russian 'tool of soft power'An Eastern European diplomat, from a country that regards Russia as a clear and present threat, put it to me like this: \\\"The search for vaccines in 2020 was rather similar to the race for space flight in the 1950s. Once again many outsiders have underestimated Russia. This is potentially the most powerful tool of soft power that Moscow has had in its hands for generations.\\\"That word \\\"potentially\\\" is important here.Sputnik V has not yet been approved by the EU's European Medicines Agency. But it's already been ordered by many different countries from Argentina and Mexico to Israel and the Philippines, and Russian officials say they have signed deals to produce it in South Korea and India.There has been the odd hiccup in the rollout.Argentinian President Alberto Fernández tested positive for Covid-19 in April after receiving two doses of Sputnik in January and February. That's a reminder that even if the Gamaleya Institute's claimed efficacy rate of 91.6% turns out to be true, a small statistical risk remains among those who've been vaccinated.In Europe, though, the Sputnik vaccine has created problems that are more political than epidemiological.The EU struggles to speak with a single, convincing voice on Russia.That's partly a matter of history and geography. Lithuania and Poland are naturally more likely to consider Russia a threat than are, say, Portugal and Malta.And there's also the perennial problem of balancing the EU's status as an importer of Russian gas with the EU's desire to punish Russia over issues like the attempted murder of leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny or the military build-up on the border of Ukraine.Adding European reliance on Russia for vaccine supplies into that mix is going to make the relationship harder than ever to balance.And yet Europe, or at least parts of Europe, are beginning to turn to Moscow out of frustration at the EU's painfully slow vaccine rollout.'You have to think of your own interests'Hungary has already bought and distributed considerable quantities of Sputnik V. France and Germany, among many others, are at least prepared to consider it, if and when the European Medicines Agency gives its approval. Hungary has used its right as an independent member state to grant emergency authorisation.Veteran French diplomat Pierre Vimont, who's now a senior fellow at Carnegie Europe, says it's perfectly rational for member states to think about buying Sputnik.\\\"Even when you're facing an adversary,\\\" he told the BBC, \\\"you have to think of your own interests.\\\"Mr Vimont, as you'd expect of a man who's held some of his country's most important diplomatic postings, suggests that the European Union's attitude should be one of cautious pragmatism. That means acknowledging the excellence of Russian science but waiting for EMA authorisation as well.He makes the point that countries using the jab on the basis of their own approval could face political difficulties with their own voters if things go wrong.How Sputnik row brought down a prime ministerThe case of Slovakia offers a salutary warning to others.Its Prime Minister, Igor Matovic, secretly arranged to import 200,000 doses of the Russian vaccine. He was forced to leave his post late last month because he'd failed to consult his coalition partners.Then Slovak scientists claimed the doses sent to Bratislava were different to samples of the vaccine sent elsewhere, prompting the Russians to denounce the claim as fake news and demand the return of the shipment. An offer from Hungary to approve the doses on Slovakia's behalf added a further layer of complexity.Russia normally has to spend huge amounts of money on computer hacking and disinformation to spread discord and uncertainty in Europe. Now the vaccine appears to be achieving something similar without any effort.Pierre Vimont of Carnegie says the Putin administration will be pleased. \\\"I'm sure they are enjoying this,\\\" he said, \\\"let's not be fooled. The use of vaccines by Russia and by China is a diplomatic instrument, a tool for soft power. Playing {EU} member states off against each other is naturally important to Russia.\\\"A notable victory for RussiaThere was a similar reaction from our Eastern European diplomat, who fears that European actions over cases like the poisoning of Alexei Navalny are generally too weak.\\\"What the vaccines episode shows,\\\" he told me, \\\"is that we are quite capable of tying ourselves in knots over our dealings with Moscow without any help from the Russians.\\\"There is a long way to run with all of this.Russia still has a lot to do to increase production of its vaccine even as it boldly takes orders all over the world. This week it announced it was starting production of the drug in Serbia, the first European country outside Russia and Belarus.It may also be planning to license production in Western Europe as well as India. But there's still the need for EMA authorisation: will the Russian data and the way it was collected meet EU standards?But for now there is no doubt that Russia has scored a notable scientific and political victory.The original Sputnik changed the world. Sputnik V may not represent an achievement on quite that scale but it is certainly helping to change the way Russia is perceived.More on Russia's early success in the space race"},{"author":"By Jane Chambers","title":"Chile sees Covid surge despite vaccination success - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-latin-america-56731801","content":"Chile's Health Minister Enrique Paris has been striking a gloomy note at his daily Covid news conferences in recent days.The number of daily cases reached a new record high on 9 April, going over 9,000 for the first time since the pandemic began and considerably higher than the previous peak of just under 7,000 cases in mid-June.\\\"It's worrying,\\\" he said last Friday. \\\"We're going through a critical moment of the pandemic\\u2026 I urge you to take care of yourselves, of your loved ones, of your families.\\\"Intensive care units are again overwhelmed, the country has for a second time closed its borders to everyone who is not a resident and most of its 18 million inhabitants are back in lockdown.\\\"It feels like we're going backwards,\\\" says Santiago resident Sofía Pinto. \\\"We need to download special permits online to be allowed out just twice a week for essential things like food shopping or doctor's visits.\\\"The frustration and confusion many Chileans are feeling over the renewed lockdown is due partly to the fact that just two months ago, President Sebastián Piñera was boasting about Chile having one of the fastest vaccination rollouts in the world.What went wrong?Critics have accused the Piñera government of getting caught up in triumphalism over the vaccine rollout and of having loosened coronavirus restrictions too fast.Like governments across the world, ministers here faced difficult choices.Chile's borders had been closed - bar for a few exceptions - from March to November 2020. But after a strict lockdown had driven the rolling seven-day average down to 1,300 cases in November, the decision was taken to reopen them, including to international tourists.Chileans were also given special holiday permits to travel more freely around the country during the southern hemisphere summer holidays after some experts argued it was important for people's mental health.Restaurants, shops, and holiday resorts were opened up to kickstart the faltering economy.Fast, but not in time for the holidaysAnd while the vaccination rollout has indeed been fast, it only started in late December, with front-line health care workers, those over 90, and teachers first in line.So the vast majority of Chileans would not yet have been vaccinated by the time they met up with relatives and friends for their summer holidays in January and February.Add to that the spread of new, more easily transmittable variants of the virus such as the P.1 variant, which is thought to have emerged in Brazil's Amazonas state in November.Dr Susan Bueno, a professor of immunology from the Pontifical Catholic University, says the recent surge is \\\"a multi-factor issue\\\", but that she thinks the new variants are having a \\\"huge impact\\\".She says the message about how to prevent contagion, such as wearing masks and washing your hands, was also somewhat neglected during the summer months in Chile. That, she explains, \\\"is probably one of the causes of the outbreaks we are seeing now\\\".CoronaVac confusionThere is also confusion about how the vaccine that the vast majority in the country has received works, Prof Bueno adds. More than 93% of the doses administered in Chile so far have been CoronaVac, produced by the Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company Sinovac.Data on the efficacy of the CoronaVac vaccine is varied. Brazilian trials suggested an efficacy rate of around 50.4% but results from late-stage trials in Indonesia and Turkey suggested a much higher rate - between 65% and 83%.A study published by the University of Chile last week (in Spanish) looked at the level of protection the vaccine offered after the first and the second doses.It suggested CoronaVac was 56.5% effective in protecting people against infection two weeks after they had received their second dose, but the figure was only 3% in the timespan between the first and second doses.This may give a key clue as to why cases may still be on the rise in Chile, where more than 7.6 million people have received the first jab, but the number of those who have had both the first and second doses is much lower.At a news conference presenting the findings, University of Chile's rector, Ennio Vivaldi, went as far as saying that the first dose of CoronaVac on its own did not have \\\"any relevant effect\\\".Second dose is keyProf Bueno, who is the scientific director of the clinical trial for CoronaVac vaccines in Chile, says complying with the full vaccination schedule is therefore paramount. \\\"Just one dose doesn't give you the whole preventive response,\\\" she explains.It is a message that María González thinks the government has not done enough to get across. The Santiago resident has just received her first jab at a vaccination centre.\\\"Two jabs are needed before the vaccine works properly,\\\" she says as she waits outside the clinic to make sure she does not have an allergic reaction. \\\"And even then, we still need to be careful, follow social distancing and other safety measures.\\\"Some Chileans are worried about the efficacy of the CoronaVac.Gonzalo Sir is one of them. He has come to one of the few vaccination centres in the capital that offers the Pfizer vaccine.\\\"I want that one [the Pfizer vaccine] because I hear it is more effective and I need it because I travel for my work and Pfizer is more widely recognised,\\\" he says.But Prof Bueno, who analyses scientific data from trials with the CoronaVac, is adamant that the data shows that it works.She says in the trial that showed an efficacy rate of around 50% many of those who got infected only had very mild symptoms or were asymptomatic. She stresses that the important thing is that no-one in the trial needed to go into intensive care.She insists CoronaVac prevents deaths and severe illness and is also proving effective against the Brazilian variant.In response to the spike in cases, the government has not only ordered a strict lockdown but is also providing the latest information about its vaccination campaign on a website inspired by the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.And as the counter on the website ticks upwards as a growing number of Chileans get vaccinated, the message about the importance of getting vaccinated also seems to be filtering through.\\\"It's vital that we get the vaccine and I don't care which one I get,\\\" says Verónica Perez, who recently got the CoronaVac. \\\"All of them help save lives.\\\"You may also be interested in"},{"author":"By Vikas Pandey","title":"India coronavirus: Desperate Covid-19 patients turn to black market for drugs - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-india-56757405","content":"Akhilesh Mishra started getting a fever and a cough last Thursday but he initially thought it was just the flu.Akhilesh began to worry the next day, when his father Yogendra developed similar symptoms. The two men decided to get Covid RT-PCR tests done and tried to book a slot online but the next available appointment was three days later.They finally managed to get a slot on Sunday. In the meantime, Yogendra was running a very high fever and his doctor advised him to look for a hospital bed, which turned out to be another daunting task. They were turned away by many private hospitals in the city of Noida and also in the capital, Delhi.The family finally managed to get a bed for him in a private hospital in Delhi and he is now recovering.Akhilesh had thought he would lose his father.\\\"I felt depressed,\\\" he said. \\\"I feared that he was going to die without getting treatment. No son should have to go through what I went through. Everybody should have equal access to care.\\\"The family's story is not unique. Accounts of family members struggling to find a bed, or life-saving drugs or oxygen cylinders, are being reported all over India. In some cities, there is a long waiting list at the crematoriums.People also have to wait for several hours to get tested for Covid-19 at labs in many cities, including Delhi. And results are coming after 48-72 hours.\\\"I have had symptoms for three days and it's making me anxious that I have to wait for 2-3 days to get a report,\\\" a 35-year-old man said outside a lab in Noida.Black-marketing of drugsIn recent days in India, social media has been awash with desperate requests for help finding the drugs remdesivir and tocilizumab. The effectiveness of the two drugs is being debated across the world but some countries, including India, have given emergency use authorisation to both.The antiviral drug remdesivir is being prescribed by doctors across the country, and it is in high demand. India has banned exports, but manufacturers are still struggling to meet the demand. India has been reporting more than 100,000 cases daily since 6 April.Hetero Pharma, one of seven firms manufacturing remdesivir in India, said the company was trying to ramp up production. The BBC has found that the shortage in supply is leading to black marketing of the drug in Delhi and several other cities. At least three agents contacted by the BBC in Delhi agreed to supply each 100mg vial of remdesivir for 24,000 rupees ($320; £232) - five times the official price. India's health ministry recommends six doses of 100mg vials for a patient for one course of the drug, but doctors say up to eight doses are needed in some cases.That is a lot of money for a middle-class family. \\\"I had to spend so much money to get the drug, said Atul Garg, whose mother was admitted to a private hospital in Delhi. Finding the drug required \\\"hundreds of calls and many anxious hours\\\", Atul said.Tocilizumab, a drug normally used to treat arthritis, has been proven to save lives in some clinical trials. But it has almost disappeared from the market in India.Rajiv Singhal, general secretary of the All India Chemists and Druggists Association, said his phone was ringing through the day as people asked him to help find the drugs.\\\"The situation is so bad that I can't even get the drugs for my own family members,\\\" he said. \\\"We are trying to take action against those who are black marketing, but I admit that there are leakages in the system.\\\"Oxygen, X-rays and Covid testsThe demand for medical oxygen has also soared in several Indian sates. Several hospitals are turning patients away because they lack supplies. Maharashtra state Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray asked the federal government to send oxygen by army aircraft, as road transportation was taking too long to replenish the supply in hospitals.The situation is much worse in small cities and towns. When patients are not able to find a hospital bed, doctors advise them to arrange oxygen cylinders at home.Nabeel Ahmed's father was diagnosed with Covid on Friday in a small town in northern India. Five days later, he started having difficulty in breathing.The doctor advised Nabeel to get an oxygen cylinder at home. He had to drive for four hours to another city to pick one up. \\\"It took me eight hours to get a cylinder for my dad while he was struggling to breathe,\\\" he said.Another major problem patients are facing in smaller towns is that private labs are refusing to conduct chest X-rays and CT scans. Doctors often ask for these tests to assess the progress of the disease.Yogesh Kumar, who lives in the northern town of Allahabad, said the only way for him to get an X-ray done was to either get admitted to a hospital or to get the test done at a government-run hospital, where the waiting list was too long.A doctor in Allahabad told the BBC: \\\"It's unbelievable that I am unable to get X-rays done for my patients. We have to just rely on blood reports to assess the disease in some cases, which is not ideal.\\\"Busy crematoriumsCrematoriums in many badly affected cities are running day and night. In some cases, families have to wait for several hours to cremate the deceased. A recent report said that the metal structure of the furnaces inside a crematorium in the western Indian city of Surat had started melting because it had been running day and night without any break.A short video clip went viral recently showing dozens of funeral pyres burning in the northern city of Lucknow in the middle of the night.Many staff members at crematoriums are working without a break. They are getting exhausted. Many around India are asking if these situations were avoidable.\\\"We did not learn lessons from the first wave. We were aware that the second wave was coming but we didn't plan to avoid unfortunate incidences like shortages of drugs, beds and oxygen,\\\" said epidemiologist Dr Lalit Kant.\\\"We didn't even learn from other countries which faced similar circumstances,\\\" he said.Some names have been changed on request.Read more stories by Vikas Pandey"},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Covid: What\u2019s the problem with the EU vaccine rollout? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/explainers-52380823","content":"The European Union (EU) has been criticised for the pace of its vaccination programme - 18% of its population has received the jab, compared with 55% in the UK.The EU rollout has been hit by delays in production and distribution as well as concerns over safety of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.Issues with AstraZenecaIn January, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups, but a number of EU countries initially refused to recommend its use for people over 65.France and Germany eventually revised their stance and approved the vaccine for people aged 65-74 at the beginning of March. But they were among 13 European countries who paused the AstraZeneca rollout again that month - following reports that a small number of people developed blood clots after receiving the jab.Most countries restarted it after the EMA said there was no evidence that the vaccine caused the clots.However, on 7 April the EMA said there was a \\\"possible link\\\" between the AstraZeneca vaccine and the clots. The agency concluded that neither age nor gender were a clear risk factor and it is still recommending the jab for all age groups.Nevertheless, several EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands say only people over 55 or 60 should get the jab, while others like Denmark have suspended the vaccine rollout altogether.The UK's drugs regulator recommends that people under 30 should be offered an alternative Covid vaccine to the AstraZeneca jab.The headlines surrounding AstraZeneca have led to a drop in confidence in the jab across the EU. The polling company YouGov reports only a third of Germans and 23% of French respondents now consider it safe.What's the vaccine exports row about?The EU is concerned the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom are based within the EU.On 24 March, the European Commission said the EU had exported 10.9 million jabs to the UK since February, but that it was not aware of any vaccines going the other way.EU leaders considered a ban on exports of vaccines to the UK but decided not to introduce one.Instead, they called for more transparency from the UK and other countries on the number of doses they export and urged AstraZeneca to deliver what it promised.The EU says it has exported 77 million doses to 33 countries since 1 December 2020.What's gone wrong with the EU vaccine rollout?In June 2020, all 27 member states joined a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines.However, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca, leading to supply problems.It also signed deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which saw early problems with production and distribution.In February, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the EU's vaccine failures, saying: \\\"We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time.\\\"The EU has approved the Johnson & Johnson\\\/Janssen vaccine, and has reached agreements to buy two other vaccines - Sanofi-GSK and CureVac - once they pass clinical trials.Can EU states make their own deals?Member states are allowed to strike separate deals with vaccine makers which have not signed agreements with the EU.French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed possible co-operation with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a video conference on 30 March.Hungary and Slovakia have already bought doses of Russia's Sputnik vaccine, and the Czech Republic is said to be considering buying it too.Austria and Denmark have announced they are joining forces with Israel to produce second-generation vaccines against mutations of the coronavirus.Under the terms of the EU scheme, member states are not supposed to strike deals with any vaccine manufacturer with whom the EU already has an agreement.However, the German government signed its own side-deal with Pfizer for 30 million extra doses in September.In January, the European Commission refused to say whether this had broken the terms of the EU scheme.Did the UK roll out vaccines quicker because of Brexit?The UK approved the Pfizer vaccine in November, nearly three weeks before EU regulators.The government claimed that being outside the EU allowed it to be more nimble in this area.However, the UK's approval of the jab would have been permitted anyway under EU law - a point made by the head of the UK medicines regulator.The UK could have joined the EU vaccine scheme last year while it was still in a transition phase with the EU, but it chose not to.If it had, the UK might not have been able to do as many deals with vaccine companies."},{"author":"Nick Triggle","title":"Is Europe's AstraZeneca jab decision-making flawed? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/health-56360646","content":"A number of countries have decided to suspend use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as a precaution following reports that some people have suffered blood clots after being given the jab.But is it a case of being too cautious? Are these nations missing the bigger picture?The decision has been made on the basis of the precautionary principle - a well-established approach in science and medicine that stresses the need to pause and review when evidence is uncertain.But in a fast-moving pandemic, when each decision can have major consequences, it is an approach which can sometimes do more harm than good.Cause or coincidence?The data supplied by AstraZeneca shows there have been 37 reports of blood clots among the 17m people across Europe who have been given the vaccine.But the key question that has to be asked is whether this is cause or coincidence? Would these clots have happened anyway?Adverse events like this are monitored carefully, so regulators can assess if they are happening more than they should.The 37 reports of clots are below the level you would expect. What is more, there is no strong biological explanation why the vaccine would cause a blood clot.It is why the World Health Organization and UK drugs regulators have all said there is no evidence of a link.Even the European Medicines Agency, which is looking into the reports, has suggested the vaccine should continue to be used in the meantime given the risk Covid presents to health.Unsurprisingly, therefore, the decisions by individual nations to pause their rollouts have baffled experts.Prof Adam Finn, a member of the WHO's working group on Covid vaccines, says stopping rollout in this way is \\\"highly undesirable\\\" and could undermine confidence in the vaccine, costing lives in the long-term.\\\"Making the right call in situations like this is not easy, but having a steady hand on the tiller is probably what is needed most.\\\"Has Europe got a problem with the vaccine?This is not the first time countries in Europe have exercised caution about the AstraZeneca vaccine.The precautionary principle was adopted by Germany, France and others when they did not initially recommend use of the vaccine for the over-65s. French President Emmanuel Macron even called it \\\"quasi-ineffective\\\".The over 65s decision has now been reversed, but the impact is still being felt it seems.Germany and France have supplies of the vaccine going to waste, with both countries having used fewer than half their supplies of the AstraZeneca jab so far. It has left them far more reliant on the Pfizer vaccine than the UK is.And this is threatening to have deadly consequences. France, Germany and the other major European nations all have higher rates of infection than the UK, and face the prospect of things getting worse before they get better.If you look back at the decision on the over-65s, you can see how it was made. The way the trials had been organised meant there was limited evidence on its use in older age groups.The organisers had wanted to recruit younger adults in the initial stages for safety reasons, so when it came to regulators assessing infection rates the data was not yet ready for older people.But there was evidence from blood samples that the vaccine had prompted a strong immune response in the older age groups. So there was no reason why the vaccine would not work in older age groups - it was just that insufficient time had passed to gather the evidence in the real world.There was also a problem interpreting results because of the way the trial was run. There was a lack of consistency across the different sites used.Protocols and practices followed varied across each, including the use of a half-dose in one.Some have described it as four trials within a trial. It created a somewhat messy set of data to interpret.Why bold decision-making may be bestThe UK looked past this and took the leap though - and within months was reporting \\\"spectacular\\\" results in reduced levels of serious illness in the over-80s.It was this pragmatic approach to decision-making that also led the UK to recommend up to a three-month gap between doses.This caused much controversy when it was announced at the end of December.The Pfizer vaccine was not tested like this in trials - the interval was three weeks.But again, the absence of evidence did not mean the move would not work or was not based on logic.The AstraZeneca trials did have longer intervals for some participants, which seemed to make it more effective, while evidence on the Moderna vaccine, which is a similar type of jab to Pfizer, also suggested it could work.It is also well-established that with two-dose vaccines, most of the protection is provided by the first dose, while the second boosts that and provides more long-lasting protection.With cases rising rapidly at the time, the UK was clear the benefit of maximising available vaccine supplies to provide some protection to more people was the right step even if the trial evidence did not directly support it.Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, an expert in understanding risk at Cambridge University, says it shows that sometimes you have to look beyond the precautionary principle and be bold in your decision-making.\\\"The precautionary principle favours inaction as a way of reducing risk. But the problem is that these are not normal times and inaction can be more risky than action.\\\"What is needed in circumstances like these, according to Sir David, is to work out what is most likely on the balance of probability. That requires looking at both the direct and indirect evidence and the context those decisions are being made in.\\\"Sometimes it can be harmful to wait for certainty. Not vaccinating people will costs lives.\\\""},{"author":"By Jake Horton","title":"Covid: Are some states lifting restrictions too soon? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-56297329","content":"A number of US states are lifting Covid restrictions, despite public health concerns about relaxing measures too soon.President Joe Biden has called moves to rapidly remove restrictions \\\"a big mistake\\\".So are some states in a good position to be lifting restrictions?What are the Covid rules?Individual US states are in charge of their own public health policy, and despite President Biden urging caution, some are lifting restrictions.The president has emphasised the use of face coverings and social distancing until the vaccine rollout can change the nature of the virus, saying he hopes the US will be \\\"closer to normal\\\" by July.More than 30 states still have a mask mandate in place, which generally requires people to wear a face covering inside private businesses and public buildings.But in January and February, several states removed their mask mandates, like North Dakota, Iowa and Montana.Most states have limits on the number of people who can enter businesses such as shops, bars and restaurants, but many of these limits are also being relaxed or removed altogether.In Texas, the state-wide mask mandate and social distancing requirements are no longer in place, and all businesses were able to open at 100% capacity from 10 March.Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves has also lifted that state's mask requirement, and has now allowed businesses to open at full capacity.Arizona and West Virginia have lifted capacity limits at restaurants and bars, but are keeping face coverings and social distancing requirements in place. Connecticut will do the same from 19 March.In Michigan, restaurants and bars are now allowed to operate at 50% capacity, up from 25%.Louisiana has done the same - allowing 75% capacity up from 50%.From 19 March, restaurants outside of New York City can operate at 75% capacity, up from 50%. Restaurants in New York City itself must continue to operate at 35%.What are the Covid rates?Governors have pointed to plummeting cases and hospital admissions in recent weeks as reasons for reopening.Across the US, Covid cases have been dropping since the middle of January, but they have begun to level off recently.In Texas and Mississippi, two states which have enacted the most rapid reopening, cases have even risen slightly in recent weeks, with health experts warning the rapid relaxation of restrictions risks a further rise in cases.Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, says: \\\"These states' lifting of measures like mask mandates are quite premature.\\\"\\\"Though the US case numbers have fallen considerably, our daily incidence is still dangerously high.\\\"Texas has recorded the second-highest number of cases and deaths across the US during the last week.New York was the only state to record more cases and California more deaths. Both of these states are maintaining restrictions, and mask wearing is enforced.Texas does have a bigger population than most states, but even in per capita terms it has one of the highest case rates - with about 143 confirmed cases per 100,000 people over the last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).Texas is recording about as many cases per day as the UK on average, despite having a population less than half the size.Mississippi has recorded fewer cases per capita than Texas and the majority of other states in the last week, with about 91 cases reported per 100,000 people.Hospital admissions have continued to fall in both states, but there tends to be a lag of a couple of weeks between infections and people entering hospital.There are hopes that fewer people who catch Covid will end up in hospital now vaccines are being rolled out, with the most vulnerable being protected.Does the vaccine rollout allow for reopening?The governors of Texas and Mississippi have highlighted their states' successful vaccine rollouts as a key factor in enabling them to fully reopen.But vaccination rates in these states are both below the national average, with only about 8% and 9% of their populations respectively being fully vaccinated (receiving two doses).Health experts warn this still leaves many people vulnerable to serious illness and death.Dr Vanessa Kerry, associate professor of medicine at Harvard University, said: \\\"We need to achieve a certain level of vaccination - 70% of the population - to adequately disrupt transmission and allow for a return toward normal.\\\"Kate Grabowksi, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University, said: \\\"Given that the Biden administration anticipates having enough vaccine for the entire US adult population by May, the lifting of restrictions feels like quitting the marathon at mile 25.\\\"The emergence of more contagious Covid variants is also a worry, with the CDC warning they pose a real threat to the country's progress.Dr Kerry added: \\\"This decision feels politically motivated and not public health driven.\\\"The Republican governors of both states made clear that the economy was a major consideration, insisting that with cases dropping and vaccines rolling out, it was time to restore livelihoods and reopen 100%.What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

But given it's also the flu season, how can you be sure whether you have coronavirus, a cold or the flu?They are all caused by different viruses, but can have similar symptoms.Most people who feel ill with coronavirus will have at least one of these three key symptoms:So what do you need to know about other things you may catch in the coming months?Does a fever mean I have coronavirus?A high temperature is 37.8C or above. A fever like this can happen when the body is fighting off any infection - not just coronavirus.It is best to use a thermometer to take a measure. But if you don't have one, check if you, or the person you are worried about, feels hot to the touch on the chest or back.Although fever is a key coronavirus symptom, it could be flu or a different infection.A high temperature is unlikely with a cold.If you have a fever, arrange a coronavirus test - you can use the NHS 111 coronavirus service online.What about a cough?If you have a cold or flu you may well have a cough, along with other symptoms.Flu usually comes on suddenly and sufferers will often experience muscle aches, chills, headaches, tiredness, a sore throat and a runny or stuffed nose, along with the cough. It feels worse than a heavy cold.Colds tend to develop more gradually and are less severe, although they do still make you feel unwell. Along with a cough, there may be sneezing and a sore throat and runny nose. Fever, chills, muscle aches and headaches are rare.A coronavirus cough means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing fits or \\\"episodes\\\" in 24 hours.If you usually have a cough because of a long-standing medical condition like COPD, it may be worse than usual.You should get tested for coronavirus if you develop a new, continuous cough.What do loss or change to smell or taste mean?These are key symptoms of coronavirus and mean you should get a test.It could still be that you have a simple cold. But you need to check, even if you don't feel unwell, to avoid the risk of spreading the virus.Does sneezing mean I've got coronavirus?Sneezing is not a symptom of coronavirus, and unless you also have a fever, cough or loss of smell and taste, you do not need a test.Sneeze droplets can spread infections though, so catch them in a tissue, put it in the bin and then wash your hands.Remember Hands. Face. Space to help stop the spread of coronavirus and other illnesses:More people in England are being offered a free flu jab this year too in the run-up to winter.How about a runny or blocked nose?A runny nose is not a reason to get tested for coronavirus, says NHS Scotland.Data from an app that has been monitoring Covid-19 symptoms, reported by UK users, suggests children present less often with respiratory symptoms and are more likely to be suffering from fever, headaches, fatigue and skin rashes.What if I am very unwell?People with coronavirus have a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe, although some will have none at all, but can still be infectious.Symptoms may appear up to two weeks after exposure to coronavirus, but usually around day five.Feeling breathless can be a sign of a more serious coronavirus infection.If you are having trouble breathing, contact your doctor online or over the phone, or the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.If you are very worried about sudden shortness of breath ring 999.And the NHS advises:"},{"author":"By James Gallagher","title":"Covid vaccine update: Those that work - and the others on the way - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/health-51665497","content":"Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world.More than 670 million doses of coronavirus vaccine have now been administered across 151 countries.A range of different vaccines is being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying.Why do we need a vaccine?It is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet the vast majority of people are still vulnerable.The restrictions on our lives are the only thing holding the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread.Vaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are \\\"the\\\" exit strategy from the pandemic.The big three - Pfizer\\\/BioNtech, Moderna and Oxford\\\/AstraZenecaThe three vaccine frontrunners are those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca.Pfizer and Moderna have both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design.They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence.These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US.The UK began the rollout of the Moderna jab in Wales on 7 April with 5,000 doses sent to Hywel Dda University Health Board vaccination centres.The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe.It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures.All three are supposed to be given as two doses, but the UK is prioritising giving as many people as possible the first dose and delaying the second.Janssen and NovavaxResults from large-scale trials on two new vaccines have also been presented recently.The work by Janssen, which is owned by Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax will now be reviewed by drugs regulators before their jabs can be approved.Janssen's vaccine uses the same technique as Oxford, but crucially is given as a single injection, rather than two. This, combined with it needing only a fridge to store and a billion doses planned this year, means it could make a significant impact around the world.Novavax is using a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body.What is the rest of the world doing?There are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US.The Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection.The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according to late stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised.The vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death.Are they all equally effective?It is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic.However, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid.Nonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown.Understanding which method produces the best results will be explored in challenge trials where people are deliberately infected with the virus.What about variants?New versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world.However, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first \\\"real-world\\\" data on the new variants.Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading.The results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target.We may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.What still needs to be done?Follow James on TwitterWhat do I need to know about the coronavirus?"},{"author":"By James Gallagher","title":"Coronavirus cure: What progress are we making on treatments? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/health-52354520","content":"Alongside Covid-19 vaccines, a number of drugs are being tested as possible treatments for people who already have the disease.Most of these are existing drugs that are being trialled against the virus.What work is being done to find treatments?There are three broad approaches being investigated:It is possible that different drugs will work better at different stages - such as antivirals at the beginning and immune drugs in late-stage diseases. Combinations of therapies will also be investigated.Steroid treatmentsThe steroid dexamethasone has been shown to cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators and by a fifth for those on oxygen.Further data suggests another steroid, hydrocortisone, is equally effective too.Both calm down inflammation (part of the immune response) in the body, which can become damaging in severe cases.Crucially, dexamethasone is also cheap which means it could be used all around the world.However, the drug does not work on people with milder symptoms.Tocilizumab and sarilumabResearchers report encouraging results from two anti-inflammatory medications, tocilizumab and sarilumab.In a trial carried out in six different countries, including the UK, with about 800 intensive care patients, the drugs reduced the number of deaths from 36% to 27%.Another study, called RECOVERY, also found tocilizumab added to the life-saving effects of dexamethasone.Tocilizumab and sarilumab dampen down inflammation, which can go into overdrive in Covid patients and cause damage to the lungs and other organs.Doctors could give them to a Covid patient who, despite receiving dexamethasone, is still deteriorating and needs intensive care.The research findings have not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal.Interferon betaInterferon beta, a protein which the body produces when it gets a viral infection, is at the centre of a large trial in the UK.It's being given to hospitalised Covid patients in the form of a spray which is inhaled.The hope is that the drug will stimulate the immune system, priming cells to be ready to fight off viruses.Early findings suggest interferon beta (which is normally used for treating multiple sclerosis) could cut the odds of a Covid patient in hospital developing severe disease - such as requiring ventilation - by almost 80%.What other drugs have been trialled?Remdesivir is an antiviral drug - originally developed to treat Ebola - that showed promising early results.However, in October 2020, the World Health Organization advised against its use for Covid, saying that it \\\"appeared to have little or no effect on hospitalised Covid\\\", in terms of either death rates, length of stay in hospital, or seriousness of illness.What do I need to know about the coronavirus?Can malaria drugs stop coronavirus?Chloroquine, and the related drug, hydroxychloroquine, may have antiviral and immune-calming properties.The drugs were thrust into the spotlight as potential coronavirus therapies, largely because of claims made by President Trump, and because early laboratory tests showed they could inhibit the coronavirus.However, the UK's Recovery trial found that hydroxychloroquine does not work as a treatment for Covid-19 and the WHO has stopped trialling the drug.Can survivors' blood treat coronavirus?People who survive an infection should have antibodies in their blood that can attack the virus.Blood plasma (the part which contains the antibodies) can be extracted from those who have recovered and then given to sick patients as \\\"convalescent plasma\\\".It is hoped transfusing seriously-ill patients with the plasma can give struggling immune systems a helping hand.This therapy is now being tested in people in the UK and the US, among other countries. Two separate UK trials are currently running - one in intensive care patients, the other in hospital patients.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given emergency authorisation for the use of plasma to treat coronavirus patients based on promising results from early trials - although some experts say it's too soon to know how effective the treatment is.Why do we need treatments as well as vaccines?While vaccines can stop people from contracting Covid and becoming seriously ill, treatments will still be needed for those who already have it.Having an effective treatment would, in essence, make coronavirus a milder disease.If it stopped people who were admitted to hospital from needing ventilation, then there would be less risk of intensive care units in hospitals being overwhelmed.Follow James on Twitter"},{"author":"By Flora Carmichael and Marianna Spring","title":"Coronavirus: Here's how you can stop bad information from going viral - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/blogs-trending-51967889","content":"Coronavirus misinformation is flooding the internet.A UK parliamentary sub-committee is asking members of the public to submit examples. The committee has particularly requested submissions of disinformation spread in private groups and closed apps such as WhatsApp.Meanwhile, experts are calling on the public to practise \\\"information hygiene\\\".So what can you do to stop the spread of bad information online?1. Stop and thinkYou want to help family and friends and keep them in the loop. So when you receive fresh advice - whether by email, WhatsApp, Facebook or Twitter - you might quickly forward it on to them.But experts say the number one thing you can do to halt misinformation is to simply stop and think.If you have any doubts, pause, and check it out further.2. Check your sourceBefore you forward it on, ask some basic questions about where the information comes from.It's a big red flag if the source is \\\"a friend of a friend\\\" or \\\"my aunt's colleague's neighbour\\\".We recently tracked how a misleading post from someone's \\\"uncle with a master's degree\\\" went viral.Some of the details in the post were accurate - some versions, for example, encouraged hand washing to slow the spread of the virus. But other details were potentially harmful, making unproven claims about how to diagnose the illness.\\\"The most reliable sources of information remain public health bodies like the NHS, the World Health Organisation, or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA.\\\" says Claire Milne, deputy editor of UK-based fact-checking organisation Full Fact.Experts are not infallible. But they are much more reliable than a stranger's distant relative on WhatsApp.3. Could it be a fake?Appearances can be deceptive.It is possible to impersonate official accounts and authorities, including BBC News and the government. Screenshots can also be changed to make it look like information has come from a trusted public body.Check known and verified accounts and websites. If you can't easily find the information, it might be a hoax. And if a post, video or a link looks fishy - it probably is.Capital letters and mismatched fonts are something fact-checkers use as an indicator a post might be misleading, according to Claire Milne from Full Fact.4. Unsure whether it's true? Don't shareDon't forward things on \\\"just in case\\\" they might be true. You might be doing more harm than good.Often we post things into places where we know there are experts - like doctors or medical professionals. That might be OK, but make sure you're very clear about your doubts. And beware - that photo or text you share might later be stripped of its context.5. Check each fact, individuallyThere's a voice note that has been circulating on WhatsApp. The person speaking in the note says she's translating advice from a \\\"colleague who has a friend\\\" working at a hospital. It's been sent to the BBC by dozens of people around the world.But it's a mix of accurate and inaccurate advice.When you get sent long lists of advice, it's easy to believe everything in them just because you know for certain that one of the tips (say, about hand washing) is true.But that's not always the case.6. Beware emotional postsIt's the stuff that gets us fearful, angry, anxious, or joyful that tends to really go viral.\\\"Fear is one of the biggest drivers that allows misinformation to thrive,\\\" says Claire Wardle of First Draft, an organisation that helps journalists tackle online misinformation.Urgent calls for action are designed to ramp up anxiety - so be careful.\\\"People want to help their loved ones stay safe, so when they see 'Tips for preventing the virus!' or 'Take this health supplement!' people want to do whatever they can to help,\\\" she says.7. Think about biasesAre you sharing something because you know it's true - or just because you agree with it?Carl Miller, research director of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media at think tank Demos, says we're more likely to share posts that reinforce our existing beliefs.\\\"It's when we're angrily nodding our head that we're most vulnerable,\\\" he says. \\\"That's when, above everything else, we just need to slow down everything that we do online.\\\"Learn more about media literacy:Have you seen misleading information - or something you have doubts about?

It is compulsory to wear one on public transport and in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres.While medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering.Here's our guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them.Whether you're handy with a sewing machine, like cutting up old t-shirts or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, covering the nose and mouth, and you should be able to breathe comfortably.One study has shown that the best materials to use are tightly woven cottons or twill, natural silk or quilted cotton material. But you can also make do with what you have around your home.No sewing necessaryLet's start with a simple one.The government advises washing your hands thoroughly or using hand sanitiser before putting on and after taking off face coverings.How to wear your maskOur next example uses an old t-shirt, preferably thick cotton or a cotton and polyester mix. And still nothing to sew.Homemade masks are not necessarily intended to help the wearer, the government says, but they could help stop you inadvertently passing on the disease to others if you have it but are not showing symptoms.If you do have coronavirus symptoms - such as a high temperature or continuous cough, you should stay indoors and isolate at home.Whichever face covering you use, they are not a substitute for other guidance, such as social distancing and hand washing. Hand hygiene especially is just as important as before - so washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds when you get home.The sewing challengeOur third example needs a few stitches, but they can be as simple or as complicated as you like - as long as it all holds in place and survives a few washes.There are plenty of other ways to make a face covering - and many examples on social media from professional, designer logo'd masks to cut-up sports socks.Have fun giving them a go. Remember you might need more than one, so you have something to use while the other is being washed. Face coverings should not be used for children under the age of two years or people who might not be able to fit them correctly.When you have your mask, here are a few reminders of what not to do.All masks shown were made by members of the BBC's Visual Journalism teamGraphics: Irene de la Torre-Arenas, Joy Roxas"},{"author":"By The Visual and Data Journalism Team","title":"Covid-19 in the UK: How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-51768274","content":"There have been almost 4.4 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 127,000 people have died, government figures show.However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.Almost 33 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine.Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:If you can't see the look-up click here.Cases have declinedThe average number of new daily cases in the UK has fallen substantially since the start of the year, but the rate of decline has slowed in recent weeks.Two weeks ago the government changed the way cases in England are reported. Cases that were identified using a lateral flow test have been removed if the person subsequently took a PCR test and tested negative within three days.This means 8,010 cases were removed from the case data, causing the overall total to fall.A further 2,963 confirmed cases in the UK were announced by the government on Monday.Last month infection levels in secondary school-age children in England increased slightly after they returned to school. But the Office for National Statistics (ONS) says this trend does not appear to have continued.According to the ONS, which tests a random sample of adults and children in the community, infections have decreased across the UK - in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.It is thought the infection rate was much higher than was evident from the reported number of cases during the first peak in spring last year. Testing capacity was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.The darker blue areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.The nations of the UK are moving to the next stages of easing restrictions on everyday life.England saw a further easing of restrictions last week, with non-essential shops, gyms and hairdressers allowed to re-open, along with outdoor spaces at pubs and restaurants.Northern Ireland also lifted stay at home restrictions, with people asked to \\\"stay local\\\" and continue to work from home where they can. Up to ten people from two households are now able to meet outdoors, and the remaining school year groups 8-11 returned to classrooms.In Wales, a drop in Covid cases prompted the government to bring forward some dates for reopening, with, all non-essential shops allowed to reopen and students returning to face-to-face teaching.In Scotland, hairdressers, homeware shops and garden centres re-opened from 5 April, and the rules were eased further last week to allow six people from up to six households to meet outside.Vaccine rollout continuesAlmost 33 million people - or more than half of all UK adults - have now received a first dose of a vaccine and over 10 million people have had a second.Saturday 20 March saw the highest number of vaccinations given in a single day - more than 844,000.The government has often described vaccine supplies as \\\"lumpy\\\" and the NHS has warned that there will be a \\\"significant reduction in weekly supply\\\" of vaccines in April.Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the UK is \\\"building up long-term UK manufacturing capabilities\\\" for vaccines, with Novavax set to produce a jab in the North East.People have now started to receive the Moderna jab, the third vaccine to be given in the UK.In total, more than 27 million people in England have had one vaccine dose.In Scotland, more than 2.7 million people have had their first dose, while the figure is over 1.6 million in Wales and more than 860,000 in Northern Ireland.More second doses are being given than first doses now, as people in earlier priority groups receive their booster injections.Saturday 17 April saw the largest number of second doses in a single day with 499,635 jabs given.People over the age of 45 are now being invited to get a Covid jab, after the government announced it had reached its target of offering a first vaccination to all over 50s and those in high risk groups before its target date of 15 April.All adults in the UK are expected to be offered their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of July.However, the government has announced that those under the age of 30 will be offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine, after new evidence linking the vaccine to rare blood clots.Daily deaths fallingA further four deaths across the UK within 28 days of a positive test were reported on Monday.Two deaths were in England and two in Wales. No deaths were reported in Scotland or Northern Ireland.Rules were amended last summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been nearly 112,000.Situation improving in hospitalsThe most recent government figures show 2,186 people with coronavirus in hospital in the UK.Numbers in mid-January reached almost double the highest point of the peak last spring, but have been falling since then.London, the South East and the Midlands saw the highest numbers in the winter peak, but patient numbers have fallen in all UK nations and regions in recent months.But everywhere saw more patients in hospital in the winter surge than during the first wave last spring.Death toll from coronavirus could be 150,000When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number.First, government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus - and that total is now more than 127,000.According to ONS figures released on Tuesday, the UK has now seen 150,000 deaths - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus.The third measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was just over 119,000 by 2 April.In total, there were 9,458 deaths registered in the week to 2 April, 18% below the average seen in the five years 2015 to 2019, but register offices were closed for the Good Friday bank holiday meaning some deaths may not have been recorded until the following week.Of the total deaths, 450 were related to coronavirus - down by 350 on the previous week.There have now been more deaths involving Covid than \\\"excess\\\" deaths, which means non-Covid deaths must be below usual levels.This could be because of a milder flu season - resulting from less travel and more social distancing - and because some people who might have died for other reasons had there been no pandemic, died of Covid.What is the R number?The \\\"R number\\\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.The latest estimate for England is 0.7 to 1.0. In Scotland it's currently 0.8 to 1.0, in Wales it is 0.6 to 0.9 and in Northern Ireland it around 0.95 to 1.4.The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Coronavirus vaccine: India begins world's biggest drive - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-india-55632782","content":"A sanitation worker became the first Indian to receive a Covid vaccine as the country began the world's largest inoculation drive.Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the programme, which aims to vaccinate more than 1.3 billion people against Covid.He paid tribute to front-line workers who will be the first to receive jabs.India has recorded the second-highest number of Covid-19 infections in the world after the United States.Millions of doses of two approved vaccines - Covishield and Covaxin - were shipped across the country in the days leading up to the start of the drive.\\\"We are launching the world's biggest vaccination drive and it shows the world our capability,\\\" Mr Modi, said, addressing the country on Saturday morning.He added that India was well prepared to vaccinate its population with the help of an app, which would help the government track the drive and ensure that nobody was left out.Mr Modi spoke at length about doctors, nurses and other front-line workers \\\"who showed us the light\\\" in \\\"dark times\\\".\\\"They stayed away from their families to serve humanity. And hundreds of them never went home. They gave their life to save others. And that is why the first jabs are being given to healthcare workers - this is our way of paying respect to them.\\\"At the sceneGeeta Pandey, BBC News, DelhiDoctors and medical staff at Delhi's Max hospital tell me a lot of hope is being pinned on the vaccination drive. One official described it \\\"as a new dawn\\\" and said \\\"it's the beginning of Covid's end\\\".Inside the waiting room, there are posters on the wall with information about the documents one needs to bring, how safe the vaccine is, and the precautions that need to be taken even after one's been vaccinated. Among those being vaccinated on Saturday are doctors, nurses and front-office staff from all departments.The names have been been chosen alphabetically so those getting jabs are mostly those with names starting with the letter A.\\\"The pandemic has played havoc in the country. I hope the vaccine will rid us of the fears and we will be able to breathe easy,\\\" Dr Anil Dass said after getting the jab.Ashutosh Chaturvedi, a 31-year-old male nurse described as a \\\"Covid warrior\\\" by hospital officials, became the first recipient of the vaccine at Max.\\\"I'm fine, I feel good,\\\" he told reporters as he came down the hospital ramp, which has been decorated with blue, green and white balloons.Since April, he told me, he's worked in the emergency wing of the Covid ward, tending to those afflicted with the coronavirus.\\\"I haven't seen my wife and nine-month-old daughter since then. A month later, once I've received the second dose, I'll visit my family,\\\" he said.Mr Modi also appealed to people to continue adhering to Covid-19 safety protocols like wearing masks and following social distancing. He said the country cannot afford to be complacent as vaccinating the entire population will take time.He also urged people not to believe any \\\"propaganda and rumours about the safety of the vaccines\\\".\\\"I want to tell people that the approval to these vaccines was given only after scientists and experts were satisfied about its safety,\\\" he said.An estimated 10 million health workers will be vaccinated in the first round, followed by policemen, soldiers, municipal and other front-line workers.Next in line will be people aged over 50 and anyone under 50 with serious underlying health conditions. India's electoral rolls, which contain details of some 900 million voters, will be used to identify eligible recipients.The government plans to vaccinate 300 million people by early August. This will happen in state-run health care centres, schools, colleges, community halls, municipal offices and wedding halls.Several hospitals across India are giving the first doses of the vaccine.Dr Atul Peters was among those who got the jab at Max hospital.\\\"It's a very big day. I'm grateful to those who worked hard to make this a reality. I was very very happy when I got a call informing me that my name was on the list.\\\"We worked hard during the pandemic to save lives and we are also taking the jab first to dispel fears in people's minds that the vaccine is not safe,\\\" he told the BBC.India's drug regulator has given the green light to two vaccines - Covishield (the local name for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine developed in the UK) and Covaxin, locally-made by pharma company Bharat Biotech.But concerns have been raised over the efficacy of Covaxin because the regulator's emergency approval came before the completion of Phase 3 clinical trials. The regulator and the manufacturer have said the vaccine is safe, and that the efficacy data would be available by February.Both vaccines will be given as two injections, 28 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity would begin to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect 14 days after the second dose.The status of the vaccines and recipients will be electronically tracked in real time - some 8 million people who will receive the early jabs have been already registered. More than 600,000 people have been trained for the drive.The jabs will be voluntary, and recipients will be given a certificate of vaccination after they complete both doses.\\\"I expect India's vaccination programme will be run much better than most countries because of the considerable government investment and early preparedness,\\\" Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India's best-known vaccine experts, told the BBC.With more than 10 million cases, India has recorded the second-highest number of Covid-19 infections in the world, after the US.The largest vaccination drive in the country, however, begins at a time when infections have fallen sharply, and much of life has returned to normal. A limited availability of doses in the initial phase, therefore, is not likely to pose a problem.Most scientists feel India is primed for the challenge as it is a vaccine-making powerhouse and has run, for decades, a well-oiled immunisation programme for tens of millions of new-borns and mothers-to-be.But the real challenges will begin when the general population starts receiving the jabs.India will use its formidable election machinery to deliver and track doses to recipients in far corners of the country. It is also likely to use digital platforms and apps to enable people to register for the doses.However, not every Indian owns a smart phone or knows how to operate an app, so it will be interesting to see what the government does to make sure that there are no inadvertent exclusions.Vaccine hesitancy is the other concern.The recent controversy over the hurried approval of Covaxin, many feel, could undermine confidence. There's a history of hesitancy about receiving the polio vaccine in parts of northern India, triggered by rumours about vaccines being impure and affecting fertility. Similar disinformation is now circulating about Covid vaccines on social networking apps, such as WhatsApp.The government will need consistent, clear-eyed communication to bolster vaccine acceptance and community perception of the programme.Vaccines come with side effects for some people. India has a 34-year-old surveillance programme for monitoring such \\\"adverse events\\\" following immunisation.But researchers have found that benchmarks for reporting side effects still remain weak. A failure to transparently report adverse effects could easily lead to fear-mongering around vaccines."},{"author":"By Regan Morris and Sophie Long","title":"Covid in California: The state is struggling to contain the virus - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/election-us-2020-55578098","content":"California was praised for acting swiftly to contain the coronavirus last spring. Now more than 31,000 people have died of the virus in the state. What went wrong?California was the first to issue a state-wide stay-at-home order, and experts at the time predicted the pandemic would peak here in April with fewer than 2,000 lives lost.But since November, deaths have surged by more than 1,000%. In Los Angeles alone, nearly 2,000 people died this week.Makeshift morgues have been set up across the state, ICUs are full, oxygen is being rationed and ambulance teams have been told not to transport those unlikely to survive the night because hospitals are too full.Disneyland, which has been closed since March, is now being turned into a massive vaccination centre, along with Dodger Stadium, in the hopes of controlling what's become a super surge.Why is California in such dire Covid straits?\\\"Fatigue,\\\" says Dr Neha Nanda, of the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine. \\\"It's multifaceted, but fatigue is a big reason why.\\\"Southern California and Los Angeles are the hardest hit regions in California and the United States right now.Local and state officials begged Californians to not make holiday plans from Thanksgiving through to New Year. But even strict mandates here often go unenforced.Many businesses have collapsed, the film industry is mostly dormant. Productions that do get the green light are often forced to shut down again due to coronavirus outbreaks on set.And most schools in California have been closed since 13 March, with children isolated at home on computers, often with their parents away at work or trying to work alongside their children on overstretched Wi-Fi.And like most places, Covid-19 has hit Los Angeles' poor the hardest.Dr Heidi Behforouz, the medical director of LA County's Housing for Health, says she thinks Los Angeles is a city accustomed to tolerating extreme inequities in a country that does the same.\\\"We're sort of a pull yourself up by your bootstraps kind of country - we're very individually minded and it's hard for us to think about giving up what we feel is our right to do what we want,\\\" she says.While Covid-19 can infect anyone, it's definitely more cruel to the have-nots than the haves.For every case of Covid in Beverly Hills, there are six times more in Compton. While two people from Bel Air have died, more than 230 people have lost their lives in working-class East LA.And now, the virus is surging through LA's vast homeless population. People who live in Los Angeles are used to driving past dozens, hundreds or even thousands of people living on the streets every day.At the beginning of the pandemic, they were largely spared from infection - likely because they're so isolated as a population.Cities and counties are using trailers and motels to house Covid positive people without shelter.The Union Rescue Mission on LA's Skid Row is normally buzzing with lively dinner guests and residents. But in these pandemic days it's quiet, with most of its residents isolated in quarantine.Behind the building, a fabric tent meant to house the most vulnerable women on the streets is now a field hospital full of men with Covid, tended to by doctors and nurses covered head-to-toe in the now familiar protective gear.\\\"The Covid situation is the worst ever and this is the most horrific battle we've ever been in,\\\" says Reverend Andy Bales, who runs the mission.\\\"It's like playing chess with a monster genius - every move we make, it gets overcome by Covid.\\\"At the beginning of the pandemic in March, Mr Bales was relieved that the homeless population seemed spared from the coronavirus.But then in April, a beloved staff member at the mission, Gerald Shiroma, died of the virus. He was 56.Mr Shiroma had overcome a meth addiction and a life on the streets to become a sober and was a beloved driver at the mission.\\\"He was a wonderful guy,\\\" Mr Bales says. \\\"Everyone here loved him.\\\"As exhausted frontline medical workers continue their fight, the fear is that things will continue to get worse.As the virus spreads, it's likely mutating more than we know, says Dr Neha Nanda.\\\"Maybe the bigger the place, the more variation,\\\" she says."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Coronavirus: Why are infections rising again in US? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/election-us-2020-54423928","content":"The news of President Donald Trump's positive coronavirus test, and his subsequent hospitalisation, has reminded the country that no-one is protected from this virus.So where is the US right now in dealing with the pandemic?What's the overall picture?With about 7.5 million coronavirus cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world - about one fifth of the global total despite having only 4% of the population.After the initial spike in late March, social distancing restrictions gradually brought infections to heel. By May, case numbers had stabilised. But as states peeled back lockdown measures, cases began to rise, reaching a countrywide high in July.But as summer hotspots - like Arizona, Florida and California - brought their outbreaks under control, surges have developed elsewhere, with fast-moving outbreaks in North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.In recent weeks, infections have risen steadily, with national cases increasing for three weeks in a row. Though numbers have so far not reached the record-breaking levels of July and August, the country is reporting more than 40,000 new cases each day.Hospitalisations, too, are on the rise. According to data compiled by the Covid Tracking Project, the average number of people hospitalised for coronavirus in a week rose recently for the first time since July.Why are cases rising?It's difficult to explain precisely why.One contributing factor has been the return to school for US students.A recent study from the US Centers for Disease Control on the almost 100,000 coronavirus cases reported between 2 August and 5 September - around when college students began their return to school - found that weekly cases among those aged 18-22 increased by 55% nationally.The greatest increases came from the Northeast (which includes New York, Connecticut and New Jersey) and the Midwest, which is a region located west of the Northeast, including Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin.There have now been more than 130,000 cases identified at more than 1,300 American colleges, according to reporting from the New York Times.Another compounding factor is the change in seasons. Top US virus expert Dr Anthony Fauci said last month that we should plan to \\\"hunker down\\\" through the autumn and winter. \\\"It's not going to be easy,\\\" he said.Why? A key piece of coronavirus health advice has been to do things outside. This gets more difficult as temperatures slip. Instead, cold weather will drive people indoors to closer quarters with potentially poor ventilation, where the risk of spread is heightened.What's more, viruses tend to survive more easily in cold conditions.There are now additional fears that the virus will collide with the US influenza season - which typically begins in October - threatening to overwhelm the health system.Are deaths still falling?Here's some good news - virus deaths in the US are continuing to fall, albeit gradually.As of early October, the daily average had reached around 720, a marked drop from the staggering 1,000-plus daily fatalities recorded this summer.But the bad news? This decline appears to have slowed in recent weeks. And recent daily tallies suggest some ground has been lost since the record lows of early July.In total, over 210,000 people have died of Covid-19 across the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.What are the hotspots?Case numbers remain high throughout much of the country, with concentrations in the Upper Midwest (that includes Wisconsin and Minnesota) and parts of the West.Wisconsin is one of the hardest-hit states. Case numbers there have quadrupled in the past month, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Hospitalisations more than doubled throughout the month of September, and the test positivity rate is now at a weekly average of 19.6%,To put this figure into perspective: the World Health Organization (WHO) in May suggested a positive case rate at or below 5%, for two weeks, before reopening measures were implemented.North Dakota is also in the throes of a major outbreak. For the fourth week in a row, it led the US in most cases per capita - at 548 cases per one million residents. Neighbouring South Dakota, as well as Montana, Utah and Idaho are also recording severe upticks in new infections.Sunbelt states Arizona, Florida and California - pummelled by the virus this summer - are now getting some relief, with steep declines.Is New York City shutting down again?New York City, once the epicentre of the US outbreak, is once again facing climbing case numbers. In late September, as many public schools began their reopening, Mayor Bill de Blasio reported a daily positive test rate of 3.25% - the highest daily rate since June.Amid mounting fears of a second wave, Mr de Blasio announced plans to close nonessential businesses in nine hotspots in Brooklyn and Queens - a plan quickly refused by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a fellow Democrat and political rival.Mr Cuomo said there \\\"could be\\\" a future rollback of indoor and outdoor dining in hotspot areas, but described the closure of nonessential businesses in certain postal codes as \\\"arbitrary and capricious\\\".But despite the political tug-of-war, the city will go ahead with plans to shutter public and private school in those nine areas, home to about 500,000 New Yorkers, including large communities of Orthodox Jews, among whom the virus has been spreading rapidly.\\\"I'm not going to recommend or allow any New York City family to send their child to a school that I wouldn't send my child,\\\" Mr Cuomo said of the closures.It's interesting that these considerations are playing out in New York City even though it still has a lower positivity rate than many other parts of the country.."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Covid: How are European countries tackling the pandemic? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/explainers-53640249","content":"Europe's vaccination campaign has been hit by delays and the number of infections is rising in many countries.Lockdowns are once again coming into force, as governments take action against a third wave.France: Third lockdown and closure of schoolsNew restrictions are being rolled out across the country.Schools are closing and moving to remote learning at least until 26 April.Non-essential shops across the country also have to close.People will be allowed to exercise outdoors within 10km (6 miles) of their home but cannot travel to other parts of the country unless they have a valid reason. As in previous lockdowns, they will have to fill out a form to explain why they have left their homes.There is a nationwide curfew between 19:00 and 06:00.Germany: Different regional rulesGermany has extended its current restrictions until 18 April but individual states are able to introduce their own rules.Berlin is introducing nightly curfews for groups and further rules on social contacts.But in the state of Saarland, in south-west of the country, outside restaurants, theatres, cinemas and gyms are allowed to open to customers who show a negative Covid test taken within the previous 24 hours.Across Germany people must now wear clinical masks, such as single-use surgical masks or filtering face-piece respirators (known as FFP2 masks), in shops and on public transport.Italy: Lockdown measures to continueUntil 30 April, all of Italy's regions are in either red or orange zones, the two highest-risk categories.In red zones, all schools and universities are closed, people can only move around for essential reasons, only essential shops are open and restaurants, cafes and bars can offer takeaway or delivery services.The same rules on restaurants apply in orange zones as well, but shops, hairdressers, beauticians and schools can remain open (with partial distance learning for older pupils).A curfew between 22:00 and 05:00 remains in place nationwide, all non-essential travel between regions is banned and masks are compulsory in all public spaces, indoors and outdoors.Denmark: Proposals for \\\"corona passes\\\"The Danish government has proposed a \\\"corona pass\\\" for everyone over the age of 15.The pass, available on mobile phone and on paper, will show whether people have been vaccinated, previously infected or have had a negative test in the past 72 hours.It will enable people to fulfil the requirements to go to the hairdresser, a restaurant or elsewhere, as the country gradually lifts restrictions.In Copenhagen, hairdressers and tattooists can now reopen and theme parks and zoos are already open.If the situation allows, small shopping centres will open from 13 April, outdoor eating at cafes and restaurants will be allowed from 21 April, along with bigger shopping centres. Cinemas and indoor dining could resume on 6 May.Greece: Opening for tourism in mid-MayThe Greek government announced the opening of borders on 14 May for all travellers who have been vaccinated or who provide a negative coronavirus test.Meanwhile, some lockdown measures are being eased. The nationwide curfew now starts at 21:00 both at the weekend and during the week. The earlier weekend start time was 19:00.Hair and beauty salons can operate by appointment while parks are open to public, with social distancing measures in place and mandatory use of a face mask.Poland: Schools and businesses closedNon-essential shops are closed and there are strict limits on the number of people allowed in essential shops.Schools and nurseries are closed.Hairdressers, beauty salons and sports facilities (except for professionals) are also closed.The Czech Republic: Some children allowed back at schoolOne of the hardest-hit countries in the EU, the Czech Republic is beginning a slight relaxation of some lockdown measures.From 12 April, primary schools are reopening for lower-grade pupils. Higher primary grades, high schools and universities will continue with distance-learning. Kindergartens will reopen for the pre-school year only.Most shops will remain shut, but stationery and children's clothes shops as well as farmers' markets will be allowed to open.Spain: Curfew and other measures to continueTravelling between different provinces has been allowed to restart.There is also a curfew from 23:00 to 06:00, although the regions can bring this forward to 22:00 if they wish.A maximum of six people are allowed to meet in open public spaces, four in closed areas and no mixing of households is allowed in private homes.Anyone aged over six must wear a face mask in all indoor and outdoor public spaces.Belgium: Lockdown continuesPrimary and secondary schools, as well as universities, are closed until 19 April.Non-essential shops are open, but only by appointment. Hairdressers, beauty salons and massage salons are closed.All non-essential travel remains banned.Portugal: Some easing of restrictionsPortugal started to ease some of the lockdown measures from 15 March, with the reopening of some businesses and nurseries and primary schools for classroom teaching.Museums, secondary schools and universities could be reopened on 19 April, if the situation allows.Netherlands: Lockdown and curfew continueLockdown rules have been extended until 20 April.A curfew is in place from 22:00 until 04:30.Secondary school pupils are now having lessons at school for at least one day a week, and from 26 April university students will be able to attend at least one day of classes as well.Hairdressers and other close-contact professions (apart from sex workers) have reopened, and shops can open to customers by appointment.Bars and restaurants remain closed, along with non-essential shops. Gatherings of more than two people are banned.The government says people should not book holidays abroad until at least the middle of May.Ireland: Gradual reopening after EasterFrom 12 April, people will be able to travel anywhere within their own county.No visitors are currently allowed in private homes or gardens unless it is for the care of children, the elderly or those who are vulnerable. Weddings are limited to six people and funerals to 10.But, from mid-April, outdoor meetings of two households will be allowed and two fully vaccinated people will be able to meet indoors.Sweden: New government coronavirus powersSweden tried to avoid imposing rules when other countries were in lockdown, but new emergency law now give the government the power to impose coronavirus-related curbs for the first time.Until now, the Swedish government has relied mostly on the public following official health recommendations voluntarily.Shops and gyms are open but must limit numbers of people.A maximum of eight are allowed to gather in public and in private.

the proportion of those with Covid who then die - was lower than elsewhere in the world.There were a number of theories put forward as to why that might be the case, such as the relatively younger population, and possible cross-immunity from other coronaviruses.But the Africa CDC has now warned about rising fatality rates in the continent, saying that of the 55 countries they monitor, 21 are now reporting fatality rates above the current global average of 2.2%.The fatality rate for Africa has crept up since July last year when it was on average 2.1% - to 2.7% in April this year (measured over the duration of the pandemic).The WHO says the fatality rate is continuing to rise with the most recent data for the past month of 3.7%The global fatality rate has fallen since the start of the pandemic, which in itself would put more African countries above the global average.And fatality rates are also affected by how much testing is done - a country with low levels of testing will show a higher death rate because many non-fatal Covid cases are going undetected.More importantly, data for deaths should be treated with caution, given the wide variations in how countries record them.In South Africa, research into excess deaths - that's the number of deaths in a certain period above what would normally be expected - shows that there were 153,668 more deaths between 6 May last year and 10 April this year.The official death toll from Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic is just above 53,000.And South Africa was just one of eight countries on the continent that the BBC found in a recent investigation had adequate death registration systems.So coronavirus deaths across Africa as a whole are likely to be under-recorded.There are wide variations in testing rates and while some countries have reduced testing, others have maintained or even increased it at different points during the pandemic.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questions"},{"author":"By Shruti Menon","title":"Coronavirus: Is India's test and tracing strategy working? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-india-55083825","content":"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called on the country's worst-affected states to give top priority to testing and contact tracing to combat coronavirus.Daily cases in India have been falling since mid-September, but there's concern that varied testing strategies may be hindering the battle against the disease.What type of testing is India doing?India had been using the what's known as a PCR test - regarded as the gold standard of testing - very widely.But currently, only 60% of all tests use this method, and many Indian states - who are in charge of their own health policies - have switched to rapid antigen testing (RAT), a faster but less reliable method.RAT tests are known to miss up to 50% of cases due to false negatives (where infected people are not detected), although some experts believe they are still useful in areas which have become virus hotspots.\\\"The ability to detect cases depends on a relative mix of the less sensitive RAT test and the gold standard PCR test,\\\" says Prof Gautam Menon, an infectious disease expert from Ashoka University in Haryana.India isn't alone in using these tests, and some European countries grappling with further waves of infection have also resorted to rapid testing.Is testing consistent across the country?No, it's not.Maharashtra is the worst-affected state in India, with 17% of all cases.In terms of total coronavirus cases, it's followed by states with smaller populations such as Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.But Uttar Pradesh and Bihar - two other states with large populations - appear to be doing much better.They have lower proportions of confirmed cases at 2.9% and 1.6%.What the testing data reveals is that in both Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (and some other states) less than 50% of total tests use the PCR method - so cases are being missed.In Maharashtra, nearly 60% of tests have been PCR tests (although they are increasingly using rapid testing in the state capital, Mumbai.)And Tamil Nadu state has relied totally on PCR testing, which means it is likely to have a far more accurate idea of the spread of the virus.Patchy testing levels across statesThere's evidence that states may also not be testing enough in highly populated areas where infections tend to be higher.As of 30 November, 13% of Uttar Pradesh's cases were found in its capital, Lucknow, although fewer than 6% of total tests in the state have been carried out there.Kanpur district has the second-highest number of cases in the state, but just under 3% of total tests have been conducted there.District-level data in Bihar reveals a similar trend. One of the most populous areas, Patna, accounts for 18% of all reported cases yet has conducted only 3% of the total tests in the state.Other parts of the state have carried out relatively high numbers of tests, but have fewer cases.\\\"If you do fewer tests in areas where cases are high and vice-versa [more tests where cases are low], you end up reporting less cases while meeting a specific high-testing target,\\\" says Dr Rijo John, a public health policy analyst in Kerala.He adds this can make the data on case numbers a bit meaningless.Varying surveillance systemsIndia's Covid-19 national guidelines say states should trace contacts of at least 80% of positive cases within 72 hours.But India's parliamentary committee on health and family welfare has said that \\\"poor contact tracing and less testing could have been a factor for the exponential growth of Covid\\\".It's difficult to get reliable information from every state about contact tracing.Uttar Pradesh was recently lauded by the WHO for \\\"early and systemic tracking of high-risk contacts\\\".By contrast, data for Karnataka shows its numbers for primary and secondary contact tracing have fallen since September.Telangana state has data for the proportion of tests carried out on the primary and secondary contacts of those who have contracted Covid-19.This has come down a bit since September along with overall testing numbers.In Kerala, the data shows 95% of all cases since 4 May have been traced back to the primary and secondary contacts of infected persons.But none of these datasets reveals if 80% of contacts of someone who was positive were traced within the timeframe set out in the national guidelines.And many states do not make this data public.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"},{"author":"By Flora Carmichael and Jack Goodman","title":"Vaccine rumours debunked: Microchips, 'altered DNA' and more - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/54893437","content":"We've looked into some of the most widely shared false vaccine claims - everything from alleged plots to put microchips into people to the supposed re-engineering of our genetic code.'Altered DNA' claimsThe fear that a vaccine will somehow change your DNA is one we've seen aired regularly on social media.The BBC asked three independent scientists about this. They said that the coronavirus vaccine would not alter human DNA.Some of the newly created vaccines, including the one now approved in the UK developed by Pfizer\\\/BioNTech, use a fragment of the virus's genetic material - or messenger RNA.\\\"Injecting RNA into a person doesn't do anything to the DNA of a human cell,\\\" says Prof Jeffrey Almond of Oxford University.It works by giving the body instructions to produce a protein which is present on the surface of the coronavirus.The immune system then learns to recognise and produce antibodies against the protein.This isn't the first time we've looked into claims that a coronavirus vaccine will supposedly alter DNA. We investigated a popular video spreading the theory back in May.Posts have noted that messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology \\\"has never been tested or approved before\\\".It is true that no mRNA vaccine has been approved before now, but multiple studies of mRNA vaccines in humans have taken place over the last few years. And, since the pandemic started, the vaccine has been tested on tens of thousands of people around the world and has gone through a rigorous safety approval process.Like all new vaccines, it has to undergo rigorous safety checks before it can be recommended for widespread use.In Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, vaccines are tested in small numbers of volunteers to check they are safe and to determine the right dose.In Phase 3 trials they are tested in thousands of people to see how effective they are. The group who received the vaccine and a control group who have received a placebo are closely monitored for any adverse reactions - side-effects. Safety monitoring continues after a vaccine has been approved for use.Bill Gates and microchip claimsNext, a conspiracy theory that has spanned the globe.It claims that the coronavirus pandemic is a cover for a plan to implant trackable microchips and that the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is behind it.There is no vaccine \\\"microchip\\\" and there is no evidence to support claims that Bill Gates is planning for this in the future.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told the BBC the claim was \\\"false\\\".Rumours took hold in March when Mr Gates said in an interview that eventually \\\"we will have some digital certificates\\\" which would be used to show who'd recovered, been tested and ultimately who received a vaccine. He made no mention of microchips.This led to one widely shared article headlined: \\\"Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus.\\\"The article makes reference to a study, funded by The Gates Foundation, into a technology that could store someone's vaccine records in a special ink administered at the same time as an injection.However, the technology is not a microchip and is more like an invisible tattoo. It has not been rolled out yet, would not allow people to be tracked and personal information would not be entered into a database, says Ana Jaklenec, a scientist involved in the study.The billionaire founder of Microsoft has been the subject of many false rumours during the pandemic.He's been targeted because of his philanthropic work in public health and vaccine development.Despite the lack of evidence, in May a YouGov poll of 1,640 people suggested 28% of Americans believed Mr Gates wanted to use vaccines to implant microchips in people - with the figure rising to 44% among Republicans.Fetus tissue claimsWe've seen claims that vaccines contain the lung tissue of an aborted fetus. This is false.\\\"There are no fetal cells used in any vaccine production process,\\\" says Dr Michael Head, of the University of Southampton.One particular video that was posted on one of the biggest anti-vaccine Facebook pages refers to a study which the narrator claims is evidence of what goes into the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. But the narrator's interpretation is wrong - the study in question explored how the vaccine reacted when introduced to human cells in a lab.Confusion may have arisen because there is a step in the process of developing a vaccine that uses cells grown in a lab, which are the descendants of embryonic cells that would otherwise have been destroyed. The technique was developed in the 1960s, and no fetuses were aborted for the purposes of this research.Many vaccines are made in this way, explains Dr David Matthews, from Bristol University, adding that any traces of the cells are comprehensively removed from the vaccine \\\"to exceptionally high standards\\\".The developers of the vaccine at Oxford University say they worked with cloned cells, but these cells \\\"are not themselves the cells of aborted babies\\\".The cells work like a factory to manufacture a greatly weakened form of the virus that has been adapted to function as a vaccine.But even though the weakened virus is created using these cloned cells, this cellular material is removed when the virus is purified and not used in the vaccine.Recovery rate claimsWe've seen arguments against a Covid-19 vaccine shared across social media asking why we need one at all if the chances of dying from the virus are so slim.A meme shared by people who oppose vaccination put the recovery rate from the disease at 99.97% and suggested getting Covid-19 is a safer option than taking a vaccine.To begin with, the figure referred to in the meme as the \\\"recovery rate\\\" - implying these are people who caught the virus and survived - is not correct.About 99.0% of people who catch Covid survive it, says Jason Oke, senior statistician at the University of Oxford.So around 100 in 10,000 will die - far higher than three in 10,000, as suggested in the meme.However, Mr Oke adds that \\\"in all cases the risks very much depend on age and do not take into account short and long-term morbidity from Covid-19\\\".It's not just about survival.

This is known as herd immunity - when a certain portion of the population have caught the virus.It's not just about survival. For every person who dies, there are others who live through it but undergo intensive medical care, and those who suffer long-lasting health effects.This can contribute to a health service overburdened with Covid patients, competing with a hospital's limited resources to treat patients with other illnesses and injuries.Concentrating on the overall death rate, or breaking down the taking of a vaccine to an individual act, misses the point of vaccinations, says Prof Liam Smeeth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It should be seen as an effort by society to protect others, he says.\\\"In the UK, the worst part of the pandemic, the reason for lockdown, is because the health service would be overwhelmed. Vulnerable groups like the old and sick in care homes have a much higher chance of getting severely ill if they catch the virus\\\".Satire or disinformation?While mainly associated with humour, memes can also carry negative messages on emotive subjects.Some of the most common memes about vaccines make it appear that a vaccine can have some radical side effects.Images of disfigured people or creatures are shared alongside claims that they show the \\\"first person to receive the vaccine\\\" or captions saying that the jab \\\"didn't even hurt\\\".It might seem obvious these images are not meant to be taken literally, but they are often shared in groups which are strongly opposed to vaccinations.It's true that vaccines can have side effects, but these are mostly mild such as a sore arm, headache or a raised temperature for a day or two.Vaccines go through rigorous safety checks before they can be administered to the public, with side effects closely monitored.When memes have been appearing on social media feeds for months, some people start questioning if there's anything to these false or baseless claims.\\\"Memes like these can be disarming, because they tap into fears we all have about trust in science and medication side effects\\\" says Joan Donovan, a lecturer at Harvard University, and an expert on disinformation.\\\"Tying together negative messaging to pop culture can be especially memorable and drive people to share because the meme is funny, outrageous, or sticky (memorable).\\\"Another widely shared group of memes links falsehoods about vaccines to freedom and individual liberties.One we've seen uses images of someone applying clown make-up, suggesting requirements for wearing a mask will be followed by an \\\"experimental vaccine\\\" and then an \\\"implantable microchip\\\".Other posts seek to downplay the risks of coronavirus and suggest there is an ulterior motive behind the development of a vaccine.Vaccines must meet a high standard of safety and effectiveness before they are approved for use - it's misleading to call them experimental.As for the microchip rumour, we've debunked that before.Another example suggests vaccines will lead to demands for people to surrender their firearms, and the confinement of people in \\\"virus relocation centres\\\". There is no evidence whatsoever to support these claims.A recent report looking at the online conversation about vaccines in English, French and Spanish, found that the theme of liberty and freedom was more common in English, and particularly in the US.Seb Cubbon, one of the co-authors of the report from anti-misinformation non-profit organisation First Draft, told the BBC this could be down to a number of factors, including America's political history and the relationship that citizens perceive they have with the state.\\\"As always, we should genuinely respect and appreciate people's views and opinions, such as the one that vaccines undermine personal freedoms\\\" he said.\\\"But the case can also be made that vaccines actually increase people's freedom to do things they otherwise wouldn't be able to, and can also contribute to safeguarding other people's personal freedoms too.\\\"Additional reporting by Olga Robinson and Marianna Spring."},{"author":"By Jack Goodman, Peter Mwai and Flora Carmichael","title":"Coronavirus: Fact-checking fake stories in Africa - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/53684037","content":"As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases across Africa passed the one million mark this week, we've looked into some of the widely shared fake news about the pandemic on the continent.Claim: Ghana's president has endorsed a conspiracy theory videoVerdict: FalseA voice recording endorsing various false conspiracies about the coronavirus pandemic has been attributed to the President of Ghana. We aren't sure who's speaking. It is a West African accent, but it is definitely not President Nana Akufo-Addo.Ghana's Information Minister has confirmed that the voice was not the president's and said the claim was \\\"obviously false\\\".The message makes various unsubstantiated claims about the origins of the virus, including the widely-shared false notion that the pandemic was a planned event, a so-called 'plandemic'.It also features false claims about mandatory vaccinations and the involvement of Bill Gates in manipulating events.We've previously written in detail about these compulsory vaccine rumours and the 'plandemic' conspiracy theory.Different versions of the clip have been circulated in Europe, North America and Africa.One, posted on a Nigerian YouTube channel, has clocked up more than 400,000 views.The man who runs the channel says he changed the title of the video to \\\"Africa Leader...Exposes Bill Gates Deadly Vaccine For Africa\\\" after people in the comments pointed out it inaccurately named the Ghanaian president.However, Nana Akufo-Addo's photograph is still showing.Claim: Drinking alcohol can ward off coronavirusVerdict: This false claim was intended as satire, but has been widely shared in Africa.A satirical video of a man's reaction to the re-imposition of an alcohol sale ban in South Africa on a TV news channel has been viewed thousands of times on Facebook and is also circulating on WhatsApp.The video has been edited to replace a senior representative of the Liquor Traders Association of South Africa (who was being interviewed), with a comedian.The comedian Thandokwakhe Mseleku posted the video of his television appearance on Instagram and YouTube.In the video, he says: \\\"Sanitiser has got 70% alcohol, so if you are drinking alcohol, it is like you are sanitizing your inside.\\\"Judging by some of the comments to the video, people clearly thought it was real.The comedian later labelled his videos as 'parody'. We have asked Thandokwakhe Mseleku for a comment.Drinking alcohol-based hand sanitiser is extremely dangerous and has led to deaths. It certainly doesn't protect you from coronavirus.Claim: Eating high-alkaline foods can eliminate the virusVerdict: False.A misleading poster claiming to offer advice from inside isolation hospitals on what to do to protect someone from coronavirus has been circulating on social media in Africa.It claims that the 'acidity' of the virus can be eliminated by consuming high-alkaline foods, and lists a variety of fruits with their apparent pH levels.The pH scale ranges from zero (very strong acids) to 14 (most alkaline). A pH of 7 is neutral.Some of the values in the shared poster are way off this scale: Avocados register 15.6 and Watercress 22.7. This is simply incorrect.But would alkaline foods kill the virus?Different parts of the body have different natural pHs which are naturally kept in balance and can't be changed through diet. For example, blood is very slightly alkaline, your stomach is acidic.So eating certain foods would not have an effect on the pH level inside cells.\\\"Given that it would be impossible to increase the pH of your cells, then it's a bit of a pointless argument to determine if high pH would inhibit the virus\\\", says Connor Bamford, a virologist at Queen's University Belfast.According to Lee Mwiti, Chief Editor, Africa Check, the spread of misinformation on WhatsApp is a particular challenge for fact checkers.The messaging app is hugely popular across the African continent, but as a closed platform it is hard to measure the spread of falsehoods and debunk them. He says Africa Check's work with 'tiplines' and podcasts means they are \\\"quite confident that it is a strong source of misinformation\\\".Claim: A coronavirus vaccine trial in Africa has led to the death of two childrenVerdict: False.When two French doctors controversially suggested on French TV in April that early vaccine trials should be conducted in Africa, their comments caused an uproar, including among some in the African diaspora.A London-based vlogger responded to the French doctors' comments by falsely claiming that vaccine trials were already under way in Guinea, and made the further false accusation that two children had died as a result.The video was illustrated with what was claimed to be a local news report showing unrest on the streets and interviews with sick children.In fact, the news report was from March 2019, before the coronavirus outbreak began, and the incident was not related to a vaccine.The Guinean health ministry put out a statement at the time which explained some people had experienced side-effects after being given an anti-parasitic drug treatment.According to officials interviewed in the report itself and local articles, there were no deaths reported from this treatment.The claims in the video first surfaced in May and were debunked at the time, but they have continued to circulate on Facebook and closed WhatsApp groups, and have been watched around 25,000 times on YouTube.Local fact checkers are working hard to debunk these and other false stories circulating online.Lee Mwiti from Africa Check says the most shared and enduring falsehoods are those that have tapped into people's anxieties, vulnerabilities and \\\"lack of control in a time of unprecedented disruption\\\".Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Coronavirus: Case rates in Devon and Cornwall - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-england-devon-55804222","content":"Here are the latest rates of cases of Covid-19 in Devon and Cornwall.The figures show the number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the seven days up to and including 15 April, with the week before shown in brackets for comparison.The breakdown of the figures by local authority area is:For comparison, the figure for England is 25.5.For a more detailed look at coronavirus where you live, use the BBC's postcode checker:The coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease known as Covid-19, was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January 2020.Figures were updated on 19 April and come from the government's coronavirus dashboard.Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

She said across pharmacies it had been a \\\"military operation\\\".However she said vaccine supply had been more limited in April than expected or wished.\\\"We have had to adjust our programme accordingly,\\\" she said.The over-35s are being offered the vaccine because of uptake among the over-40s.\\\"We know we have vaccinated many of them - over 120,000 - but what we have always found is that the enthusiasts come through pretty immediately, hovering over the booking line and others take a bit longer so we know those tend to be strung out over the number of weeks,\\\" she said.She said each cohort had had a similar pattern.'Seize this opportunity'Health Minister Robin Swann said: \\\"I have always been clear that we would move through the vaccine programme as quickly as vaccine deliveries and capacity allows as recommended by JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation).\\\"I recently announced that we successfully administered over one million vaccines across Northern Ireland to the highest priority groups.\\\"This figure is expected to rise exponentially as the Trust vaccine centres and GP practices continue to deliver second doses while the vaccine centre at the SSE Arena and the community pharmacists push ahead to deliver first doses.\\\"Opening up to 35-39 year olds earlier than expected is a testament to the hard work and dedication of all staff who are delivering the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland.\\\"I encourage those who are eligible to seize this opportunity and take up the offer of vaccination.\\\"Asking for patienceThe minister has also urged those aged between 40 and 45, who were recently added to the eligibility list, to book their vaccine appointment.He added: \\\"Getting the vaccine not only protects you but also those close to you.\\\"I would also strongly encourage anyone aged 40 years or over who hasn't booked themselves a vaccination appointment yet to do so as soon as possible.\\\"Meanwhile, the Department of Health also said that in line with recent advice from the JCVI, people living in the same house as someone who is severely immunosuppressed will be able to access the vaccine programme shortly, once their household has received a letter from their GP.Appointments at this stage are limited and the department is asking for patience."},{"author":"By Reality Check team","title":"Covid: Why was India not already on the red list? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/56801288","content":"India will be added to the government's travel-ban red list from Friday 23 April.It came after Boris Johnson cancelled his planned trip to the country because of the Covid situation there.India has been reporting more than 200,000 cases daily since 15 April.But Pakistan and Bangladesh have both been on the red list since 9 April.What is the red list?The red list is the government's list of 40 countries from which there are strict restrictions on travel to England.Northern Ireland has similar rules in place, while Scotland's are stricter and Wales does not currently have international flights arriving.The rules are designed to protect the UK from new variants of Covid, against which existing vaccines may be less effective.Travel to England is banned for anyone who has been in one of the countries in the past 10 days, except for UK citizens and residents, who have to isolate on arrival at government-approved hotels for 10 days.What are the criteria for going on the red list?The decision is based on Joint Biosecurity Centre risk assessments, which include:The first point on the list is particularly important, because the genome sequencing needed to identify new variants is very sophisticated and relatively rare.Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons on 9 February it was also important whether \\\"a variant of concern is the dominant variant\\\", adding the list was kept \\\"under review\\\".Why were Pakistan and Bangladesh put on the red list before India?Few cases of the South Africa variant found in the UK have come from Europe, according to the Department for Transport, with most coming from other parts of the world.But just because a country has found new variants, or has many cases of coronavirus, it will not necessarily be on the red list.On 13 April, the World Health Organization identified:Bangladesh, which had the South Africa but not the Brazil variant, and Pakistan, which had neither, were added to the red list on 9 April.But India, which had both, was not added for another two weeks.We asked the government why it wasn't added before but have not yet had a response.\\\"Nobody knows the full criteria - but there may be a political element because the UK wants a trade deal with India,\\\" Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology, at the University of Reading, said.\\\"It's not always a data-driven decision,\\\" he added, giving the example of Somalia, which is on the red list but has one of the lowest official rates of infection and deaths in the world.On 9 April:All three countries were seeing coronavirus cases rise.But the government says its travel bans are more about the transmission of variants of concern and a country's ability to monitor them.In late March, India's health authority said 771 variants of concern had been detected in a sample of almost 11,000 positive cases - a fraction of the millions of cases recorded in the country.But India has a greater sequencing ability than Pakistan or Bangladesh, although it is far behind the UK, which does about half of the world's sequencing.Announcing the decision to add India to the red list, Mr Hancock said the government had found 103 cases of a new variant - first identified in India.He said: \\\"the vast majority have links to international travel and have been picked up by our testing at the border\\\".What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Wales has administered the second dose to 24% of adults, driven by the prioritisation of vaccines to those working in the health and care sectors.There have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.Analysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a vaccine among five of the older age groups.The study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.In addition, vaccine take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.For example, 73% of those aged 50-54 in the poorest areas had been given a vaccine by 7 April, compared with 89% in the most affluent.Where are the vaccines coming from?The UK is now receiving doses of three vaccines approved by the medicine regulator.The Pfizer-BioNTech jab - the first to be given the green light in December - is being imported from Puurs, Belgium.A second vaccine, from Oxford University and AstraZeneca, is being made at a number of sites in Britain. Further doses are expected to come from the Serum Institute of India and the Halix plant in the Dutch city of Leiden.The third, from Moderna, is coming from sites in Switzerland and Spain, via Belgium.The UK is also lined up to receive at least three further vaccines if they are approved for use.A jab manufactured by US firm Novavax will be made in Stockton-on-Tees in north-east England, while another by French company Valneva will be made in Livingston, West Lothian, Scotland.The third, produced in the Netherlands by Belgian firm Janssen, owned by Johnson & Johnson, should also be available later this year.How will people be vaccinated?People will be vaccinated in three main ways, at:The government has urged the public to \\\"play their part\\\" in supporting \\\"the largest vaccination programme in British history\\\", including helping people attend their appointments.Some vaccine centres will close temporarily in April as supply shortages kick in, while others will stop taking bookings for first dose appointments.Is there enough vaccine?The UK has ordered more than 400 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines.Three have so far been approved for use: Oxford-AstraZeneca; Pfizer-BioNTech; and Moderna.The UK government has also announced an eighth deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants.It has placed an initial order for 50 million doses to be delivered later this year - if they are required.But there have been a number of challenges in what is called the vaccine \\\"supply chain\\\" - the logistics of how the jab gets from manufacturers to people.Getting enough supplies, checking those supplies are up to scratch and transporting vaccines according to their requirements have all thrown up difficulties.Will your vaccine appointment be the first time you have left home in a long while?

Small clusters or spikes in cases can lead to case rates rising or falling a little, but the overall picture shows them all very low.Public Health Wales (PHW) reminded people that coronavirus was still circulating and a large number of people have not been fully vaccinated.Merthyr Tydfil - which has been up and down since early March - is now at 14.9 cases per 100,000 people - its lowest level since August and a long way from its peak a week before Christmas when it stood at 1,349 cases per 100,000.A \\\"bit of a loss of discipline\\\" was blamed by health officials for the spike in March.Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly are in single figures, while Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) has seen its case rate dip under 20, its lowest point since the start of September.Cardiff had risen against the trend but is back below 30 cases per 100,000. It has not been above the 50 cases per 100,000 threshold since the end of February.Grangetown North in the city - with 15 positive tests in the past week - is still the highest localised hotspot in Wales on 167.3 cases per 100,000 but this is showing signs of a fall. There are 34 communities in England which are currently higher.Llanrumney North and Grangetown South are also above 100 cases per 100,000.Anglesey is the one Welsh county which has never risen above 200 cases per 100,000. After a rise last month, it is now in single figures, while Gwynedd although the highest in north Wales, is around 25.Denbighshire and Conwy are in single figures, while Wrexham - a small hotspot in Wrexham West - and Flintshire are around the Welsh average.There are only seven localised hotspots in Wales above 100 cases per 100,000.These are case rates broken down by community or what are known as middle layer super output areas (MSOAs).This splits Wales into 410 communities, each with a population of 7,000 on average.With low case numbers, these are now even more sensitive to local spikes and clusters.About 87% of these areas now have case numbers too low to register - fewer than three cases in the past week.Both Swansea and Neath Port Talbot recently experienced local hotspot spikes, blamed by health officials on people mixing indoors.These originated in the Clase and Briton Ferry areas, with Ravenhill still showing up as a hotspot, with 14 cases in the last week. Swansea has the highest case rate in Wales on 31.2 cases per 100,000. But, for context, it is the 96th highest in the UK and at its lowest point since mid-September.The case rate in Bridgend has fallen dramatically since it peaked just before Wales was put into a pre-Christmas lockdown on 20 December. It plunged to 7.5 cases per 100,000 and is now below 10.Torfaen has overtaken Monmouthshire is the lowest in Wales - just one positive test in the past week. This is the fourth lowest in the UK too.How many tests are positive?The proportion of positive tests, alongside the case rates, has been regarded as an important indicator on the road out of lockdown.The positivity rate in Wales on 19 April was 1.7%, the lowest point since 3 September.The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the positivity proportion of tests should be no more than 5% for a stable period before areas come out of restrictions.All areas are in single figures and for more than two weeks all have been within the 5% positivity threshold.On average, Wales has been below this threshold for 45 days. All local areas are within the \\\"circuit breaker\\\" thresholds for both positivity rate and case rate.Why do we now look at cases per 100,000 going back about five days?Because of a lag in test results coming back, PHW to give the most accurate data, publishes case rate figures going back to an earlier seven-day period.So, we wait for those late results to come in before looking at what the picture is - a bit like in football, waiting on a Saturday evening for all the final scores to come in before looking at the league tables.The case rate is only a snapshot of the virus out there as it relies on people asking for a test. There is recognition that some may be reluctant because they fear a loss of income due to self-isolation. Others may have the virus and not know it, as they are asymptomatic.But since the end of last summer, when tests were fully available to anyone who thought they might have Covid, it has been a good measure to look at how the virus is spreading.Before this testing phase, looking at case rates is far less reliable for reading into pandemic infections.The case rate in Wales for a period in December was one of the highest in the world. But it has been falling and has been the lowest rate of the UK nations for more than two months. At 15.9 cases per 100,000, it is at its lowest level since 3 September.How many people have been vaccinated?Nearly 1.7m people in Wales have been given a first dose of Covid vaccine, while 602,807 have now been given the full course.The latest day saw 7,165 people get a first dose and 1,349 were given a second.This is the lowest daily combined total for nearly two months.So far, 53.7% of the Welsh population have had a first dose and 19.1% have had a full vaccination.Vaccinations have also contributed to the estimate that one in two people in Wales have antibodies to help protect against Covid-19.That figure rises to more than three quarters of those in their 70s and more than two thirds of those in their 80s.The highest sees 79.7% of aged 65 to 69 having antibodies present.Blood samples are taken for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) survey, which looks at antibodies for those who have either had a Covid infection in the past or have recently had a vaccination dose.How many people are infected?ONS also estimates the numbers who may have infections, in a weekly survey.It takes throat and nose swab tests from hundreds of households in Wales.It suggests that 3,300 in Wales had Covid-19 in the two weeks to 10 April.This is one in 920 people - or 0.11%.Estimates range from one in 300 people in the Aneurin Bevan health board area to one in 560 people in Swansea Bay.Although small sample sizes, the survey also estimates 0.05% of 65-year-olds were infected, dropping to 0.03% of 70-year-olds.Similar surveys in the other UK nations all show a decrease too.The ONS also estimates that there were 0.7 Covid cases per 100,000 people per day in the week to 3 April in Wales\\u2026which would be around 230 new positive cases a day.How many people are in hospital with coronavirus?On 18 April, there were 295 Covid patients in hospital beds and the daily average (330) is the lowest since 24 September.Confirmed and suspected cases have seen a 60% drop in a month. This is a 94% drop from the record levels we saw in late December.A total of nine people were being treated on invasive ventilated beds, including in critical care, for confirmed or suspected coronavirus on 18 April, the lowest number since 9 September. This is 94% fewer Covid patients than in mid-January.On 18 April, admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases were running at a daily seven-day average of 16. Last week. an average of 15 wasthis is the lowest yet recorded in the pandemic.Fifteen confirmed and suspected Covid patients were admitted on Sunday. There were no Covid admissions in Cardiff and Vale, Swansea Bay or Hywel Dda hospitals.Covid admissions now make up 1.4% of all hospital admissions.What about infections in hospital?Public Health Wales has reported 32 hospital-acquired Covid infections in the most recent week. These include 14 \\\"probable\\\" and \\\"definite\\\" cases in north Wales hospitals. This is a 10 more in total than the previous week.In March, 49 cases were linked to an outbreak on five wards at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor..There have now been more than 2,100 hospital-acquired cases reported across Wales since the start of 2021 and nearly 7,000 since the pandemic began.Overall, 88% of Covid-19 infections occurred in the community - 12% were caught within hospitals.There is a particular challenge for hospitals, because of the nature of the virus and that it could be carried by asymptomatic patients and staff.How many deaths have there been?The number of deaths involving Covid-19 has fallen for the 11th week in a row in Wales - and is at its lowest weekly total since September.There were 15 deaths involving the virus, accounting for 3.1% of all deaths, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).This shows a continuing, steady decline and is 85% fewer Covid deaths than registered only a month ago.During the latest week, up to 2 April - there were five deaths in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area and four in Hywel Dda, with none across the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board region.When broken down by local authority area, there were no deaths involving Covid registered in eight counties: Bridgend, Caerphilly, Gwynedd, Merthyr Tydfil. Neath Port Talbot, Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT), Torfaen and Vale of Glamorgan.What about 'excess deaths'?So-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, are now below the five-year average for the fifth successive week.Looking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in a typical year is seen as a reliable measure of the pandemic.The number of deaths from all causes in Wales fell to 483 in the week ending 2 April. This was 182 deaths (27.4%) fewer than the five-year average.That below average proportion is greater in Wales than England and all its regions for this week.ONS said some caution is needed with interpreting this period because of the Easter holidays falling in different weeks over the years.When looking across the course of the pandemic so far, there have been 41,208 deaths from all causes, 7,812 mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate. This was 5,808 deaths above the five-year average.When deaths occurring up to 2 April but counting later registrations are included, the total number of deaths involving Covid rises to 7,819.We can see the two distinct waves of the pandemic in Wales.The second wave was more sustained - over nearly four months from late October to the end of February there were more than 4,800 deaths. The peak came on 11 January, when there were 83 deaths.The first wave over two months - March to May - brought more than 2,100 deaths. The peak came on 12 April with 73 deaths.Is there a Welsh hotspot?The hotspot was in the Aneurin Bevan health board area of south-east Wales in the early stages of the pandemic and then Cwm Taf Morgannwg.Over the summer, Betsi Cadwaladr health board, in north Wales, showed more of a spike in Covid-19 deaths compared with health boards in south Wales.In the second wave, the impact was more widespread. The peak in Bridgend in January saw the mortality rate rise to 1,277.8 deaths per 100,000 (159 deaths) and in December it was worst in Neath Port Talbot (962.8 deaths per 100,000, 117 deaths).We can also see the second wave was longer lasting in north Wales, right into February and March.When looking at crude death rates - based on local populations - Wales has four areas in the highest 20 across England and Wales.RCT has 366 deaths per 100,000 in total so far in the pandemic, the seventh-highest in England and Wales. Merthyr is on 344.8; Bridgend is 340.7 Neath Port Talbot also features.But none of these areas had any registered Covid deaths in the most recent week.Ceredigion, in the first wave of the pandemic was the second lowest behind the Isles of Scilly, now has the 21st-lowest death rate with 125.2 per 100,000. There are two Welsh counties below it, with Gwynedd the lowest in Wales and seventh lowest across England and Wales on 100.3 deaths per 100,000.The ONS has also broken down the deaths of those with Covid-19 into local areas - called middle layer super output areas, usually with average populations of around 7,000 people.We can see in the year since the pandemic began, Rhondda Cynon Taf has five communities in the highest 20 in Wales.This shows 57 deaths in Tonyrefail due to Covid being the worst, followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot (52) and Porth East in RCT (46 deaths).When we just look at February, the highest number was in Llanelli Bigyn in Carmarthenshire (14 deaths). There were also eight deaths in Chirk & Ceiriog Valley and Gresford, Marford & Rossett, both parts of Wrexham,; Llanishen in Cardiff and Porthcawl West in Bridgend.Around a quarter of communities when broken down like this had no deaths at all in February because of Covid.Two communities - Rhyl South West and Llandudno Junction South & Llasanffraid Glan Conwy - have registered no deaths at all due to Covid during the 12 months of the pandemic.What about deaths in care homes?There have been a total of 1,666 Covid-19 deaths in care homes up to 2 April, making up 21.3% of all coronavirus deaths in Wales.Meanwhile, Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW) compiles its own figures, which showed they have been notified of 8,669 deaths among adult care home residents, from all causes, since 1 March 2020.Of these, 1,920 deaths involving confirmed or suspected Covid, which makes up 22% of all reported deaths.The latest CIW report said numbers of deaths from all causes had gradually fallen since March and were below averages for 2019 and 2018. Although there had been a rise in recent days, they still remained below average.CIW is now updating its figures every two weeks.There was one care home death in Wales where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate in the latest ONS weekly total in Wales, the lowest number since September.What else can we tell?The ONS has published figures which suggest the mortality rate - when it is age standardised - is 1.3 times as high for Covid-19 deaths in Wales' poorest areas than its least deprived ones.There were 324.4 deaths per 100,000 population in February in the most deprived areas.This compares with 247 deaths in least deprived parts, according to the ONS figures.For the whole pandemic, up to the end of February, the 12-month mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales is 196.4 deaths per 100,000.That ranges from 299.2 for people living in the most deprived areas to 158.9 deaths per 100,000 for those living in the least deprived parts of Wales.Slightly higher, the mortality rate deaths involving Covid was 222.8 deaths per 100,000, compared to the UK average of 220.9.How do deaths from Covid-19 compare to other causes, like flu?Covid-19 was the biggest cause of death in Wales for the fourth successive month, ONS figures show.The virus accounted for 22.2% of all registered deaths in February, down from 35.2% the previous month.The age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid-19 fell for the first time since September, to 272.2 deaths per 100,000 people in Wales. It is the first significant fall since July.There were 3,199 deaths from all causes registered in February, which was 450 more deaths than in the same month in 2020 and 260 more deaths than the five-year average - so-called \\\"excess\\\" deaths.The overall mortality rate in Wales was 1,229.0 deaths per 100,000 people in February, which is against the pattern of falling mortality rates over the last 20 years and compares to the low of 1,042.1 deaths per 100,000 people seen in February 2020, a month before the pandemic began.For flu and pneumonia, there were 26 deaths per 100,000 - the ninth leading cause of death - down on the five-year average of 98 for February.Are deaths really 'due to' Covid-19?The ONS analysis finds that Covid-19 was the underlying cause of death in 84.1% of cases, where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate.A doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution.It was the underlying cause of death in 22.2% of all deaths in Wales in February, that is 711 deaths.Taking into account all deaths involving Covid increases the proportion to 26.4% of all deaths - 845 - in Wales.Who is being tested in Wales?Around 3.15m tests had been carried out by 11 April, including 1.39 million on key workers and care home residents.There were 60,915 tests in the most recent week, nearly 20% down on the week before. This is half of the testing we saw in the week before Christmas and an indication of far fewer people presenting themselves with symptoms and the impact of the vaccination programme.That total figure includes nearly 30,000 care home residents and workers tested routinely during the week. This is a steady number each week, so the numbers presenting themselves with symptoms for tests will be far fewer.Wales has access to 37,000 laboratory tests per day currently if required, with about 15,000 of this capacity at NHS Wales labs.A total of 38,774 people in their 20s have also tested positive - only 86 more (a 0.2% rise) on last week's figure. That age group makes up just over 18% of all positive tests.The most recent analysis of tests amongst university students found one case in the last seven days.Separate figures, now published weekly, show 80.4% of schools have been affected by the virus since September.There have been 4,467 cases in staff and 5,859 in pupils from September, up to 14 April.There were 52 new cases in staff and pupils in the last week - another fall - and 331 over the last three weeks.We can also see from more detailed PHW figures how many different key workers and others have been tested - and how speedily results are coming back.What about testing in care homes?There were just 37 positive tests in elderly care homes in Wales in the most recent week, the lowest recorded since the re-start of the routine weekly testing programme in September.Back in early January, the number hit 1,500 in the peak week.Care home testing of elderly residents is continuing on scientific advice, despite the vaccination programme having now given full doses to more than 83% of residents and three quarters of staff.Across Wales, around 28,700 residents and staff were tested in the week beginning 5 April, as part of the weekly testing regime.The vast majority of test processing from care homes is done by Lighthouse labs but their results do not distinguish between residents and staff. There were 31 (0.12%) positive tests results from these labs from 25,056 tests.From the other tests processed by NHS labs, we can see 2,283 care home residents were tested and just six (0.3%) were positive.The number of care home workers who tested positive has been supressed from this week's data. Numbers have been in single figures so it is likely to be none or very few.Care Home Inspectorate Wales also publishes separate figures around testing. They show only 14 (1.3%) of care homes in Wales had notified one or more positive cases in staff or residents in the past week - down from 31 (3%) in the previous week and by far the lowest number since the figures started being published in December. More than half of local authority areas had no cases.Only 53 (5%) of care homes had notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in staff or residents, in the past 20 days. It was 16.5% a month ago.No Covid death has been notified since 26 March.What about tracing contacts?The drop in tests and cases in turn means fewer people to trace - 57% fewer cases and 61% fewer contacts than a month ago.The \\\"test, trace, protect\\\" system for contacting people with coronavirus and tracing contacts has been seeing an improvement in speed, albeit with smaller numbers in recent weeks.Just 579 positive cases that were eligible for follow-up in Wales in the most recent week, and 99% were reached, with 95% reached within 24 hours of referral to the contact tracing system and 98% were reached within 48 hours.This equates to 96% of those successfully reached being reached within 24 hours and 99% within 48 hours.It's estimated that 10% of contacts of an infected person develop Covid. Of the 1,404 close contacts that were eligible for follow-up, 92% were reached within 24 hours.What are the differences between measures?The ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way - and information is available at different times so do not expect to see the same thing.The data is revised and PHW refines and verifies it and then each individual death is assigned to the date it happened.Can we compare the two sets of figures?The graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from all the different data sources - and how there is a difference between ONS and PHW and also between ONS and the UK Government count, which is of people who died within 28 days of a first positive test for Covid.There is a difference of about 2,270 deaths.The daily PHW figures here are presented as a rolling average, not as the day they are first reported as these can be incomplete.By 14 April, there was an average of 1.4 deaths a day - down from a peak of 48 deaths averaging on 3 January and the lowest since late September.No deaths occurred on 20 March - the first day this has happened since 24 September. There have been no further deaths occurring on seven other days since.There were 58 deaths occurring on 1 January, the highest daily figure in the pandemic. The 13 worst days for deaths occurring, as reported by PHW, were during the second wave in late-December and January."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Covid-19: India to be added to travel 'red list' and AJ Tracey gig organisers fined - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-56803137","content":"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.1. India to be added to travel 'red list'India is to be added to the \\\"red list\\\" of countries from which most travel to the UK is banned, over concerns about a new Covid variant circulating there. From 04:00 BST on Friday, British or Irish passport holders who have been in India in the previous 10 days will have to quarantine in a government-approved hotel, while all other arrivals will be refused entry. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there had been 103 cases of the variant first found in India detected in the UK, and health officials are investigating whether it spreads more easily or is resistant to vaccines. It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson cancelled a trip to India, due to take place next Monday, amid rising cases in the country.2. More than 10m fully vaccinated in UKMore than 10 million people in the UK have received their second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to the latest government figures. It means more than 19% of UK adults are now fully vaccinated, while nearly 33 million people have had a first dose. Hailing the \\\"terrific milestone\\\", Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged those eligible to get the jab \\\"as soon as possible\\\". Meanwhile, the UK recorded four deaths within 28 days of a positive test - the lowest daily figure since 7 September, although the number of deaths recorded on Mondays and over the weekend tend to be lower because of reporting delays.3. Study to reinfect young people with CovidHealthy young people who have had Covid-19 are being asked to volunteer for a trial that will deliberately expose them to the virus. The experts behind the study, beginning this month, want to see how the immune system copes second time round. The ultimate aim is to design better treatments and vaccines. Up to 64 people aged 18-30 will spend 17 days in a quarantine unit at a hospital suite and have numerous tests, including lung scans.4. HSBC bosses to hot-desk in post-pandemic shake-upBanking giant HSBC has confirmed that top managers in its Canary Wharf headquarters have lost their offices and will have to hot-desk on an open-plan floor. The move comes as HSBC pursues plans to shrink its office space by 40% in a post-pandemic shake-up. The company's chief executive said the bank would move to a \\\"hybrid working model\\\", allowing most staff to work part-time from home on a permanent basis.5. Organisers fined £10k for AJ Tracey gigOrganisers of an AJ Tracey gig, cancelled shortly before it was due to take place in Manchester, have been fined £10,000 for breaching Covid rules. The rapper said he didn't expect so many people to turn up at Platt Fields Park on Sunday. The event was axed before he performed because of the large crowds that had gathered.Get a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.And don't forget...Find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.If you're wondering how worried we should be about new Covid variants, we've explained the basics here.What questions do you have about coronavirus?In some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Northern Ireland has given first doses to 45.6%.The UK nations have converged on numbers of first doses. The daily rate has pushed up again in Wales, as the programme reaches out to those in the 40 and 30-year-old age groups, as well as completing first doses for those in their 50s.What is happening with second doses?The total number of people having the full vaccine course in Wales now stands at 602,807 (19.1%).Wales had regularly been ahead of the other UK nations in terms of its daily average of second doses, but the UK nations have converged here too.Data also shows England, Northern Ireland and Scotland have vaccinated between 13.9% and 15.1% of their populations.England has been averaging more than 311,000 second doses a day as the programme there has pushed forward in the past week.What about different parts of Wales?We get a series of weekly figures from PHW which now break down figures by local authority, as well as health board - with the latest going up to 11 April.The latest set shows:When looking at vaccinations by local authority:Lag in the figuresWe have to bear in mind the vaccine figures published in Wales, unlike in England, are not \\\"real time\\\".It takes up to five days after a person receives a dose for the data to be actually published.GPs are asked to input data into the NHS Wales-built system as soon as possible but it then has to be verified and quality assured by PHW - to ensure people are not double-counted, for instance - before it is actually published.So there is a built-in lag between what health bosses are seeing happening daily and when we see the figures.One health official said they were under-reporting rather than leaving \\\"any chance of over-reporting\\\".Ministers however, do have access to \\\"real-time\\\" data as soon as it is in the system so have an idea what is going on, on the ground."},{"author":"By Philippa Roxby","title":"Covid: When will I get the vaccine? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/health-55045639","content":"About 33 million people in the UK have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine and 10 million a second dose.Adults under 30 are being offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca jab because of evidence possibly linking it to rare blood clots.Can pregnant women get the vaccine?The advice for pregnant women has been updated.UK vaccine advisers now say they should be offered a Covid jab when other people their age get one.The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are preferable, they say, because data relating to 90,000 pregnant women has not raised any safety concerns. Data on how the AZ vaccine works in pregnant women may be available in the near future.Who is being offered the vaccine now?In England, people aged 45 and over are being invited and can book online. Text messages with a link to the national booking service, which can also be called on 119, will also start to go out this week.Over-50s are being offered the vaccine in Scotland. Unpaid carers in Scotland aged 16-64 can register online to get the vaccine, or call 0800 030 8013.The Welsh government says all over-50s have now been offered their first dose.In Northern Ireland, people aged 35 and over are now eligible. They can book online or call 0300 200 7813.Across the UK, people over 16 who live with adults with weakened immune systems will also be offered a vaccine.The government insists all adults will be offered their first dose - in decreasing age order - by the end of July.Some groups at higher risk of needing hospital treatment from Covid are urged to take up the offer of vaccination promptly:Who has already been offered a first dose?Those most at risk from Covid and those caring for them were vaccinated first:All four nations of the UK follow these priorities, but the rollout varies between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.When will I get my second dose?Everyone should be offered a second vaccine dose within 12 weeks of the first jab to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19.During April, about 12 million second doses are being offered to people in priority groups.First doses offered daily are now being overtaken by second jabs.Are two doses needed?The approved vaccines require two doses to provide the best protection.In the UK, people were initially told they would get a second dose three to four weeks after the first. But to ensure a faster rollout of first doses, the UK's chief medical officers extended the gap to 12 weeks.The World Health Organization says this also increases the AstraZeneca vaccine's effectiveness.What jab might I get and can I mix and match vaccines?People under the age of 30 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, after a review into a possible link with extremely rare blood clots in adults.But the UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for most people.Official guidance says everyone should get the same vaccine for both doses. In very rare circumstances - if only one vaccine is available, or it's not known which was given for the first dose - a different vaccine can be used.If you have already had a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, you should also have a second dose.Only those who suffered a rare blood clot after the first dose should not, the regulator says.A UK trial is currently investigating whether using two different vaccines for the first and second doses could give better protection and more flexibility.Do the vaccines work against new variants?All three vaccines have been shown to be effective at preventing people from becoming seriously ill and dying from Covid.The AstraZeneca vaccine offers a good level of protection against the \\\"Kent\\\" variant now dominant in the UK. Early research on other vaccines, including Pfizer, suggest they also offer protection.There are concerns the vaccines may not work as well against variants first spotted in South Africa and Brazil, and some UK variants too. But developers are updating their jabs to target the new variants, and plan to have them ready by the autumn.They are likely to be offered as a routine booster for some groups.How many vaccine doses are there?The UK has ordered seven vaccines and expects to receive 407 million doses - more than enough for every adult to receive two.Will children be vaccinated?Covid vaccines are being trialled for children by most companies. Pfizer has released early data which suggests children aged 12-15 are well protected, with no unusual side effects.AstraZeneca has halted its trial involving 300 participants aged six to 17 while the UK's medicines regulator investigates a possible link with rare blood clots in adults.In the UK, the Pfizer vaccine is currently approved for use in over-16s and the AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines in over-18s.Getting a Covid vaccine is not compulsory because experts say this wouldn't help create public confidence. But making it mandatory for NHS staff and care workers is being considered.What about people with allergies?A very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction - known as anaphylaxis - when vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine.You should discuss any serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated.Most people will not be affected in any way, although mild side-effects are possible."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Covid: Rebuilding Wales' NHS 'could be bigger challenge than pandemic' - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-wales-56775478","content":"Rebuilding the NHS after Covid could be a bigger challenge than the pandemic itself, leading doctors have said.Surgeons say a \\\"radical rethink\\\" of the way hospitals work is needed, while doctors said tackling backlogs would be a \\\"huge challenge\\\" for exhausted staff.Meanwhile, cancer charities fear the disruption will lead to a surge in deaths, particularly in Wales.They all agree getting the NHS back on its feet will be the biggest challenge faced by an incoming Welsh government.Amid these warnings, academics said difficult choices would have to be made on where money was spent.BBC Wales health correspondent Owain Clarke has been looking at some of the key health issues facing whoever wins the Senedd election on 6 May.Richard Pugh, head of Macmillan Cancer Support in Wales, said places like his Rhymney hometown recorded some of Wales' highest coronavirus case rates.Mr Pugh said that happened because \\\"huge\\\" inequalities already existed.In communities like his, in Caerphilly county, Mr Pugh said \\\"we all know each other\\\".\\\"I could point to you people's houses where sadly they've lost someone because of Covid,\\\" he said.\\\"When we lose one of us we lose something about the community itself.\\\"Mr Pugh has lived in the town all of his life.\\\"Unfortunately we're top of the wrong leagues all the time, for example diabetes and cancer,\\\" he said.\\\"Here and in the other coalfield areas we have been hit the hardest and are still being hit the hardest.\\\"Health inequalities in this community are huge.\\\"That problem remained unsolved when the pandemic \\\"came on top of that\\\".\\\"We've got to look at ourselves about that,\\\" Mr Pugh said.Covid in the Rhymney area - in figures'I can barely walk 30 yards. My pain levels are at nine'Waiting lists for other NHS treatments have grown massively because of the priority given to coronavirus.Arthritis patient Christine Evans has been on an NHS waiting list for 15 months.The 67-year-old said the condition of her right knee had left her \\\"barely [able to] walk 30 yards\\\".Ms Evans, who works in healthcare, said she was thinking of going private, which would cost about £15,000.She said: \\\"When I went to see the consultant, I would have said on a scale of one to 10 my pain level was around about six or seven.\\\"I was able to walk perhaps 100 yards, which is not too bad.\\\"Now we're 15 months down the line and I can barely walk 30 yards. And my pain levels are ranking up around about a nine.\\\"Ms Evans, from Llanharry, in Rhondda Cynon Taf, said it was \\\"pretty awful\\\".\\\"You get up in the morning, you think: 'Oh, can I face today?'\\\"She said she felt for consultants.\\\"They're normally able to step up to the plate and help us, and they just can't,\\\" she said.'Absolutely exhausted'Helen Whyley, director of the Royal College of Nursing in Wales, urged those needing care who were \\\"not wanting to bother the NHS\\\" to seek advice from health practitioners such as their GP.\\\"We know there are challenges about reopening services, but we also need to understand and make sure that we've got everyone who needs care at least on the list waiting for it, so that we can put those plans together,\\\" she said.After going into the pandemic with a shortage of nurses, then adding extra services such as the vaccination programme, she said there was a \\\"massive challenge\\\" ahead for staff.\\\"Many of them are absolutely exhausted, so our current workforce also needs to get its breath back in addition to get going on the things that we always used to do,\\\" she said.\\\"The next Welsh government needs to be really strong, really brave and take the opportunity to look at the whole system.\\\"Mountain Ash GP Dr Kamila Hawthorne said the backlog facing the NHS was a \\\"huge problem\\\".\\\"We're going to need to give much clearer instructions to patients as to what to do if, while they're waiting, anything else happens which might mean that their condition is getting worse,\\\" she told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\\\"It's very worrying really that conditions that in the past you knew would be seen as secondary care within, say eight weeks' time, now might take easily a year.\\\"In January more 500,000 people in Wales were on waiting lists.There has been an eight-fold increase in those waiting longer than nine months.The backlog could take years to clear.Where next for the NHS?The Royal College of Surgeons' Wales director, Richard Johnson, said the NHS needed a \\\"radical rethink\\\".\\\"We should be developing Covid-light sites on a regional basis,\\\" he said.\\\"So you've got hospitals, where there's no emergency patients going in there, dedicated to treating the backlog of patients.\\\"We know from experience it's very easy to turn services off, but it's far more difficult to bring them back online again.\\\"The new government is likely to be under pressure to bring down waiting lists fast.The Royal College of Physicians' Olwen Williams said more doctors were needed and those already in place needed to \\\"refresh and renew themselves\\\".\\\"We have come to a point in the pandemic when everyone's taking a deep breath and thinking 'what's next'.\\\" she said.Recruiting more staff will not be enough, according to Dr Williams.She said: \\\"A lot of us really do believe that we have to look at really doing things that have got value, and leaving aside some of the things we have done in the past, and think, 'does this person really need to be seen by 10 different clinicians, could they not be seen by one?'.\\\"According to Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre, the Welsh government gave NHS Wales an extra £1.4bn in the last financial year to deal with the pandemic.That was down to extra money that came to Wales due to increased NHS spending in England.But much more funding is likely to be needed to help the NHS recover.\\\"You are looking at an extremely challenging picture for the next Welsh government,\\\" said Guto Ifan, a research associate at the centre.There were the direct costs of Covid, test and trace, and potentially re-vaccinations.\\\"Also the indirect costs of Covid-19 are probably more substantial beyond this year,\\\" Mr Ifan said.\\\"If NHS productivity doesn't recover because of social distancing requirements and heightened infection control, that means the NHS can deliver less care for the resources it's given.\\\"Where will the cash come from?The new Welsh government will have about a billion pounds unallocated for 2021-22.This is partly because Wales sourced personal protective equipment and introduced Test, Track and Protect more cheaply than in England.\\\"Whichever party or parties form the next Welsh government, they'll all be hoping and wishing the UK government changes course on its spending plans,\\\" said Mr Ifan.\\\"With that money carried forward from last year to this year,the Welsh government will be in a position to meet NHS funding pressures this year.\\\"But it's next

decision had been \\\"difficult but vital\\\" said Health Secretary Matt Hancock.Which countries are on the red list?The changes mean there are 40 countries on the government's red list of countries from which travel is banned:Countries can be added to the list with just a few hours' notice.What are the hotel quarantine rules?If someone has been in or through any red-list countries in the previous 10 days, they will be refused entry to the UK.An exception is made for British or Irish passport holders - or people with UK residence rights - but they must first pay to quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days.In England, this costs £1,750 per passenger travelling alone, to cover transport, tests, food and accommodation.Every additional adult, or child over 12, must pay £650, while children aged five to 12 pay £325.They must also have proof of a negative coronavirus test to enter the UK.Rule-breakers face strict penalties - including prison sentences of up to 10

This is the lowest number since 9 September and is 94% fewer Covid patients than in mid-January.Cardiff and Vale had four critical care Covid patients, there were three in Betsi Cadwaladr and one each in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Swansea Bay.

Their contacts have been traced and asked to isolate.Information on what to do is on the local authority websites:People living in certain parts of SE16 in the London Borough of Southwark are also being contacted - after a case linked to the Lambeth\\\/Wandsworth cluster was identified.Surge testing linked to the South Africa variant is also taking place in parts of:What are the new variants?There are many thousands of different versions, or variants, of Covid circulating - including the Brazilian, South African and UK \\\"variants of concern\\\".These strains of Covid-19 may be more contagious and dodge immunity to some extent.An Indian variant is also being investigated by health officials in the UK.What are the different types of coronavirus test?The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testThe PCR test involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis.It is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result.People tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered PCR tests.The lateral flow testThis also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid. The solution is then added to a test strip which shows a result in 20-30 minutes.How do I get tested?Wherever you are in the UK, if you have symptoms you should book a free test online. You will be sent to a testing site or have a testing kit sent to your home.If you have problems booking, call 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0300 303 2713 in Scotland.Anyone in England can now get two free lateral flow tests each week - even if they do not have symptoms.What happens if I test positive?Anyone who gets a positive result test must immediately self-isolate for at least 10 days. NHS Test and Trace will tell their contacts to isolate if necessary.Self-isolating means not leaving home for exercise or even to buy food, medicines or other essentials.People in England who fail to self-isolate after a positive test can be fined up to £10,000.Anyone on a low income who has been told to self-isolate can claim a £500 payment.Correction 2 March: A version of this story published on 1 March said that testing for variants was being carried out in the CM0 area around Southminster. It was in fact the CM13 area around Brentwood where additional testing was taking place."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Covid: More than 10m people fully vaccinated in UK - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-56794047","content":"More than 10 million people in the UK have received a second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to the latest government figures.It means more than 19% of UK adults are now fully vaccinated, while nearly 33 million people have had their first dose.Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the news as a \\\"remarkable milestone\\\".Also hailing the \\\"terrific milestone\\\", the health secretary urged people to get the jab \\\"as soon as possible\\\".\\\"Second doses are crucial to maximising the strength and duration of your protection from Covid-19,\\\" he added.Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said: \\\"The success of the NHS vaccination programme is not a happy accident. It is down to careful planning coupled with the sheer hard work and determination of doctors, nurses and countless other staff ably assisted by volunteers and many others.\\\"It comes as the UK recorded four deaths within 28 days of a positive test - the lowest daily figure since 7 September, although the number of deaths recorded on Mondays and over the weekend tend to be lower because of reporting delays.There were also 2,963 new cases, according to the latest government figures.Mr Hancock told the Commons the government was \\\"on track\\\" to offer a first dose to all adults in the UK by the end of July and uptake had been \\\"astonishingly high\\\", at 94% for over-50s.However, he said the vaccination rate for care home staff was currently below 80% in more than half of all local authority areas. As a result, he said, the government had launched a consultation into whether care home providers for older adults should only deploy workers who have received their Covid jab, unless they have a medical exemption.People aged 45 and over are now being offered the vaccine in England and Scotland. In some areas of Wales 40-49 year-olds are being invited, while in Northern Ireland vaccine appointments are now being made available to a limited number of 35-39 year olds.The rollout will continue to prioritise groups by age, according to advice from the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).The 10 million mark for second doses is a great milestone.But the rapid acceleration in second doses has come at a cost to first doses - and this spells trouble for the government's ambition to offer every adult in the UK a jab by the end of July.Currently the UK is doing just over 100,000 first doses a day on average, that is down from 500,000 a month ago.There was always going to be some drop-off. But on that trajectory just over half of under-50s will get a first dose by the end of July.Take-up is predicted to be lower in the younger age groups than it has been in the older ones so that shortfall may not be as bad as it first looks.What is more, there is the hope vaccine supplies will increase. More doses of Moderna may become available, while there is hope the Novavax jab, which is being made in the UK, could come into play in May.Nonetheless, it is another reminder that the vaccine programme still has many hurdles to cross.It comes after the government said all over-50s and those in high-risk groups in the UK had been offered a first dose.Earlier this month the UK began to roll out the Moderna vaccine, alongside the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech jabs.All under-30s in the UK will be offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca jab due to evidence linking it to rare blood clots.Meanwhile, Mr Hancock announced that India would be added to the travel red list from 04:00 BST on Friday. It means anybody who is not a UK or Irish resident or British citizen cannot enter the UK if they have been in India in the last 10 days and any other arrivals will need to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days.Earlier, the prime minister cancelled a trip to India, which had been due to take place on 26 April, amid rising cases there.Health officials in the UK are investigating whether a variant first found in India spreads more easily or is resistant to treatments or vaccines.Mr Hancock said there had now been 103 cases of this variant detected in the UK, with the vast majority linked to international travel.He said there had also been 557 cases of the variant first found in South Africa detected in the UK since December.The health secretary said the government was \\\"ramping up\\\" plans for a booster shot to ensure vaccines stayed \\\"ahead of the virus\\\".\\\"We will be working with our current vaccine suppliers and new suppliers, like the CureVac partnership, to work out which vaccines will be effective as a booster shot and to design new vaccines specifically targeted at the variants of concern,\\\" he added."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Covid: Delhi announces lockdown as India's cases surge - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-india-56798248","content":"India's capital, Delhi, has announced a week-long lockdown after a record spike in cases overwhelmed the city's healthcare system.Government offices and essential services, such as hospitals, pharmacies and grocers, will be open during the lockdown, which starts on Monday night.The city had imposed a weekend curfew, but reported its highest single-day spike so far on Sunday - 24,462 cases.India has been reeling from a deadly second wave since the start of April.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the city had almost run out of beds at hospital intensive care units (ICUs) and that oxygen was in short supply.\\\"I have always been against lockdowns, but this one will help us amplify the number of hospital beds in Delhi,\\\" he told a virtual press conference on Monday.He also appealed to the city's migrant workers not to leave - last year's national lockdown saw millions of them heading back to their villages after they found themselves unemployed and running out of money.\\\"This was a difficult decision to take but we had no other option left,\\\" Mr Kejriwal said. \\\"I know when lockdowns are announced, daily-wage workers suffer and lose their jobs.

Mr Johnson and Mr Modi will speak later this month to \\\"launch ambitious plans for the future partnership\\\", a statement said.UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock also announced on Monday afternoon that India had been placed on the country's travel red list, which means people who have been in India in the last 10 days cannot enter the UK.Former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has been admitted to hospital after testing positive for the virus, Indian media report.Maharashtra, which has India's financial hub Mumbai as its capital, remains the worst-hit state, accounting for nearly a third of India's more than 1.9 million active cases.But Delhi is the worst-hit city, confirming more cases daily than Mumbai in recent days.Hospitals are struggling to accommodate Covid-positive patients in Delhi and other badly hit cities such as Mumbai, Lucknow and Ahmedabad. Several states have been reporting an acute shortage of beds in Covid wards and ICUs.Even test results are being delayed because of overwhelming demand, which, doctors say, is leading to people not getting diagnosed and treated in time.Experts say the Indian government ignored warnings of a second wave and did little to prevent it or even contain it - they point to cricket matches attended by unmasked crowds, massive election rallies that appeared to flout basic Covid safety rules, and a huge Hindu festival where millions congregated on the banks of the Ganges river earlier this month to take a holy dip.Buoyed by a sharp dip in case numbers and the start of the vaccination drive, India began the year on what appeared to be a normal note. But things soon took a turn for the worse as people began leaving home more, wearing masks less and socialising in larger groups. The entry of variants and a lag in the vaccination drive only drove up infections further, experts say.Within weeks, India shot to the top of the world's Covid chart, recording more cases daily than any other country."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Namibian court denies entry to gay couple's surrogate daughters - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-africa-56800752","content":"A Namibian court has refused to issue a gay man emergency travel documents so that he can bring home his twin daughters from South Africa where they were born by surrogate.The authorities say Phillip Lühl must show genetic proof that he is their father before they can travel.Mr Lühl, 38, and his Mexican husband Guillermo Delgado say this is discriminatory.Both fathers' names are on the babies' birth certificates.Mr Lühl, a university lecturer and Namibian citizen, has argued that the paternity test being demanded of him would not be required from a single mother or heterosexual couple.He told the BBC his daughters were currently \\\"stateless\\\", and previously told AFP that Namibia's refusal amounted to \\\"state-sanctioned homophobia\\\".Sexual contact between males is forbidden in Namibia but the law is rarely enforced.Neighbouring South Africa meanwhile - where the couple got married - was the first country in the world to use its constitution to outlaw discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation back in 1996.Mr Delgado is in Namibia with the couple's two-year-old son, while Mr Lühl is stuck in Johannesburg with the girls who are five weeks old.The BBC's Nomsa Maseko in Johannesburg says more details of the Namibian judge's ruling are to be made public later on Monday.Namibia's government said in March that the home affairs minister \\\"did not agree to a request to issue the twins Namibian travel documents, because their entitlement to Namibian citizenship by descent had not been determined\\\".Mr Lühl says he was told he did not follow the correct application, and accuses the Namibian authorities of a \\\"cop-out with technicalities\\\".Before Windhoek High Court's ruling on Monday, LGBTQ activists had decried the government's stance and a number of Mr Lühl's supporters took part in street protests a month ago.He spoke of his frustration at the time from South Africa:The couple have another ongoing case in Namibia, where they are seeking citizenship for their two-year-old son, born to the same surrogate in South Africa.They say there is a possibility they will appeal against the judgement once it has been reviewed by their lawyers.Mr Lühl told the BBC that he and his family might consider giving up their life in Namibia and moving away if they lose in the courts, saying that the country is not as \\\"progressive\\\" and \\\"free and equal\\\" as it likes to think it is.\\\"The narrative of inclusivity being peddled at the highest levels really is not the case.\\\"You may also be interested in:"},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Russia moves ailing Putin critic Navalny to prison hospital - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-56800642","content":"Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been moved to a prison hospital, where the authorities say his condition is \\\"satisfactory\\\".He has been on hunger strike for 20 days, complaining of inadequate medical attention. He is now in Vladimir, a city 180km (112 miles) east of Moscow.The FSIN prison service says he is being examined by a doctor daily and he has agreed to take vitamins.Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent last August and only narrowly survived.After his transfer to intensive care in Berlin, toxicologists concluded that the poison was Russian weapons-grade Novichok.Western governments blamed the Russian state for the attack, and Navalny blamed President Vladimir Putin directly. The Kremlin denied any involvement and disputed the conclusion about Novichok.The prison service said doctors had decided to move Navalny on Monday to a hospital in Penal Colony No 3 in the city of Vladimir. He was transferred from the Pokrov penal colony, which is about 80km closer to Moscow.Crackdown warningRussia's Interior Ministry has now warned the population against holding any pro-Navalny street protests. There were thousands of arrests at such protests in January.Navalny supporters have called for rallies on Wednesday - the day of a state-of-the-nation speech by President Putin.\\\"Any aggressive actions by participants in unauthorised public meetings, especially attempts to provoke clashes with law enforcement officials, will be regarded as a threat to public safety and immediately suppressed,\\\" the ministry said.Navalny's doctors warned he would \\\"die within the next few days\\\" if not given urgent medical attention for acute back pain and leg numbness.He started a hunger strike on 31 March in protest at not being able to see his own medical team. His doctors say recent blood test results indicate he could suffer kidney failure and go into cardiac arrest at any moment.Earlier, the US warned Russia there would be \\\"consequences\\\" if Navalny, 44 - the most prominent critic of President Putin - were to die in jail.The UK, France, Germany and the European Union also expressed their concern over his treatment and demanded his release.Navalny was jailed in February for old embezzlement charges, which he claims are politically motivated.The European Court of Human Rights found violations of justice in the case against him.Four doctors, including his personal physician, Anastasia Vasilyeva, wrote to prison officials requesting to see Navalny urgently.In the letter, which Dr Vasilyeva posted on Twitter, the experts said Navalny's potassium had reached \\\"critical levels\\\".\\\"This means both impaired renal function and that serious heart rhythm problems can happen any minute,\\\" it explained.Having blood potassium levels higher than 6.0 mmol (millimoles) per litre usually requires immediate treatment. Navalny's blood test results, which were obtained by his lawyers, showed his were at 7.1, the letter said.The doctors urged prison officials to let them examine Navalny immediately, \\\"taking into account the blood tests and his recent poisoning\\\".In an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr recorded on Friday but aired on Sunday, Russia's ambassador to Britain, Andrei Kelin, said Navalny was not in danger.\\\"Of course he will not be allowed to die in prison, but I can say that Mr Navalny behaves like a hooligan absolutely in trying to violate every rule that has been established,\\\" he said.Ambassador Kelin added that Navalny, who is serving a two-and-a-half-year jail term, would be released earlier if \\\"he will behave normally\\\".Last week Navalny's wife Yulia said her husband now weighed 76kg (168 pounds) - down 9kg since starting his hunger strike.Alexander Polupan, who was one of the doctors to treat Navalny after the poisoning, posted an image of his blood test results, and said they were an \\\"absolute indication\\\" that he needed urgent medical care or he would \\\"die within the next days\\\".International pressureMeanwhile, more than 70 well-known writers, artists and academics, signed a letter calling on President Putin to ensure adequate medical care for Navalny.The letter was published in The Economist and France's Le Monde newspaper, and included the signatures of Hollywood actors Jude Law, Ralph Fiennes and Benedict Cumberbatch, Harry Potter author JK Rowling and director Ken Burns.US President Joe Biden told reporters on Saturday that Navalny's medical treatment was \\\"totally unfair and totally inappropriate\\\".

The Czech government is now considering further measures, he said, one option being to permanently reduce Russia's embassy staffing in Prague.Before the latest expulsion, Russia had around 135 diplomats and support staff in Prague, far more than any other diplomatic mission, including that of the US, the BBC's Rob Cameron reports from the city.Diplomatic sources had previously told the BBC that many embassy staff were undeclared intelligence officers working under diplomatic cover, and using Prague as a base for operations not just in the Czech Republic but neighbouring countries, our correspondent says.What are the claims?The explosion on 16 October 2014 tore apart an ammunition storage depot in a forest at Vrbetice in the Czech Republic.Windows in nearby buildings were blown out and local schools were evacuated as emergency vehicles rushed to the scene. The remains of two men - aged 56 and 69 - who worked at the site were found more than a month later.The blast was assumed to have been an accident.But painstaking detective work by the Czech authorities has pointed the finger at Moscow - and Unit 29155 of Russia's GRU intelligence agency.Alleged link to Salisbury attackCzech police have identified two men in connection with the blast - Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga - who are also accused of involvement in an attack using the nerve agent Novichok in the English city of Salisbury three years ago.Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent, and his daughter Yulia were poisoned, while a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, was killed months later by Novichok traces on a discarded perfume bottle.Investigative site Bellingcat identified the Salisbury suspects Ruslan Boshirov as Anatoly Chepiga, and Alexander Petrov as Alexander Mishkin, both GRU officers.Czech police matched images of the blast suspects to the two accused by Britain of the Salisbury poisoning.The clue came from passport photos sent in an email to Imex Group, the company which operated the depot.The email claimed to come from the National Guard of Tajikistan. It asked for two men to be given access to the site for an inspection visit. Scans of their passports were attached. The men were said to be Ruslan Tabarov from Tajikistan and Nicolaj Popa, a Moldovan citizen.The pictures on the passports match those of the two men accused by Britain of the Salisbury poisoning.The men booked into accommodation in Ostrava, near the ammunition depot on 13 October. They were booked to stay until 17 October.The explosion took place on the 16th and that day the pair headed to Austria to fly from Vienna airport to Moscow. The authorities do not appear to know exactly how the depot was blown up.Why might the depot have been targeted?Czech media reports, quoting unnamed investigators, suggest arms and ammunition at the depot might have been destined for either Ukrainian forces fighting pro-Russian rebels or rebels in Syria fighting the Russian-backed government there.There were actually two blasts at the depot, the first when ammunition exploded on 16 October, and the second on 3 December 150m (500ft) away, at a building containing artillery ammunition and submachine guns.One of the people storing weapons at the depot was a Bulgarian arms dealer called Emilian Gebrev, sources have told the BBC.In April 2015, six months after the Czech explosion, Mr Gebrev fell seriously ill in the Bulgarian capital Sofia.

More studies are needed to be sure.What is the Indian variant?There are many thousands of different versions, or variants, of Covid circulating.More than 100 cases of the Indian variant (also known as B.1.617) have been confirmed in the UK.Public Health England says it appears a few of the cases are not linked to international travel. Investigations into how they were acquired are continuing.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has cancelled a planned trip to India later this month and the country is being added to the government's travel ban red list.However, there is not yet enough data to say the Indian variant is of a \\\"variant of concern\\\" - a term used to describe the UK, Brazilian and South African variants.What about the UK, Brazilian and South African variants?These strains of Covid-19 may be more contagious and dodge immunity to some extent.It's not unexpected that new variants have developed. All viruses mutate as they make copies of themselves to spread and thrive.Most of these differences are inconsequential. A few can even be harmful to the virus's survival. But some can make it more infectious or threatening.Are the new variants more dangerous?There is no evidence that any of them cause much more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected.As with the original version, the risk is highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions.For the UK variant there is some research suggesting it may be associated with a 30% higher risk of death. The evidence is not conclusive, however.To prevent infection, it's important to be extra vigilant about washing your hands, keeping your distance from other people and wearing a face covering.How do the new variants mutate?The UK, South Africa, Brazil and Indian variants have all undergone changes to their spike protein - the part of the virus which attaches to human cells.One mutation, called N501Y, shared by some of them, seems to make the virus better at infecting cells and spreading.Experts think the UK\\\/Kent strain may be up to 70% more transmissible or infectious - although research by Public Health England puts it between 30% and 50%.The South Africa and Brazil variants have more potentially important changes in the spike protein.They have a key mutation, called E484K, that may help the virus evade parts of the immune system, called antibodies, that can fight coronavirus based on experience from prior infection or a vaccine.Experts recently found a small number of cases of the UK variant that have this change too.We already know the Indian variant has some potentially important mutations (E484Q, L452R and P681R).Will vaccines still work against variants?Current vaccines were designed around earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still work, although perhaps not quite as well.A recent study suggests the Brazilian variant may be resisting antibodies in people who've already had Covid and should have some immunity.However, early lab results and real life data suggest the Pfizer vaccine can protect against the new variants, although slightly less effectively.Data from the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine team suggests it protects just as well against the new UK variant.It offers less protection against the South Africa variant - but should still protect against severe illness.Early results suggest the Moderna vaccine is effective against the South Africa variant, although the immune response may not be as strong or long-lasting.Two new coronavirus vaccines awaiting approval - Novavax and Janssen - also appear to offer some variant protection.Experts say with a new virus mutation, even in a worst case scenario, vaccines could be redesigned and tweaked in weeks or months to be better matches.The UK Government has announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants, with a 50 million dose pre-order."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Coronavirus: 'Only sensible' to cancel India trip, says Johnson - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-politics-56800305","content":"Boris Johnson has said it was \\\"only sensible\\\" to cancel his trip to India, due to take place next Monday.India has been reporting more than 200,000 cases daily and has been added to the UK's \\\"red list\\\", meaning people returning from there must quarantine in a hotel for 10 days.The PM said he would instead speak to his counterpart Narendra Modi online.The trip - aimed at boosting trade and investment ties - had originally been due to take place in January.But it was called off because of the UK lockdown.The second cancellation comes as a Covid variant is spreading in India, with its government confirming 1,620 deaths from the virus on Sunday.The capital Delhi has been put into lockdown.UK health officials are investigating whether the variant, first found in India, spreads more easily and is able to resist the vaccine.Public Health England says 103 cases have been detected in England, with four more recorded in Scotland.Speaking on a visit to Bath, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: \\\"You can see around the world that the virus is still going up in a number of places.

It sounds like they were trying to do something cunning.\\\"So has he ever spoken to Olivia Newton John about what happened that night?\\\"Frida (bandmate Anni-Frid Lyngstad) is a good friend with Olivia. She says that Olivia knew that we would win,\\\" he says.\\\"We certainly talked that night, but I don't remember that, it was such chaos I hardly remember anything other than waking up the next day and finding myself and us being all over the globe suddenly.\\\"[We had] gone overnight from this obscure Swedish band to world fame... so unreal.\\\"'The plight of the songwriter'For Ulvaeus and the rest of Abba, the victory was a life-changing moment, and soon after, he says, \\\"the royalties came pouring in\\\".It afforded them space and time to establish themselves as proper professionals, able to fully focus on producing future hits including Dancing Queen, and Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight).Space and time are luxuries rarely afforded to burgeoning musical talent s in this age of streaming, he notes - especially during a pandemic.In recent months we've heard how some hit songwriters have become Uber drivers to make ends meet, and how others have been pressured into surrendering their songs.Elbow frontman Guy Garvey, who worked in Manchester bars on the long road to success, recently told a DCMS committee inquiry into the music streaming market that the way artists are paid for audio streams is \\\"threatening the future of music\\\".With all that in mind, the Abba star has just published a new report entitled Rebalancing the Song Economy. The report, conducted in collaboration with MIDiA Research, focuses on the devastating impact of Covid-19 on the global music industry, and aims to offer potential solutions to the current issues around streaming models.One suggestion is the introduction of a more fan-centric model, which would see a larger percentage of each listener's subscription fee go directly to their favourite artists and the ones they listen to the most.'The year of the song'Ulvaeus says 2020 was so awful for singers, with most music events cancelled, that they've now realised what songwriters have known for many years - and that could be the impetus for real change at last.\\\"It's been really, really difficult,\\\" he continues. \\\"Ever since the pandemic started last year, the artists stopped touring, and there were no performance royalties coming in from the touring.\\\"But funnily enough, the fact that the artists got stopped from touring made them realise how little they were actually making from streaming. They had made 70% perhaps from touring and merchandise and all of that stuff, and suddenly they had to survive on streaming.\\\"And I thought, 'Welcome to the world of songwriters' - because that is how [it is for] songwriters usually... they are always in that situation. And I think the pandemic has been very, very bad in many, many ways, but it's been good in putting the spotlight on the plight of the songwriter I think.\\\"There is a movement building up on both sides of the Atlantic - the UK, continental Europe and America, Canada - that I hope is unstoppable.\\\"It could make 2021 the year of the song, that's what I hope for.\\\"'A happy ending'The 75-year-old, who confirms that his band are set to release five long-awaited new songs of their own later this year, says he will not be selling the rights to their back catalogue anytime soon - as the likes of Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Paul Simon have done.The reason being that they have been having far too much fun with projects including the Mamma Mia films and theatre musicals, and going back to the future in an upcoming Abba avatar tour (the band haven't performed together publicly in real life since 1982, turning down some big money offers to do so).While he refuses to offer any precise details about their digital doppelgangers, the original Ulvaeus says he would not be putting his name to any official biopic either, despite the success of recent examples such as Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman.\\\"I don't think we would want that actually,\\\" he says. \\\"I certainly know myself I wouldn't want an actor - not while I'm alive - to play me on the big screen. And I don't think the others would like that either.\\\"There have been proposals, of course.

The full document runs to 55 pages. So, what is the party promising? BBC Scotland's correspondents have been analysing the pledges.1. Oppose a second independence referendumOpposition to independence is a core part of the Scottish Conservative election strategy. It features prominently in every leaflet and advert, and the manifesto is no different: the very first section is titled \\\"end division - no referendum\\\".This approach has paid off in recent years, boosting the Tories ahead of Labour at Holyrood and Westminster, and they seem as eager as ever to wrap themselves in the Union flag in a bid to sweep up \\\"No\\\" voters.At the same time though, the party does not want to look too obsessed with the constitution. They strive to say \\\"rebuild\\\" at least as often as they say \\\"referendum\\\".The manifesto lays out a range of other policies, across the spectrum of Holyrood's powers, in a bid to underline that the Tories have a vision beyond just saying no to someone else's plans.But in a way the issue of independence always lurks in the background. Because no matter what the policy proposal is, the fundamental Conservative message is that none of it will be possible if MSPs are focused on indyref2.SCOTLAND ALERTS: Get extra updates on BBC election coverage2. Help companies recover from Covid-19If the ordering of chapters is any guide, the top priority for Scottish Conservatives is opposing the SNP and independence - and then comes the economy.Targeting \\\"full employment\\\", they have policies to help companies recover from Covid, extending business rates holidays, hurrying along government grant applications, with funds for re-skilling and putting no limit to apprenticeship numbers.In replacing offshore oil and gas with renewable energy, the direction is the same as other parties, though more cautious.Affordable and social housing has an ambitious target, with a higher threshold for transactions tax among incentives for home ownership, and empty properties brought back into use.The de-centralising theme features regional development agencies across Scotland, while councils get a guaranteed formula share of central government spending.Tories want to be a tax-cutting party - but not yet. The priority is to spend more, including use of devolved welfare powers, spending above and beyond Whitehall levels.Douglas Ross intends, eventually, to return higher tax rates and thresholds to alignment with Westminster. That would mean a tax giveaway this year of £460m, and leave a smaller Holyrood budget than the Scottish government would have had without devolved income tax. So it is not factored into the balanced budget set out with the manifesto, instead being a \\\"nice to have\\\" if the sums allow it.Council tax goes untouched, but business rates would see a fundamental review, similar to one being carried out in Whitehall.3. More police on the streetsA traditional Conservative \\\"tough on crime\\\" message runs through this manifesto.The party wants to introduce whole life sentences, meaning an offender could stay in prison until they die.They are calling for greater use of short-term sentences and electronic tags, and for prisoners to lose any voting rights. They want automatic early release from prison scrapped, and more police on the streets.A Victims Law would end the \\\"not proven\\\" verdict, meaning juries are limited to the \\\"clear outcome\\\" of guilty or not guilty.This law would enable victims to challenge any decision to not prosecute, and would keep killers in prison if they refuse to reveal a body's location.The Conservatives also want to tackle causes of crime. They highlight education, mental health support and drug and alcohol services as areas where progress can be made.A Protection of Free Speech Bill would replace the recent Hate Crime Bill, legislation the Conservatives warn is \\\"over-reaching \\\".SCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICSWhat's happening? On 6 May, people across Scotland will vote to elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the government. Find out more here.What powers do they have? MSPs pass laws on aspects of life in Scotland such as health, education and transport - and have some powers over tax and welfare benefits.Who can vote? Anyone who lives in Scotland, is registered to vote and aged 16 or over on 6 May is eligible. You can register to vote online.4. EducationThe idea of \\\"Covid catch up\\\" for schools is a divisive one.Most political parties favour an approach where teachers use current class time to offer support to individuals.The Scottish Conservatives don't agree, saying a system-wide programme is needed.The party would give £120m, specifically for catch up, directly to schools over the next two years and also give them guidance on the best ways to spend it to help each year group get up to speed.It would also set up a national tutoring programme offering one-to-one or small group support to pupils who have fallen the furthest behind.The Scottish Conservatives say it would be up to local authorities and headteachers whether this work happened within the school day or in extra hours, for example at evenings and weekends.5. Address NHS workforce shortagesTackling the backlog left by the pandemic and supporting staff to recover are two of the key priorities for the Scottish Conservatives.Over the course of this year they pledge to spend £600m catching up on work that has had to be postponed. They want routine surgery and outpatient appointments to be available seven days a week with clinicians deciding who should be prioritised.The Tories also commit to investing £40m in staff wellbeing to provide mental health support and rest facilities.They say they will take a comprehensive approach to resolve workforce shortages. In the short term that means working with Westminster to address pension taxation issues and finding ways to encourage those close to retirement to stay on.Acknowledging the scale of staff shortages will be welcomed. Doctors have been warning all parties not to raise unrealistic expectations of the health service.Getting the NHS back on track remains a significant challenge and it will take time to increase capacity and find the workforce required.6. Build on the UK's increased Universal Credit payment\\\"Compassionate Conservatism\\\" has to be more than a catchphrase - and the party is trying to show it can deliver in managing the £3.6bn devolved welfare pot.They want a specific \\\"Scottish approach\\\" to social security, underpinned by what they call the \\\"broad shoulders\\\" of the UK welfare state.The manifesto highlights the UK government's increased Universal Credit payment of £20 per week and they will build on this by targeting specific groups in Scotland for help.They say the £20 uplift is for support during the pandemic - not making clear it's to last, controversially, until September.The manifesto also sets out a plan to eradicate rough sleeping by 2026, help for people with disabilities to get back into work and a top-up benefit for veterans.Finally, they support the continuation of the Scottish government's £10m international development fund.But their critics will be quick to point out the UK government is making significant cuts to the international aid budget - perhaps leaving them to question just what exactly is \\\"compassionate conservatism\\\"?7. Widen major road arteriesThe Conservatives say Scotland needs better transport links to rebuild after Covid. So they promise major investment in road, rail, and ports.On the roads, they've pledged to widen the A1, M8 and other key arteries and to improve links across the border with England.It's said all politics is local - so they promise to tackle a key local bugbear - potholes - with a £200m Road Maintenance Fund.To boost the move to electric cars, the Tories plan to subsidise charging ports in public places, homes and workplaces.They promise a Scottish Smart Travel Card, to let passengers use all types of transport with one contactless card.The Tories say freeports - with their tax-free ring-fence - can boost exports and local employment, so they'll encourage bids from ports across Scotland, including one in the north east.They want to improve ferry services with long-term contracts - and they'll take a look at \\\"alternative ways\\\" to connect island communities. Could this mean bridges to the isles - or even tunnels?8. A national charging infrastructure for electric vehicles by 2025This is not a manifesto which places a high emphasis on the environment or climate change; it's not mentioned in the introduction or the five point plan for rebuilding Scotland.In the detail is a commitment for an ambitious new electric vehicle action plan which it says must deliver a complete national charging infrastructure by 2025.It also says there should be subsidies to make both new and used EVs more affordable; although such a subsidy was cut back by the UK government only last month.Unsurprisingly there's a stated urgency to create a new support system for farmers with a pledge to reverse Scottish government cuts to the agri-environment climate scheme. But it says new agricultural policy must allow farmers to farm while supporting efforts to become sustainable.Scotland's sea will benefit too with a £25m cleaner seas fund that will remove plastics from the waters. And not just an expansion of marine protected areas but the introduction of \\\"highly\\\" protected areas.Do you have a question about the Scottish Parliament election?

- BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-scotland-53511877","content":"There have been 223,914 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 7,642 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to the Scottish government.This page analyses the key figures for the coronavirus outbreak in Scotland.Figures updated at 14:00 on 19 April.Confirmed cases of Covid-19There have been 1,593 cases detected over the past seven days, with 232 confirmed on Monday.The following chart shows the number of daily confirmed cases after an NHS Scotland or UK government test since 1 August, along with a seven-day average.The actual number of people infected during the course of the outbreak will be far higher than the overall confirmed cases figure, as many people who have Covid-19 are not tested.Scotland's second wave has seen a much bigger surge in the number of cases because many more people are being tested.The vaccination programmeThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December.Currently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.Older age groups are being prioritised in Scotland's vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.This next chart shows the progress made so far across all age groups, according to official figures.Some younger people have already had the vaccine because they have been prioritised as health or social care workers, or because they have a condition which makes them particularly vulnerable to Covid-19.The Scottish government's aim is to offer a first dose of the vaccine to everyone in Scotland aged 16 or over by the end of July.Deaths from Covid-19The first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.The spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.The rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.The chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths, so the most recent figures are subject to revision.There are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.The Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.The NRS also publishes monthly data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.Excess deaths from most causes rose significantly last year - the exception was deaths from respiratory diseases, where the number was much lower than average.How many cases are there in my area?The number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.Recent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart uses figures from a few days ago.The rate is calculated by adding up all the cases over the previous seven days and then dividing by the population of the local authority. This number is then multiplied by 100,000.The Scottish government also publishes figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.How many people are in hospital?The coronavirus outbreak has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals during both the first and second waves of the pandemic.At the peak of the outbreak in the spring there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, including over 200 in intensive care wards.Numbers reduced over the summer, but started to rise steadily again in September. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital passed the spring peak of 1,520.Only patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.They are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.However, the Scottish government now publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.How is the share of positive tests changing?The World Health Organisation (WHO) highlights the percentage of positive test results as a key measure when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.The organisation says that a positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that rates of community transmission of Covid-19 are at low levels.Other measures include declines in cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions.The Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.This is different to the WHO's preferred way of measuring the positivity rate, which is through \\\"sentinel surveillance\\\", or random community testing.However, the organisation lists \\\"overall test positivity\\\" as an additional measure if a comprehensive testing system is in place.What is the estimated R number in Scotland?The R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.If the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.The Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.Figures for all charts from Scottish government data."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Bank of England to consider digital money plan - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56799726","content":"The Bank of England and the Treasury have announced they are setting up a taskforce to explore the possibility of a central bank digital currency.The aim is to look at the risks and opportunities involved in creating a new kind of digital money.Issued by the Bank for use by households and businesses, it would exist alongside cash and bank deposits, rather than replacing them.No decision has been taken on whether to have such a currency in the UK.However, the government and the Bank want to \\\"engage widely with stakeholders\\\" on the benefits and practicalities of doing so.The taskforce will be jointly led by the Bank's deputy governor for financial stability, Sir Jon Cunliffe, and the Treasury's director general of financial services, Katharine Braddick.The Bank has previously said it is interested in a central bank digital currency (CBDC) because \\\"this is a period of significant change in money and payments\\\".The use of cash in financial transactions has been steadily declining in recent years, while debit card payments have been on the rise. Use of credit cards and direct debits have also been increasing.The Bank also sees having its own digital currency as a way of \\\"avoiding the risks of new forms of private money creation\\\", including crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin.\\\"If a CBDC were to be introduced, it would be denominated in pounds sterling, just like banknotes, so £10 of CBDC would always be worth the same as a £10 note,\\\" the Bank said.\\\"CBDC is sometimes thought of as equivalent to a digital banknote, although in some respects it may have as much in common with a bank deposit.\\\"Any CBDC would be introduced alongside - rather than replacing - cash and bank deposits.\\\"Enter Britcoin. The Bank of England has been pontificating about digital currencies for some time. Now it and the Treasury will seriously look into establishing an alternative digital currency to be used by households and businesses. The flotation of Coinbase and the stellar performance this year of various crypto-assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum is the backdrop.It would basically be a digital version of sterling, backed by the Bank of England, that could change the payments system, the plumbing of the financial system. It would not be a Bitcoin-style speculative asset with wild fluctuations in value. But there will be limited appeal for the fans of crypto, who invest precisely because of their scepticism about central banks.Instead, the revolutionary thing here could be the direct relationship that ordinary citizens might have with the central bank, which cannot go bust. It could yield simple, direct means of stimulating the economy and even applying negative rates. Central banks would in theory know when and where every e-cash transaction occurred. China is already ahead in its digital yuan experiments. Part of the rationale is to ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of financial innovation.Most of the world's central banks are looking into the possibility of creating such a currency, but the only one already in existence is China's digital yuan, which is currently undergoing public testing.Among the objectives of the UK taskforce is monitoring international developments, \\\"to ensure the UK remains at the forefront of global innovation\\\".The Bank also announced the creation of a CDBC engagement forum and a technology forum, as well as a CBDC unit within the Bank itself, overseen by Sir Jon.No timetable was announced for the taskforce's operations."},{"author":"By Kevin Peachey","title":"Is this the digital future for Bank of England banknotes? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-51851523","content":"The Bank of England is considering the introduction of electronic banknotes for use by consumers and businesses.Governor Mark Carney said: \\\"We are in the middle of a revolution in payments,\\\" saying the Bank must look into how electronic money could work.He said this would complement, not replace, paper banknotes while people still wanted physical cash.But it could open the door to programmable money to integrate with home appliances or the tax system.Banknotes have been the only way for households to make payments with central bank money for 300 years, a discussion paper published by the Bank says.The total value of banknotes in the UK economy was close to an all-time high, but people had been making fewer payments in cash, the Bank said.The governor said fintech firms had begun to offer new forms of money and new ways to pay with it, but it was important to have currency from a trusted central bank.So, the Bank is considering a Central Bank Digital Currency, which would be denominated in pounds sterling, just like banknotes. So £10 of the digital currency would always be worth the same as a £10 note.This system would be different from money held digitally in a bank account, or cryptocurrencies. It would be guaranteed by the Bank, rather than a commercial business.The idea also suggests that consumers would be able to pay for things without all the data about their transactions going to their bank. There would be some anonymity, as there is with cash.Loading Central Bank Digital Currency would be an electronic version of withdrawing banknotes from an ATM. The Bank stressed this would not replace cash, particularly for those who prefer to use it.\\\"As long as demand for cash remains, the Bank is committed to meeting this demand,\\\" the Bank's discussion paper says.The currency would also be separate from card payments, meaning it would not be affected by technical failures at Visa, Mastercard, or other payment networks.Payments of the futureThe introduction of a digital currency could lead to \\\"programmable money\\\", when payments could be integrated with appliances at home or tills at the shops.Tax payments could be routed to HM Revenue and Customs at the point of sale, the Bank said.Other examples are shares automatically paying dividends directly to shareholders, or electricity meters paying suppliers directly, based on the amount of power used.It could also help with very small payments at a lower cost than now, allowing payments such as for a few pence each time to read individual news articles, rather than signing up to a monthly subscription.Other central banks around the world are investigating the option of issuing digital currency.

Some had misgivings about what they saw as the jewel in the crown of 21st Century British technology falling into foreign hands, but guarantees that research and development would be strengthened in Cambridge seemed to allay ministers' concerns.Then when SoftBank sold Arm on to the American chip giant Nvidia last year, there were even louder complaints from the likes of Hermann Hauser who had been instrumental in the founding of the company more than 30 years ago. But it seemed there was even less likelihood of an intervention - what business of the Competition and Markets Authority was a deal between a Japanese and an American company?But much has changed since 2016. Arm being bought by Nvidia is, it appears, a national security concern now in a way that the Softbank deal was not. Why? Well the vital importance of the semiconductor industry has become clear in recent months, with chips at the centre of a US-China trade war and chip shortages halting production at car plants.There has also been a major shift in the UK's attitude towards industrial policy. After three decades of a laissez-faire approach from both Conservative and Labour governments there's a new willingness to intervene - witness the move to spend taxpayers' money on a controlling stake in the failing satellite business OneWeb.With other governments and regulators around the world not convinced that Nvidia owning Arm will be good for competition in the chip industry, it is far from certain that this deal will go through."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"HSBC boss Noel Quinn scraps executive floor at London HQ - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56799720","content":"Banking giant HSBC has confirmed that top managers in its Canary Wharf HQ have lost their offices and will have to hot-desk on an open-plan floor.It comes as HSBC pursues plans to shrink its office space by 40% in a post-pandemic shake-up.Boss Noel Quinn said the whole bank was embracing \\\"hybrid working\\\" and he would no longer come in five days a week.\\\"My leadership team and I have moved to a fully open-plan floor with no designated desks,\\\" he said on Linkedin.Up to now, senior managers have been based on the 42nd floor of the building in east London in their own private offices.But in future, they will be jostling for workspaces two floors down, while their old offices have been transformed into client meeting rooms and other communal spaces.Mr Quinn told the FT that the old arrangement had been \\\"a waste of real estate\\\", adding: \\\"Our offices were empty half the time because we were travelling around the world.\\\"In a separate post on LinkedIn he said that after more than a year working from home, being based in an open plan office would allow him to \\\"reconnect with colleagues and friends [and] be able to speak to them informally\\\".'Hybrid working'He added that most staff at the bank would be able to work part-time from home in future.\\\"A minority of roles can be done wholly remotely.

Be it returning family, friends or holiday-makers, New Zealand says welcome and enjoy yourself,\\\" Ms Ardern said.The country relies on Australia for 40% of its international tourism, injecting about NZ$2.7bn (£1.4bn, $1.9bn) into the economy.In the other direction, New Zealanders accounted for 1.3 million arrivals to Australia in 2019, contributing A$2.6bn (£1.46bn; $2bn) to the Australian economy.Qantas, Jetstar and Air New Zealand will all fly routes between the two countries.Still, the leaders warned the trans-Tasman travel bubble will be under \\\"constant review\\\" given the risks of quarantine-free travel.The two countries have also previously raised the idea of separate travel bubbles with low-risk places like Singapore, Taiwan and several Pacific island nations.Both nations have won praise for their handling of the Covid pandemic. Strict border controls and snap lockdowns are among the measures that have kept infection rates low. Australia has recorded 910 deaths, and New Zealand 26 deaths.Despite its success in containing outbreaks, the Australian government is facing growing criticism over delays in its Covid vaccination rollout.

Its business has boomed as people look for alternative ways to exercise during lockdowns and gym closures.The CPSC issued the \\\"urgent warning\\\" on Saturday, releasing video footage of a child being dragged under one of the machines.It said the machine posed \\\"serious risks to children for abrasions, fractures, and death\\\".The CPSC said it believed at least one of the 39 incidents occurred while a parent was running on the treadmill. It also warned that children could be seriously injured while the Tread+ is being used by an adult and not just during cases where children have been left unsupervised.The regulator advised owners of the machine to use it only in a locked room and to keep objects such as exercise balls away from it.Peloton said in a press release that the machine was \\\"safe for members to use in their homes and comes with safety instructions and warnings to ensure its safe use\\\".\\\"Like all motorised exercise equipment, the Tread+ can pose hazards if the warnings and safety instructions are not followed,\\\" it added.The company told owners of the machine not to let children under the age of 16 use the treadmill and to keep children, pets, and objects away from the Tread+ at all times."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Job centre workers 'feel unsafe returning to work' - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56795862","content":"Many job centre workers currently do not feel safe about returning to the office due to continued concerns about the coronavirus, a union has claimed.The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union surveyed 1,299 members and found that three in five workers feel unsafe about going back.It says \\\"a majority\\\" of in-person interviews to discuss benefits claims should be done remotely over the phone.The issue could result in industrial action, the union has warned.PCS found that only 21% of staff surveyed could say for certain that they \\\"felt safe\\\" dealing with face-to-face claimant appointments in job centres across the UK.The union says the vast bulk of the in-person interviews for Universal Credit and other benefits should be done remotely.From 12 April onwards, the numbers of in-person interviews at job centres, particularly in the 18-24 age group, will be increasing.The BBC understands there are concerns that the government wants more people to visit job centres in person so they can be assessed for \\\"conditionality\\\".The implication is that some people could see their benefits taken away from them, if they fail to meet certain behavioural conditions.Potential industrial action\\\"These results reflect the anger and frustration our members feel every day,\\\" said PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka.\\\"Thousands of Department for Work & Pensions (DWP) staff have been providing support to claimants safely from home throughout the pandemic - the only logical reason they would insist on fully reopening is because management's obsession with sanctioning vulnerable claimants.\\\"He added that the statistics collected by the union \\\"should send a strong signal to ministers\\\" that they needed to meet with staff soon \\\"to avoid potential industrial action\\\".A DWP spokesman said: \\\"Throughout this pandemic, jobcentres have remained open to ensure we can continue to provide vital support to the most vulnerable.

Anyone who has lost a job, or whose income has been sporadic owing to the pandemic's effect on employment may find it difficult to secure a mortgage.House prices have been rising - partly because of government stimulus, and there are concerns too about the potential for some to fall into negative equity if this is followed by sharp falls in property values.Some of the new mortgage rates are close to 4% for a two-year fixed rate deal. For example, rates on NatWest's new 95% mortgages will start at 3.9%.Lloyd Cochran, head of mortgages at NatWest, told the BBC's Today programme: \\\"It reflects the extra risk the bank is taking on. I think over the long term that is a pretty competitive rate for customers.\\\"One of the things we do is ensure that the customer can afford that rate. We also ensure... the customer can afford that loan if interest rates were to rise.\\\"However,analysts say rates could be cut significantly, by as much as 0.75 of a percentage point, for borrowers able to stretch to a 10% deposit.\\\"With more lenders poised to launch deals for this sector of the market, [borrowers] level of choice should hopefully increase even further,\\\" said Eleanor Williams, from financial information service Moneyfacts.\\\"Increased competition within the higher loan-to-value tiers will hopefully translate to more competitive rates for these borrowers.\\\""},{"author":"By Nina Nanji","title":"Facebook: Our staff can carry on working from home after Covid - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56759151","content":"Facebook says its employees can continue working from home, even as other tech giants appear to be going off the idea.The social media company told the BBC it thinks remote work is \\\"the future\\\".People in eligible roles at Facebook can apply for permanent remote working, subject to approval from managers.Silicon Valley executives were quick to endorse the shift to remote work last year, with some indicating it could continue even after the pandemic.Last May, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg predicted 50% of the company's employees could be working remotely within the next five to ten years.Twitter's Jack Dorsey made headlines at the same time, when he announced his employees \\\"can now work from home forever\\\".But as the months have passed, some of the drawbacks have emerged.At a conference in October, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said the lack of division between private life and work life meant \\\"it sometimes feels like you are sleeping at work\\\".Last month, Google announced it was bringing forward its timetable of moving people back into the office.People 'thrived' at homeThe coronavirus crisis prompted a rapid shift away from office working to home working.Now, as firms look beyond the pandemic, many are deciding whether to bring employees back to offices or allow them to stay at home.Brynn Harrington, who is Facebook's vice president of People Growth, says some workers have been \\\"really thriving\\\" at home and will be keen to continue doing so.\\\"For example, parents who are closer to their children and are happy to cut their commute time and optimise their work day, they're thrilled to work from home,\\\" she said.But she admits it has not been easy for everyone.\\\"Obviously this is working from home during a pandemic, we are not in a period of healthy remote work,\\\" she said.\\\"We have people juggling care giving responsibilities, we have people living in small apartments with roommates, those people desperately want to get back into offices, and we're working really hard to do that, as soon as it's safe to open our offices.\\\"Facebook plans to start reopening its Silicon Valley offices at the beginning of May, after more than a year of working from home during the pandemic.Its largest offices won't reach 50% capacity until September at the earliest.Pay ratesThe social media giant insists the shift to remote work is not about saving costs.

The brand placed importance on creating a menu of \\\"healthy fast-food\\\", Mr Vincent told the BBC in a 2019 interview.Mr Vincent said on Sunday that he has \\\"had the pleasure of getting to know Mohsin and Zuber [Issa] across the last few years.\\\"They have been enthusiastic customers of Leon, going out of their way to eat here whenever they visit London. They are decent, hard-working business people who are committed to sustaining and further strengthening the values and culture that we have built\\\".The Asda deal has understandably attracted the most attention, but this is the latest example of EG Group's wider strategy in growing its non-fuel and food service operations.The Issa brothers' statement today certainly gave no indication they're finished yet.It was already apparent they were also interested in adding to their menu of café and restaurant brands. They have shown a taste for Caffè Nero, although the coffee chain rejected their bid in November - shortly after launching a company voluntary agreement (CVA).John Vincent has been open about how tough the past year's lockdowns have been for the brand he started 17 years ago, and Leon's outlets are most concentrated in London.Locations such as Canary Wharf, London Bridge railway station and Heathrow Airport seem unlikely to experience a return to pre-pandemic levels of trade soon.Under EG Group's plans, it's now set to expand into both new geographical and - with possible drive-throughs - operational areas.The Issa brothers, two entrepreneurs from Blackburn, in February completed a deal to buy Asda, Britain's third-largest supermarket chain, from US owners Walmart.It was valued at £6.8bn, but the brothers and the investment firm TDR Capital paid just £780m.The deal is still awaiting approval from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, which is expected by the summer.As part of it, Asda's 323 petrol stations will be sold for £750m to EG Group, adding to the portfolio of more than 6,000 around the world.In 2020, questions were raised about the group's finances after its auditor, Deloitte, suddenly quit in October and was replaced by KPMG.EG Group said the auditor had signed a \\\"clean audit\\\" for EG Group's 2019 financial accounts and there had been \\\"no disagreements on any auditing or accounting matters\\\"."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Archegos collapse costs Morgan Stanley $911m - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56775991","content":"US investment bank Morgan Stanley has admitted that the collapse of hedge fund Archegos cost it nearly $1bn.The Wall Street bank said in its first-quarter results that the $911m (£660m) charge was related to losses at \\\"a single prime brokerage client\\\" that it later identified as Archegos.Despite the Archegos hit, Morgan Stanley's profits for the period were up 150% thanks to a deal-making boom.Net profit came in at $3.98bn, up from $1.59bn a year ago.Net revenue soared to $15.67bn as the bank took in more fees from a slew of business mergers, acquisitions and companies listing on the stock market.The Archegos write-off muddied what was also a record first quarter for the investment bank.What happened at Archegos?Hedge funds make money buying and selling shares. It is thought that Archegos made some large investments in certain companies that started to go wrong.Its backers then insisted it raise money in a hurry, in what is known as a margin call, prompting some unusually large share sales.A margin call is when a bank asks a client to put up more funds if a trade partly funded with borrowed money has dropped steeply.If they can't afford to do that, the lender will sell the shares to try to recover what it is owed to the bank.By the end of March, Archegos owed Morgan Stanley $644m, while the investment bank lost another $267m by selling out of shares linked to its trades with the hedge fund.Chief executive James Gorman said the decision to write off its trading with its client Archegos was \\\"necessary and money well spent\\\".Morgan Stanley was one of six big banks that had exposure to Archegos when it was forced last month to sell stocks quickly at a loss in an effort to recover funds.Switzerland's Credit Suisse previously warned it would have to withstand a loss of more than $4.2bn due to its trading with the now-collapsed hedge fund."},{"author":"By James Clayton","title":"Amazon: How one cancer patient's story helps explain the Alabama union vote - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-56742772","content":"Carla Johnson turned 45 on Tuesday, a milestone she thought she might not reach.On 12 July, she walked up to a manager at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, and said she felt unwell.Shortly afterwards, she had a seizure on the floor. She was rushed to hospital and diagnosed with brain cancer.She's exactly the type of person you might expect to have supported a recent vote to create the first trade union of Amazon workers, in order to safeguard her job post-surgery.But despite having been in a union in her previous career, she was one of a majority of employees - two-to-one, in fact - to vote the proposal down.\\\"Amazon has been a godsend for me,\\\" she says.Carla was a teacher for 14 years in Birmingham, Alabama. She taught 12 and 13-year-old children science.In 2019 she decided to work for a contractor - preparing students for exams. Then the pandemic hit. With pupils no longer in school, the work dried up.She looked around for other jobs and found a company that was actually hiring - Amazon. Her first shift was in May.\\\"I first started out packing. Depending on the item, I would pack it in the box, give it an address and put it on a conveyor belt to be shipped out to the customers. It wasn't anything that was hard.\\\"Then one Sunday in July her world fell apart. After her seizure, she remembers telling the paramedics to ring her mum, but little else.She had surgery to remove a brain tumour, and chemotherapy. Her treatment has cost around $170,000 (£123,000) so far. She says she would never have been able to pay without insurance.To understand labour relations in the US is impossible without looking at healthcare.A job isn't just a pay cheque, it's a ticket to a longer, healthier life - for workers and their families.Crucial then to Amazon's strategy to win a union vote was its healthcare plan for workers. \\\"Starting pay of at least $15 per hour and comprehensive healthcare from day one\\\" was the oft-said message.Amazon's tactics had a darker side though. The union wanted to talk about excessive workload, bathroom breaks and pay. Amazon pushed the narrative that the union might take away worker benefits, including healthcare.Workers were bombarded with messages, including texts, which claimed workers' benefits might be bargained away by the union.\\\"You may end up with more, the same, or less\\\" is the message from a union info-website set up by Amazon.In practice, it would be highly unusual for a union to negotiate away existing perks - and of course it would be Amazon taking away the benefits.\\\"The only way that happens is if the employer decides to take them away. The union's not going to argue: 'Let's cut benefits for the workers'\\\" says Stuart Appelbaum, head of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union that is pushing for Amazon workers to unionise.Mr Appelbaum is angry. He believes Amazon played dirty - that the messaging given to Amazon workers at \\\"union education meetings\\\" for example, known by the union as \\\"captive audience meetings\\\", was misinformation dressed up as fact.The Amazon centre itself was cloaked in anti-union messaging - in the bathrooms, the break rooms and the entrance, for example.Darryl Richardson voted for the union. But while trying to persuade others, he realised Amazon's messaging was working: \\\"They were scared that healthcare was going to be taken away. That's why a lot of them voted \\\"no\\\" against the union. We got the outcome we have now because they threatened them, that benefits and wages were going to drop.\\\"Darryl himself had been laid off from his job in a car plant during the pandemic. He's thankful for the job he has and doesn't want to leave. But he believes Amazon's characterisation of the union was inaccurate - particularly when it came to wages and healthcare.Another area of controversy were union subs, or dues. Critics say that much of Amazon's narrative was based around the idea that workers would have to pay the union money. However, Alabama is a Right To Work state. No worker has to pay subs. So did Amazon break the law in their messaging?\\\"It's not clear\\\" says Prof John Logan, a labour expert at San Francisco State University.\\\"They are very skilled in operating in the grey areas, that's why they're so effective. You know some of what they say is clearly legal. Other things are kind of pushing the boundaries of the law - and the weakness of the law.\\\"Amazon says: \\\"It was important that all employees understood the facts of joining a union... If the union vote passed, it would impact everyone at the site and it's important all associates understood what that meant for them\\\".But whether the messaging was on the right side of the law or not, one thing was overlooked by many observers who thought the union could win.The pandemic has caused unemployment which has disproportionately affected black communities.Around 85% of the workers at Amazon's warehouse in Bessemer are black.And that means this was a workforce acutely sensitive to arguments around pay, benefits and the future of their jobs.The union argues that Amazon's tactics amount to \\\"intimidation\\\" of workers and are mounting a legal challenge. Amazon denies the allegations.\\\"Our employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us\\\", said a spokesperson.Carla started working again at Amazon in November. \\\"I felt the things the union were offering, I was already getting,\\\" she says.She spent her birthday having a spa day, and then watched her youngest son play baseball. She is now in remission, and firmly believes she wouldn't be alive if she hadn't been working for an employer with good healthcare. She may well be right.And as for unions? Well, union membership has been falling since the 1980s. Only 6% of Americans working in the private sector are members of a union.And unless unions can find a way of convincing people like Carla that they can make a positive impact on healthcare, benefits and wages, that's not going to change.James Clayton is the BBC's North America technology reporter based in San Francisco.

We realised that by joining together we could make a difference.\\\"With other members including a cider-producer, butcher, coffee-roaster and two breweries, they now have a website where people can order from all the firms. Customers then collect everything in one go from a weekly drive-through market.As mentioned, Wye Valley was set up as a cooperative. But what exactly is that? Put simply, it is a business that is owned by its members and democratically run.It could be, as in the case of Wye Valley, a group of small firms that come together. Or it may be a collective of self-employed workers who run a single business, or even a larger retailer - such as the Co-Op supermarket chain - whose members include millions of its customers who have signed up.The common factor is that there aren't any external shareholders, and profits are either reinvested, or shared among the members.It all sounds a bit old-fashioned, and the co-operative movement was indeed founded in the 19th Century. But there are today more than 7,000 co-operatives in the UK, and a whopping three million around the world.Many, both within the UK and elsewhere, say that being a co-operative has made them more resilient to the pandemic than if they had been stand-alone, standard businesses.At Wye Valley Producers, Ms Underwood says members spend many hours on Zoom calls, helping each other: \\\"It isn't just about the money, but sharing skills and knowledge, with people in the same boat.\\\"The International Co-operative Alliance (ICA), the global organisation that represents the movement, says that this increased coming together in response to Covid-19 has been replicated around the world.\\\"Online meetings and webinars were organised by cooperatives across the world,\\\" says ICA director of legislation Santosh Kumar. \\\"The international exchange of practices and resources has been widespread.\\\"In Southampton, cooperative shop October Books has been trading since 1977. In addition to books it sells vegan food, vegetables and ethical cleaning products.\\\"At the start of the pandemic there were feelings of anxiety and uncertainty, of not being sure what to do,\\\" says staff member Clare Diaper.October Books says that thanks to support and advice from Cooperatives UK, the organisation that represents the movement in the UK, it had the knowledge and confidence to adapt to the new situation.\\\"Being a cooperative meant we could have difficult conversations about what was best for the shop as a team,\\\" says Ms Diaper.October Books and its 103 members decided to keep the shop open, but temporarily furlough four of the eight permanent staff. \\\"The decisions to furlough workers and reduce opening hours were made collectively,\\\" adds Ms Diaper.Across Europe in Croatia, women-led cooperative Brlog Brewery has been making a range of beers since 2016.\\\"When the pandemic hit, first we were in shock because we had made a lot of beer,\\\" says co-founder Ana Teskera.\\\"Suddenly, it was all stuck at the warehouse. There was potential that we would [lose it] and wouldn't get paid for the goods already sold.\\\"The brewery's six directors, and 90 cooperative members, who include volunteers and customers, came up with a plan - they would shift from selling to bars and shops.\\\"[Instead] we sold most of the beer through the coop network, distributing direct to members, and even had to produce more,\\\" says Ms Teskera.It was so successful that last summer the brewery, based in the coastal city of Zadar, moved to a bigger facility.\\\"We learned a lot, made great changes, kept all our employees - even added a new one,\\\" says Ms Teskera. \\\"The team is more connected now, strong and happy to go forward.\\\"New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.In India, an organisation called the Self-Employed Women's Association (Sewa) has helped female workers form cooperatives since 1972.Now with more than 1.8 million members, Sewa offers them advice and support on everything from business finance to expansion and marketing.\\\"The pandemic has been a double whammy for our members,\\\" says Sewa senior coordinator Salonie Muralidhara Hiriyur. \\\"It has disrupted health and livelihoods on a massive scale. Some sectors of work, like domestic work and childcare, came to a complete halt.\\\"To help its members find new income opportunities during the pandemic, Sewa ran training classes via WhatsApp video calls, including one on how to manufacture face masks.Rehat Rangrez, a member of a handicrafts cooperative called Abodana Mandali, took part. \\\"I then started training other women in the cooperative on how to make masks too - all on video calls,\\\" she says.She and her \\\"fellow cooperative sisters\\\" went on to make 20,000 masks in just three months. Because of this work, Ms Rangrez had enough income to support her family.Gabriel Burdin, associate professor in economics at Leeds University, says that cooperatives generally cut jobs a lot less.\\\"In conventional business, layoffs are the most frequent cost-cutting strategy,\\\" he says. \\\"Cooperatives adjust along other margins, such as pay cuts or work-sharing arrangements. Cooperatives share the consequences of a crisis among their members.\\\"However, Prof Burdin also cautions that cooperatives do come with their own risks, especially those where the members and owners are the workers.He says that such people are in the position where they invest their own money in the business that they also work for, and are paid by. So if the business fails, they lose both their wages and any money they have invested.\\\"By providing labour and capital to the same company, they are putting all their eggs in one basket,\\\" says Prof Burdin.Looking ahead, Cooperatives UK is now continuing to gather evidence for its 2021 Coop Economy Report into the sector. It says early indications show new cooperatives are still being formed and fewer have closed than in previous years.\\\"[And] we know that before the pandemic, new start coops were nearly twice as likely to survive their first five years than other types of businesses,\\\" says Cooperatives UK chief executive Rose Marley.Back in south east Wales, Ms Underwood says that Wye Valley Producers - which has members from both sides of the border - is now considering a delivery service: \\\"And we can't wait to do events and courses, we have some great ideas up our sleeve.\\\""},{"author":"By Karishma Vaswani","title":"Is Alibaba's fate a warning to China\u2019s tech giants? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56741551","content":"It's been a tough week for Chinese tech firms.Over the weekend, Chinese billionaire Jack Ma's e-commerce giant Alibaba was fined $2.8bn (£2bn) by Chinese regulators, who said it had abused its market position for years.Then on Monday, Chinese digital payments firm Ant Group - an affiliate of Alibaba - announced a drastic restructuring plan with regulators forcing it to act more like a bank than a tech firm.And on Tuesday, 34 companies, the who's who of China's tech world, were summoned by officials and warned: let Alibaba be a lesson to you.They've been given one month to \\\"self-reflect\\\" and comply with China's new rules for platform companies.Alibaba is the grandfather of China's tech industry. It dominates the marketplace there with over 800 million users in China alone.That is why it was a wake-up call for others in the tech sector when the firm was fined and officially reprimanded.The investigation into Alibaba determined that it had abused its market position for years by restricting merchants from doing business or running promotions on rival platforms. The fine amounts to about 4% of the company's 2019 domestic revenue.Industry players tell me \\\"everyone is tense\\\". The big firms are worried they're next.Companies like Tencent, JD.com, Meituan, Bytedance and Pinduoduo are all looking at Alibaba's experience, and trying to avoid crossing any red lines set by Beijing.No-one can be more powerful than the PartyOn the face of it, Alibaba's fine is about increased regulation in the sprawling Chinese tech sector, and for many it is a good sign that the market has matured.\\\"If you read the laws, Chinese regulators are trying to be more forward looking and think ahead, in an attempt to regulate an industry that is moving so fast,\\\" says Rui Ma, a China tech analyst and co-host of the podcast Tech Buzz China.\\\"They are including the use of algorithms, not just market share.

But he faces pressure from his party to do far more.Top Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have called on the president to use his power to wipe out borrower debts up to $50,000.The proposal would completely eliminate debts for more than 34 million people and could cost as much as $1tn by some estimates - as much as the country has spent on housing assistance over two decades.For Washington, the embrace of such demands marks a striking change, as an idea advanced by anti-corporate greed Occupy Wall Street activists a decade ago - and resoundingly rejected by the Trump administration - moves to the heart of political debate.\\\"It's an issue that has really reached a critical moment where it just cannot persist as it has any longer,\\\" says Persis Yu, director of the Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project at the National Consumer Law Center.\\\"The fact that widespread cancellation has gained so much momentum and is now more of a mainstream idea is an acknowledgement of that crisis.\\\"How did the US get to this point?More than 42 million people in the US - roughly one in six adults - hold student debt, which averages roughly $30,000 for a four-year undergraduate degree.Financial stress from the loans, which bring typical monthly bills of nearly $400 for recent graduates, has been blamed for holding back a generation financially.Nearly a fifth of borrowers are in default and millions more are behind on payments, which come due shortly after graduation regardless of employment or income.The government, which owns more than 90% of the debts, estimates that roughly a third will never get repaid.Previous efforts to address the issue have focused on borrowers who were misled by for-profit universities about fees and job prospects.The US has also tried to expand programmes that reduce debts for people in certain public service jobs, or tie repayment to income - moving closer to a system like that in the UK, where the average debt load is higher and the government expects more losses, but borrowers are better shielded from issues like default.But widespread problems with actually accessing the US programmes have led to demands for broader, more immediate loan forgiveness, in addition to other reforms.\\\"We need widespread debt cancellation of some amount to help clear the books,\\\" says Ms Yu, whose organisation recently obtained federal data that showed that just 32 people had actually had their debts forgiven via income-driven repayment plans.\\\"It's really hard to discern who deserves relief and who doesn't,\\\" she adds. \\\"If you want to start slicing and dicing who is entitled to relief, I assure you folks who need it won't get it.\\\"'Our system is broken'Alicia says she's an example of how big the problem is. She won the $20,000 debt discharge after years of fighting over loans she took out when she enrolled in a for-profit Florida college in 2006, hoping to launch a career in law enforcement.Two years in, she says the school stopped communicating with her.\\\"It didn't seem right that I would pay all this money and have nothing to show for it,\\\" says Alicia, who joined the student loan advocacy group Debt Collective and filed claims with the government, ultimately suing to force action.But even after winning that battle, she still faces the prospect of decades of bills to repay the further $75,000 she took on to finally earn her masters degree from a public university while working as a bartender.\\\"I'm not paying for something that was a scam but I'll still have tonnes of debt,\\\" says Alicia, now a private intelligence analyst.\\\"Our system is broken,\\\" she adds. \\\"It's to the point now where it's like the housing bubble - it's going to burst. You can only milk people so much before they just give up.\\\"'Fundamentally unfair'?President Biden has backed forgiveness of up to $10,000 in debt - a proposal analysts estimate would affect about a quarter of outstanding debt, or more than $400bn, and completely eliminate burdens for more than 15 million people.But he has rejected the calls to waive up to $50,000.\\\"I will not make that happen,\\\" he said at a town hall earlier this year, arguing that such a move would benefit graduates of elite professional schools, like doctors and lawyers, and the money would be better spent, for instance, on lowering tuition costs.His resistance reflects voter concerns.In a February Harris poll of roughly 1,000 adults, just 46% of people said they supported some level of debt forgiveness, down from two months earlier. Republicans have also consistently opposed widespread debt relief.\\\"It's fundamentally unfair to ask two-thirds of Americans who don't go to college to pay the bills for the mere one third who do,\\\" Donald Trump's Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a speech last year.Advocates say they remain hopeful that Mr Biden will act, noting that the issue is especially important to young voters and ethnic minority communities, who were key to his election victory.They say they have been encouraged by steps he has taken that would clear the way for forgiveness to occur, such as asking for a formal legal opinion about his powers to do so without Congress, and that he should seize the chance for reform while student loan payments are on hold due to the pandemic.\\\"You have this once-in-a-generation opportunity to actually fix things before people have to start paying their bills again,\\\" says Mike Pierce, director of policy at the Student Borrower Protection Center.\\\"It's going to be a test of this administration's political will whether they can actually get the job done.\\\""},{"author":"By Jeremy Howell","title":"CEO Secrets: 'Taking risks is how we found our edge' - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56732929","content":"When George James started the social media agency Be-Hookd Digital eight years ago, he thought he and his then-business partner made the perfect team.\\\"I was young.

The company was founded in 2014 by two Oxford professors - Paul Newman and Ingmar Posner - whose university research focused on self-driving cars.The startup company has just raised new funding from investors in the UK, US and China. Ocado's £10m stake is part of that funding round, and will give it a seat on Oxbotica's board.In its announcement, Ocado tempered expectations and said that getting permission from regulators to operate autonomous vehicles on public roads - allowing driverless deliveries to customers' homes - may take some time.But it said that \\\"last-mile\\\" deliveries to customers' homes are a significant part of an online retailer's costs, with labour accounting for half of that - so autonomous vans could produce big savings.In the short term, it sees vehicles operating in restricted areas such as its own warehouses, with the first prototypes coming within two years.Ocado executives hate it when you call it an online grocer. The company wants to be seen as a technology platform for the world's retailers. This partnership with another British business, the scrappy autonomous software startup Oxbotica, is meant to signal the scale of its ambitions.For Oxbotica's Paul Newman, it's an exciting opportunity for two UK companies to become a global force in technology which has been dominated by American and Chinese players - \\\"we've got a global vision, we're going to change the way goods are moved,\\\" he told me this morning.And Ocado's technology boss Alex Harvey points out that the company has already acquired two American tech businesses this year.\\\"It's normally the other way around...

But he says now, the time is right: \\\"This is a sensible proposition that makes economic sense.\\\"But sceptics will wonder how motorists will feel about sharing the roads with driverless vans, let alone what customers will think about a robot telling you that the avocados are out of stock and you're getting oranges instead."},{"author":"Rory Cellan-Jones","title":"Tech Tent: Bye-bye Silicon Valley, hello global workforce? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-56771539","content":"As coronavirus lockdowns begin to ease in some parts of the world, the debate about the future of work intensifies.In Silicon Valley, some tech companies are having second thoughts about abandoning their offices and letting everyone work from home.But on this week's Tech Tent, we meet a tech entrepreneur who believes offices are over and his staff can work from anywhere.Phil Libin is a serial entrepreneur who, until recently, could not imagine working anywhere but Silicon Valley. As chief executive of the note-taking app Evernote, he was not a fan of working from home - indeed he banned video meetings at the company, believing people needed to be in the room to make a proper contribution.But now, he has moved to Arkansas and his latest venture is mmhmm, a video presentation tool designed to liven up those endless calls on Zoom or Microsoft Teams.What's more, he has told the workforce of what he describes as a \\\"distributed\\\" company that there will never be an office for them to attend.He tells Tech Tent that this kind of business has a number of superpowers, chief among them an end to commuting. He asks us to imagine what would happen if he called a meeting to change that remote-work system.\\\"We're going to try a new thing. I'm going to need each of you to spend two hours every day sitting in traffic,\\\" he says.\\\"Yes, it's not productive, you can't work and you're not spending time with your family.

Well, why not? Right? Like, why do I care where you live? I just care about how productive you are.\\\"Now so far, his company only has a policy of uniform salaries across the United States - an engineer gets paid the same whether they live in San Francisco or Kansas City - but he insists the plan is to have the same pay around the globe.It is hard to imagine shareholders of bigger companies approving a policy of effectively throwing money at workers who would accept far less, but maybe Mr Libin is ahead of his time.He accepts that many Silicon Valley businesses may have different views of the future of work. \\\"The only thing that we know is that there's going to be massive change in the world,\\\" he says.The last year has shown how rapidly our working lives can adapt to new circumstances when we have access to fast connectivity and advanced digital tools.Employers who demand that their workers go back to the old ways may find they face a revolt."},{"author":"By Tom Espiner","title":"Hundreds lose job in British Gas contracts row - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56746656","content":"Almost 500 British Gas engineers have lost their jobs after they refused to sign new contracts.The company had given staff until midday on Wednesday to agree to new terms, which will force them to work more hours and cut average pay.Centrica, which owns British Gas, said around 2% of its staff had chosen not to sign the new contracts and would therefore leave the firm.However, it declined to give precise numbers saying they could still change.Andy Prendergast, acting national secretary of GMB union said: \\\"Today has been the largest mass dismissal in living memory and this won't be forgotten.\\\"Members are upset and angry that after everything, the company has still decided to do this.\\\"'It's not about the money'Miles Hobson was a British Gas engineer for 38 years before declining to sign his new contract.

Mills called the plans \\\"a cheap imitation of an American town\\\".One unnamed official responded to the campaign by saying: \\\"Isn't it ludicrous that a few old ladies should be allowed to spend time and money questioning the decisions of experts?\\\"Raising the temperature, it emerged the council had given permission for demolition before publicly announcing the scheme.The planners won, though did make some concessions: some of the city's historical caves were preserved, but Drury Hill would be destroyed and the Broadmarsh Shopping Centre would be built.A Miss E.M. Palmer said: \\\"The council has robbed citizens of a favourite part of the city.\\\"She reported being criticised by a planner for acting out of \\\"sentiment\\\", to which she responded that he did not live in Nottingham and: \\\"How would he like a favoured part of his garden to be stolen?\\\".Shortly after being completed, the Broadmarsh was voted the ugliest building in Nottingham.Source: Nottsflix, YouTube historianAnd while shoppers got their chain stores under one roof, the Broadmarsh - along with a neighbouring multi-storey car park and four-lane through road - cut the city in two.For a while, the Broadmarsh's mix of big, high street outlets, interspaced with burger bars and the occasional local name, drew in customers.But now, changing retail habits, financial crashes, poor building quality and clumsy designs have left many cities wondering what to do with these behemoths.Until recently the favoured solution was to remodel the building - a high-profile example was Birmingham's Bullring - but keep its purpose essentially the same: a big box full of shops.But Nottingham has been presented with different challenge - the old building is all but demolished. Could it need a different solution?The city council cannot be accused of underestimating the importance of the situation.'Green spaces'A major consultation attracted more than 3,000 responses and an independent panel has been appointed to consider the site's future.David Mellen, the authority's leader, said: \\\"The Broadmarsh Centre is one of the largest regeneration areas in any UK city and presents us with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to renew our city centre and our city's character.\\\"It's no surprise to us that people value a mix of green spaces and other developments, such as retail, housing and offices which, alongside our carbon neutral ambitions, we'd want to see reflected in the site.\\\"He defended the legacy of the original Broadmarsh Centre, saying: \\\"It was convenient for a lot of people; it was bustling in the 1970s.\\\"But we want to look forward and create something suitable for the future.\\\"Suggestions have so far been varied - from keeping part of the old shopping centre building but adding a rooftop garden, through performance spaces with vertical farming, to converting the entire area into a nature reserve.'Golden opportunity'But can Nottingham do something completely different? Step away from the glass and steel blocks favoured by today's urban developers?There is one simple solution but it is radically unusual...Just put the old city back.Mr Rogan said: \\\"Let's have streets which twist and turn. The old streets were there for centuries, the new pattern is barely 40 years old.\\\"Rather than huge blocks which make windy canyons and fill them with identikit stores, lets have smaller, individual shops.\\\"I work with buildings hundreds of years old that, if you look after them, will last and last.\\\"But I see offices and shops from the last few decades whose leases are longer than their life spans, that are so poorly built they are not worth repairing.\\\"The idea is backed by the city's Civic Society, which called it a \\\"golden opportunity\\\" to deliver \\\"state-of-the-art, energy-efficient, traffic-free, mixed-use community\\\".What might seem like a (literally) monumental piece of nostalgia has some significant backers - and some examples to follow.Mr Allford says: \\\"Putting back the streets makes a certain amount of sense.\\\"These are streets which developed over hundreds of years and streets change rarely.\\\"I always look at the historical grain of a city to see what I can learn about how it works with the topography and how it has connected with the citizens over centuries.\\\"So looking again at those streets is not nostalgic; it is common sense.\\\"TV presenter and architectural historian Dan Cruikshank has helped highlight the destruction of Britain's historical town centres in the 1960s and 70s.He said: \\\"Re-establishing old street patterns is a well-established policy and is often very sound.\\\"Interesting examples of replacing older developments with something more sensitive are Paternoster Square in London and Southgate in Bath.\\\"An obvious issue is the cost of more traditional construction techniques - like those used in listed buildings - can be 30-50% higher than standard ones.But Mr Cruikshank warns today's decision-makers must learn from the - well-intentioned - mistakes by planners of the 60s and 70s.\\\"They wanted more humane, more hygienic cities with more light, away from the terraces and factories and overcrowding of the Victorian era.\\\"The problem was it was often done with a lack of respect for history and tradition.\\\"Too often it was done on the cheap, then this was compounded by not enough investment for maintenance.\\\"Mr Allford feels whatever scheme is chosen, the city council must be both considered and yet also far-thinking, as demolition and rebuilding every 30 to 50 years is not sustainable.He says: \\\"The days of 'Brave New World' where we just rebuilt cities and told people to go live in them are long over.\\\"This needs to be a plan for the long-term. This mustn't just solve the problems of today but be adaptable enough to handle the challenges yet unknown.\\\"Retail is under a lot of pressure, so high streets may become smaller. Maybe schools and homes will move back in.\\\"But Mr Cruikshank says more intangible criteria also play a part.\\\"Nottingham is a world-famous city with a great reputation for history of the most romantic sort.\\\"Any project must respect that.\\\"Individual character is what people remember, what can really define a place and give it a sense of belonging and soul.\\\"Final demolition of the Broadmarsh Centre is due to begin in mid-April and will take 12 months.The independent panel is expected to present its plans by the end of the summer.Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

HSBC has about $1.6tn (£1.2tn) in funds from its wealth business, half of which comes from Asia.The bank is not just competing with traditional rivals like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan in this space.

This allows them to maintain a service if a problem develops in one of the provider's systems, while still enjoying efficiency savings from not having to maintain and install a wider range of products.Other companies, including NEC and Samsung, are also active in the sector.

Facebook is still pursuing end-to-end encryption plans that place the good work and the progress that has already been made at jeopardy,\\\" she said.\\\"Offending is continuing, and will continue - these images of children being abused just continue to proliferate, even right now while we are speaking. But the company intends to blind itself to this problem through end-to-end encryption which prevents all access to messaging content.\\\"\\\"My view is that this is simply not acceptable,\\\" she added.Facebook, however, said that \\\"end-to-end encryption is already the leading security technology used by many services to keep people safe from hackers and criminals\\\". Safety features are already a part of its plans, it added.'Scrambled' messagesEnd-to-end encryption guarantees privacy by making sure only the sender or recipient can read the messages.While it travels, it is scrambled to be unreadable, including by law enforcement. The only way to read the message is usually to get physical access to an unlocked device receiving it.Currently, only one of Facebook's major messaging platforms - WhatsApp - uses end-to-end encryption by default. The company has plans to make the privacy feature the norm on Facebook Messenger and Instagram - but has not yet done so.When messaging platforms are not end-to-end encrypted, tech giants such as Facebook can use automatic scanning of their users' posts to identify the sharing of known child abuse images and detect questionable use of private messaging - such as an older person chatting to underage users they do not already know.The NSPCC argues that rolling out the encryption as planned would \\\"render these [scanning] tools useless\\\", and is calling on Facebook to reconsider. An estimate from the US National Center for Missing and Exploited children suggests as many as 70% of child abuse reports around the world could be lost if it goes ahead.The NPSCC unveiled research at the event that suggests social media users are keen to see some guarantee that children's safety will be protected.The charity is demanding a \\\"reset\\\" of the debate, arguing that it has become stuck as an \\\"either\\\/or\\\" debate between personal privacy and child safety.Instead, it is calling for a \\\"balanced\\\" solution that protects both.Ms Patel echoed that sentiment, saying: \\\"I want to make it clear that the government does support encryption, where of course companies can protect users' privacy, and there are many areas where this is important.\\\"\\\"We believe that it is possible to implement end-to-end encryption, the service, in a way in which is also consistent with public protection and child safety,\\\" she said.But she did not say what that would look like. Some possible solutions, such as on-device software that scans messages before they are sent, have their own privacy concerns.Encryption still 'popular'Gaining access to the content of encrypted messages has long been a topic of debate in government.One of Ms Patel's predecessors, Amber Rudd, argued in the wake of the 2017 Westminster attack that \\\"we need to make sure that our intelligence services have the ability to get into... encrypted WhatsApp\\\".And former Prime Minister David Cameron, in the wake of the 2015 Paris attacks, declared that there should be no \\\"means of communication\\\" which \\\"we cannot read\\\".Despite such concerns, encrypted messaging remains a sensitive topic with much public support.Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, said: \\\"Encryption is popular and growing because users want security and protection from fraud, scams and abuse of their data.\\\"\\\"It would be completely unreasonable to ban or limit everyday security for one set of people over the other.\\\"It is absolutely necessary to deal with child abuse images, but solutions must be compatible with people's right to keep themselves safe from other kinds of criminality, so should move away from endlessly debating how to stop the use of encryption.\\\"But Sir Peter Wanless, NSPCC chief executive, argued that view risked \\\"leaving children unprotected where there is most harm\\\".\\\"It's in firms' interests to find a fix that allows them to continue to use tech to disrupt abuse in an end-to-end encrypted world,\\\" he added.And he said that if the tech giants failed to do so, \\\"ultimately government must be the guardrail\\\" to protect children.Facebook has long defended its plans to introduce end-to-end encryption as essential to user privacy.In a statement reacting to the Home Secretary's remarks, a company spokesman said: \\\"Child exploitation has no place on our platforms and Facebook will continue to lead the industry in developing new ways to prevent, detect and respond to abuse.\\\"Its full rollout on our messaging services is a long-term project and we are building strong safety measures into our plans.\\\""},{"author":"By Rebecca Morelle","title":"Nasa's Ingenuity Mars helicopter set for first flight - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-56704481","content":"Nasa is set to make history as it attempts to launch a helicopter from the surface of Mars.If successful, it would be the first powered, controlled flight on another planet.The demonstration should see the Mars-copter - called Ingenuity - rise to about 3m, hover for roughly 30 seconds, swivel and then land.But with never-tried-before technology and challenging flying conditions, the flight will be difficult to pull off.\\\"It feels absolutely nuts,\\u201D says Farah Alibay, a systems engineer at Nasa\\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).\\\"We've been flying on Earth for just over 100 years, and now we're like, 'yeah, we're gonna go to another planet and fly'. It's crazy. But that's the beauty of exploration. That's the beauty of engineering.\\u201DIngenuity is scheduled for lift-off at 07:30 GMT (08:30 BST) on Monday. The first data revealing whether the chopper experiment worked should start arriving back at Earth some three hours later.This information has to be relayed through Nasa's Perseverance rover and a satellite at Mars that will beam it to JPL.Where will the flight take place?The Perseverance Rover landed in a region of the Red Planet called Jezero Crater. The robot carried the helicopter beneath it as it made the perilous descent to Mars' surface in February.Perseverance then drove to an \\\"airstrip\\\" about 20m away from its landing site, lowering Ingenuity to the ground and taking a selfie of the two of them.Engineers say the helicopter looks in good shape for its test flight. A software patch to take care of a technical glitch was installed and tested in recent days, but everything should now be ready for the big moment.A full-speed rotor run-up was performed on Friday.\\\"We have fully confirmed that Ingenuity has enough energy and power to perform this flight at Mars,\\\" said MiMi Aung, Ingenuity project manager, at a pre-flight press briefing.If the flight works, a further four flights will be attempted over the coming days, each one taking the helicopter further afield.What makes flying on Mars so hard?The atmosphere on Mars is extremely thin - about 1% of the density here on Earth - and this doesn't give the helicopter much air to \\\"bite\\\" into.The pull of gravity on the Red Planet is less, which helps - but even so engineers have had to build their chopper very light. It has a mass of just 1.8kg (4lb).The two 1.2m-long rotors spin in opposite directions at up to 2,500rpm. This is extremely fast - indeed, the rotor tips will be moving at about two-thirds of the speed of sound on Mars. This should provide the lift Ingenuity needs.Nasa has been keeping an eye on the winds in Jezero. These could measure up to 20m per second - faster than what was tested on Earth. But the team believes the helicopter will cope.What images will we see?Ingenuity has two cameras onboard.A black-and-white camera that points down to the ground, which is used for navigation, and a high-resolution colour camera that looks out to the horizon.The rover will also be snapping away from a distance of about 65m. It will be using its zoom cameras to try to get some close-ups of the action. With luck we should also get to see some video.All this has its complications as well. Both the rover and helicopter function autonomously and carry separate clocks. The timing devices will need to be in sync for the photography to work.Key frames have already been selected for priority return in the data downlink on Monday.

In a statement on Twitter, the Board said it would make a decision \\\"in the coming weeks\\\".The ruling will be the biggest decision the Oversight Board has had to make since it started taking on cases last year.The Board was set up to rule on difficult or controversial moderation decisions made by Facebook.The 20-member committee, established by Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, is often referred to as \\\"Facebook's Supreme Court\\\". It operates as an independent entity, although its wages and others costs are covered by the tech company.The committee is made up of journalists, human rights activists, lawyers and academics.The group has already ruled on nine cases including:Big Tech bans TrumpIt's not just Mr Trump's account that is banned. Earlier this month Facebook extended their ban to include the \\\"voice of Trump\\\" after his daughter-in-law and Fox News contributor Laura Trump posted a video of her interviewing the former president.Several Big Tech platforms took action after the Capitol Hill riots that left five people dead and more than 100 police officers injured. The former president was accused of inciting violence and repeatedly spreading disinformation.He is suspended on YouTube, but chief executive Susan Wojcicki has said they may lift the ban when the threat of \\\"real-world violence\\\" decreases.He is permanently banned on Twitter.According to data from CrowdTangle, some of Mr Trump's Facebook posts were among the most popular in the US.It has been a few months without Mr Trump on social media and with the threat of that being permanent, he has been considering creating a platform of his own.Trump adviser Jason Miller told Fox News in March that he expects the former Republican president will return with his \\\"own platform\\\".A huge decision for Facebook delayedIt's hard to understate Facebook's use to Donald Trump.He and his high-profile supporters expertly used the platform to drum up support.Regularly his updates would be some of the most read, shared and commented-on posts on the platform.His ability to bypass traditional media and speak directly to people on social media was a key plank of Trumpism.This decision then is hugely important to Mr Trump's future political ambitions.And if you look at the decisions that the Oversight Board has already made, he has reason to be optimistic.In making its decisions, the board has to try to weigh up the rights of freedom of expression with public safety. For most of their rulings so far this year they have erred on the side of free speech.No-platforming works - we have not heard much from Trump since his election defeat. His megaphone has been taken away, and he desperately wants it back.He's talked about launching his own social media platform - but building a social network takes time and there are no guarantees of success.A far easier route to social media influence would be for Facebook to allow him back."},{"author":"By Jonty Bloom","title":"How product placements may soon be added to classic films - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56758376","content":"Product placement is big business for movies and TV series alike, and items can now be added digitally to films and programmes both new and old.Fans of classic war flicks will know the scene - actor Steve McQueen revs his motorcycle furiously as he is chased by German soldiers.Hoping to use the bike to jump over a barbed wire border fence, and reach safety in Switzerland, he pauses to gather his thoughts by a barn.On the side of the building is a big poster advertising a best-selling beer.You don't remember the billboard advert? Well it might not have been there the last time you watched The Great Escape, but it could well be the next.Product placement in films is almost as old as the movie industry itself. The first example of the phenomenon is said to be the 1919 Buster Keaton comedy The Garage, which featured the logos of petrol firms and motor oil companies.Fast-forward to 2019, and the total global product placement industry, across films, TV shows and music videos, was said to be worth $20.6bn (£15bn) that year, according to a report by data analysis firm PQ Media. It is highly lucrative to get a show's leading actor to wear a certain item of clothing, or drink a particular coffee, or drive a specific car.But while previously the product had to actually, physically be there when the shots were filmed, the advertising industry is now turning to technology that can seamlessly insert computer-generated images.So items can be digitally added to almost any movie or TV show. For example, advertisers could put new labels on the champagne bottles in Rick's Cafe in Casablanca, add different background neon advertising signs to Ocean's 11, or get Charlie Chaplin to promote a fizzy drink.And then a few weeks, months or years later the added products can be easily switched to different brands.One of the firms that has developed the ability to do this is UK advertising business Mirriad. Its technology is now being used by a Chinese video streaming website, and the makers of hit US TV show Modern Family have also tried it out.Mirriad's chief executive Stephan Beringer expects such digital product placement to become widespread. His firm came up with the process after previously making movie special effects.\\\"We started out working in movies,\\\" he says. \\\"Our chief scientist Philip McLauchlan, with his team, came up with the technology that won an Academy Award for the film Black Swan.\\\"The technology can 'read' an image, it understands the depth, the motion, the fabric, anything. So you can introduce new images that basically the human eye does not realise has been done after the fact, after the production.\\\"The technological development comes at a time when product placement is ever more important for advertisers, rising 15% in value globally in 2019, according to the PQ Media report. After all, most of us are increasingly streaming films and TV shows via services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, which do not have advertisement breaks.But this high-tech product placement isn't limited to films and TV programmes. The music industry, hit by Covid-19 making touring impossible, and still recovering from the loss of CD sales, is keen to get in on the act.James Sandom is the managing director of UK-based Red Light Management, which represents musicians and bands including Kaiser Chiefs and Franz Ferdinand.He believes that many musicians will leap at the chance to add digital product placement to their music videos both new and old. \\\"The opportunity to carve open a new revenue stream is rare, and the ability to retrospectively use existing content and build new content with it in mind is exciting,\\\" he says.So older musical groups could make new money from videos that might be decades old. And current artists who proudly sport the latest trainers, phones or bags, could have them changed a year later to the newest designs, without them having to actually put them on, or re-record a video.Colombian singer Giovanny Ayala is one of the first artists to use Mirriad's technology, which has enabled him to sign a deal with Mexican brewer Tecate, to have its bottles and logo appear in his music videos.Mr Beringer says that the next leap forward will be the ability to digitally add product banners to live sports or concert broadcasts \\\"in real time, or milliseconds after\\\".\\\"There is huge demand for that,\\\" he says. \\\"So a penalty or VAR decision in football could see a new advert pop up behind the referee.\\\"Roy Taylor, the chief executive of Californian-based business Ryff, says his firm is taking digital product insertion one stage further.It has developed the technology whereby the product placement is targeted at individuals, and changes depending on who is watching.So if you like wine then the hero of a film could be drinking a particular bottle that you might be tempted to try. Or if you are teetotal the star might be sipping on a bottle of branded water.New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.Ryff can do this if you are watching a film on a laptop, smartphone or smart TV, by tracking what you previously bought or looked at online. It works in the same way that online adverts pop up on websites based on your past purchasing or viewing history.\\\"The technology is an attractive bridge between the demand for high-quality content free from intrusive advertising, and alternative sources of content provider revenue,\\\" says Mr Taylor.Cleopatra Veloutsou, professor of brand management at the Adam Smith Business School at Glasgow University, says these technological developments come as movie and TV advertising firms are trying to catch up with their online peers. \\\"They have lost a lot of income, they are trying to find creative ways to catch up,\\\" she says.However, associating your product with a particular film, TV programme or musical artist comes with risk, says Tamsin McLaren, a lecturer in marketing at the University of Bath's School of Management. \\\"Things can go awry if there is a scandal or PR backlash,\\\" she says.And film critic Anne Billson cautions that digital product placement raises both legal questions and those of artistic integrity.\\\"I would be interested in finding out about the legal angle vis-à-vis digital reworking of a copyrighted work, or whether the advertisers would have to buy the film before they tampered with it,\\\" she says.\\\"It also calls into question the role of the production designer, who has put a lot of thought into the look of something, only for some random advertiser to come along at a later date and spoil it with changes or additions that might be anachronistic, or that might not mesh with their other carefully considered design choices.\\\"So to return to Steve McQueen, the so-called \\\"king of cool\\\". While his image is still used to advertise everything from watches to cars, clothes and whisky, retrofitting product placements into his movies would be a step too far for some."},{"author":"By David Silverberg","title":"Smaller and better smartphone cameras are on the way - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56237991","content":"\\\"Today's smartphone cameras can make a better image than cameras I paid NZ$10,000 ($7,110; £5,165) for only 20 years ago,\\\" says Tom Ang, an Auckland-based professional photographer and author of more than 30 books on digital photography.The cameras embedded in our smartphones have become so good, many of those too young to remember anything different would scoff at the idea of carting around a separate camera.While Mr Ang is still fond of his high-end DSLR cameras, most of us rely on smartphone photos and videos to capture our memorable events and duckface selfies.And there is plenty of room for improvement. Most smartphones use a stacked system of lenses, which adds both weight and bulk, and ruins a phone's sleek design on its backside.But that could all change in the near future with new lens technology, including improved camera zooming and features that mean brighter photos, all while reducing the space and weight this takes up on your handset.When you want to zoom in while using your smartphone camera, you have to pinch the screen.The phone's software is cropping the frame and blowing it up, so the image quality is getting worse and can result in blurry photos.At Scope Photonics in Ontario, Canada, they want to create lossless zoom for all kinds of images, which means any photo enjoying a close-up will remain consistently sharp.Chief executive Holden Beggs and his team have been working on a type of technology harnessing liquid crystals, made popular by liquid-crystal display (LCD) screens found in living rooms and retail displays across the world.More Technology of BusinessScope Photonics has found a way to make liquid crystals \\\"spin like tops\\\" and reorganise themselves based on how light moves through them. The effect is to mimic a zoom lens system.So instead of a series of lenses, Scope's system can zoom in and out with just the one lens.The International Runner Up for the 2020 James Dyson Award, Scope is prototyping the lens technology on medical devices first, and aims to bring these lenses to smartphone cameras in three years.\\\"I'm comfortable in predicting we can achieve 10 times zoom with our liquid crystals, but this innovation offers a lot of opportunity for growth so you never know where we'll be at in a few years' time,\\\" Mr Beggs says.Emerging from Cambridge, Massachusetts, another start-up wants to get rid of that \\\"camera bump\\\" found on the back of your smartphone and brighten and sharpen images at the same time.Our phones use plastic and glass lens elements stacked over an image sensor, but Metalenz's design harnesses a single lens built on a glass wafer between just one and three square millimetres in size.Its silicon nanostructures manipulate light rays in a way that allows for brighter and sharper images compared to standard lens elements.Chief executive Robert Devlin says Metalenz is also working on fine-tuning the focus application on cameras, including for video imaging.\\\"We want to improve real-time auto-focus, so the camera is picking out the right object to put into focus,\\\" he says.Another sector Metalenz is eyeing is virtual reality and augmented reality, which require headsets and goggles made up of image sensors and lenses.\\\"In virtual reality especially, those companies want to reduce the bulkiness of those headsets, and that's what we want to do, and it's what we do now with our very thin lenses,\\\" Mr Devlin says.In Utah, a group of researchers have developed a lens a hundred times lighter and a thousand times thinner than the iPhone 11's lenses.Rajesh Menon, associate professor in electrical and computer engineering at Utah University, says a common problem for current phone cameras is spotting out-of-focus reds and blues and correcting - that often requires an additional lens.The lens he helped create comprises thousands of microstructures instead of one large curved element. All these programmed microstructures focus light on an image sensor in the same way as thicker traditional lenses.\\\"Its thinness is a feature, not a by-product,\\\" says Prof Menon. \\\"When you can reduce the size of all the lenses you normally have in a camera, which are all designed to correct for colour aberrations, one single lens can simplify the process.\\\"Reducing the weight of imaging devices, even if it's just a fraction of a gram, can be a big deal for delicate technologies such as satellites and drones, he adds.Prof Menon predicts his team's lens technology will come to smartphones in three to five years. Currently, his technology is being tested on imaging projects led by the US Department of Defense.It is apparent lens innovation is moving at a quick pace, but firms also have to remember that smartphone users are accustomed to simplicity.\\\"If you offer, say, true optical zoom on a smartphone that rivals proper cameras, you also raise the barrier to use. If people need an instruction manual for their smartphone camera, you've stuffed up,\\\" says Mr Ang."},{"author":"By Joe Tidy","title":"Omegle: 'I'm being used as sex-baiting bot' on video chat site - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-56668156","content":"Warning: this story contains disturbing adult themes.Michael was 14 when he first went on to the video chat site Omegle.He'd heard about it at school and was intrigued by its notorious reputation for unpredictable and weird encounters.Within a few hours of being paired at random with strangers, he says he was linked up with an older woman who persuaded him to show her his penis.\\\"I'm not sure if she was an adult or not, but she was definitely older than me,\\\" he says.\\\"I can remember her asking if I wanted to see her naked. She invited me to jerk off to her. I did it because I was stupid. If I could go back, then I would stop myself.\\\"Michael logged off shortly afterwards and continued to worry about the incident.'I got addicted'Global child protection charities and police forces from multiple countries have become increasingly concerned about Omegle which has surged in popularity during the pandemic.Michael says he was drawn back to the site a few years ago as an 18-year-old and became addicted.\\\"I started going on the site again and started doing 'stuff' on camera with different people. Video sex.\\\"What Michael didn't realise was that at least one of these intimate video calls had been recorded.It was during a moment of lockdown boredom that he discovered the video was being used to trick others into sexual activity.\\\"I'd quit the site for over a year but one afternoon I randomly got paired with a video of myself on the website doing 18+ stuff. Someone had recorded me masturbating and had been using it for at least a year.\\\"Michael says he was horrified to see the old video of himself going through the process of undressing then masturbating, all while the mystery person or computer program pretending to be him typed things to encourage Michael to join in.Tricking people into sexTo make chats more anonymous, many people on Omegle choose to obscure their faces on video and talk through the text chat.Michael (who did not want to share his real name) says the interaction was convincing.\\\"It was like a fully advanced system with different video sequences of me doing different stuff.\\\"The 21-year-old from Scandinavia says he is sharing his story because he wants people to learn from his experience and question who is on the other side of the video call.'Constantly stressed'\\\"I am constantly stressed about it, but I find peace that at least my face is not in it.

I think in Michael's case though, it's likely that there is a human 'operator' behind the scenes who is clicking through the sequence of actions on Omegle to make it more believable.\\\"Omegle has been criticised by its users and others, including the IWF, of not doing enough to moderate the site, or stop children from accessing it.The UN Human Rights Office's expert investigator on the sale and sexual exploitation of children contacted the BBC following the publication of our previous story.The BBC understands that the office has made contact with Omegle, but the case is in a confidential stage in proceedings.Leif K Brooks is the creator and still runs the website.He says Omegle moderation is carried out by a fully-automated AI service as well as a third-party monitoring firm that has a team monitoring the site 24\\\/7.\\\"The inappropriate behaviour that has occurred, while a very small percentage of the millions of daily interactions, is deeply disturbing to me and unacceptable,\\\" he said.\\\"Omegle is fully committed to addressing the concerns raised so that a small minority of bad actors don't ruin the positive interactions experienced by millions of users.\\\""},{"author":"By Bernd Debusmann Jr","title":"'I put those goggles on and just fell in love' - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56510653","content":"\\\"The first time I put on those goggles and got to experience flight, I just fell in love,\\\" explains Jordan Temkin. \\\"Then I just went down the rabbit hole.\\\"Temkin, also popularly known as Jet, is not an aircraft pilot, nor a skydiver. He is, however, a two-time world champion in the rapidly growing world of first-person view (FPV) drone racing.Originally a niche sport that began with semi-organised events in locations ranging from Australia to Germany between 2011 and 2013, FPV drone racing, in which the pilots wear head-mounted displays that show a live stream camera feed from the drone, has become a sizeable industry.According to data from Polaris Market Research, the global drone racing market size is expected to grow from $412m (£300m) in 2019 to $2.1bn (£1.5bn) by 2026.Around the world several organisations and governing bodies have been established to organise FPV drone racing events but the most high-profile is the Drone Racing League (DRL).Using custom-built drones designed to travel at speeds of up to 90mph (145km\\\/h), DRL holds races at venues around the world, including the Allianz Riviera stadium in Nice, France, Alexandra Palace in London, and Gardens by the Bay in Singapore.DRL founder Nicholas Horbaczewski, formerly the chief revenue officer of the Tough Mudder endurance event series, explains that as recently as 2015, drone racing was still \\\"underground\\\", with a small but dedicated group of enthusiasts exchanging information on message boards. They built drones with parts ordered from the web and met in fields and car parks to race.\\\"I got a chance to see it live in 2015, and I just thought it was amazing. It evoked thoughts of Star Wars and sci-fi movies,\\\" he recalls.\\\"It really got me interested in how the sport could go mainstream.\\\"More Technology of BusinessAt the time, however, drone racing was held back by technical limitations. According to Horbaczewski, the homemade technology being used by drone racing's early pioneers wasn't sufficient to build a sport that could be broadcast in front of a live audience or on TV.\\\"It simply wasn't robust or reliable enough. While the concept was really appealing, it only worked as an amateur sport,\\\" he says.\\\"So we stepped back and became a technology company. We raised venture capital, and we built a team of engineers and we built industrialised, professional equipment to enable a grander scale of drone racing.\\\"Fast forward to 2020, and DRL is broadcast on the likes of NBC, Twitter and Sky Sports and boasts high-profile sponsors.Temkin believes the mass proliferation of recreational drones, including purpose-built recreational FPV drones released this year, means the sport is on the cusp of a new era of growth, with new participants and viewers on the horizon.\\\"It's a language that people who don't speak the same language can communicate with. All these people around the world have the same love for the flight of racing drones. It's an experience we all share,\\\" he says.\\\"And now there's a group of teenagers coming up who have been flying since they were children. That's another level of skill and understanding.\\\"In the case of DRL, the league received an unexpected boost during the 2020 season when, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, competitions were held virtually using a drone racing simulator available on Xbox and software distribution platform Steam. The sport already had a digital element, with pilots trying out to be a part of the league through a simulator.\\\"As a sport, drone racing has a blurry line between the digital and the real. It has an element of e-sports. You have pilots sitting there holding controllers, looking at screens. In some cases they're controlling real-life drones, and in some places creating virtual drones,\\\" Temkin says.\\\"We can move seamlessly between the two, and our fans love that.\\\"In January, DRL partnered with American sports betting operator DraftKings to become the first drone racing organisation that will let people bet on drone races, a potentially lucrative development that some analysts believe portends the future of the sport.According to Chris Altruda, a sports betting industry analyst with Pennbets.com, over the coming years the success of drone racing as a betting sport will most likely be determined by how successful it is in attracting Generation Z, those who are beginning to enter the coveted advertising demographic of the over-25s.At the moment, however, a number of factors are holding back the sport. Jean-Francois Denis, the executive director of the Coventry-based International Universities Drone Racing Organisation, says that despite growing popularity, audience size still faces issues when compared to other sports - particularly motorsports.\\\"The creation of drone racing as a pilot-centric sport has resulted in an entertainment format that's undeniably exciting for the participant, and somewhat confusing for first-glance potential spectators,\\\" he says.\\\"For this sport to have a competing chance against its motorsport peers, it needs to think beyond its current state.\\\"Timothy Crofts, the president of the Australian FPV Association, says regulation could also hold back the sport.\\\"I think what the sport needs most right now is support from government bodies to make sure it can continue to exist as a sport in the years to come,\\\" Crofts says. \\\"It's currently at risk around the world as laws are changing to make it more restrictive and difficult to participate in.\\\"In the longer term, industry insiders believe that the popularity of drones among even younger people will translate to more interest in racing.Jenny Mirkovic, the chief operating officer of AirVuz, a Minneapolis-based firm that specialises in drone content creation and sponsors several FPV racers, says that the sport is becoming \\\"incredibly accessible\\\", even for teenagers still at school.\\\"My daughter is in high school, and her school has a drone racing team,\\\" she says. \\\"It's pretty easy to get into it, and the drones themselves aren't very expensive. There's a low barrier to entry.\\\"The spread of FPV drone racing, she adds, is bolstered by the now widespread availability of footage posted online. A viral video of an FPV drone flying through a bowling alley that was released earlier in March, for example, quickly amassed nearly 2 million views.\\\"Kids are excited by the video content, and then by the sport,\\\" Mirkovic says. \\\"It's an exciting time and a great place for all these things to meet up.\\\"Jordan Temkin, for his part, believes the future of the sport is bright.\\\"What we do in the next five years will be amazing. I really do think that this industry is just getting bigger and bigger.\\\""},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Mother turned into 'ghost' gamer for homeless charity - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-england-nottinghamshire-56675233","content":"A self-confessed \\\"gaming nerd\\\" is turning her mother into a gamer to raise money for a homeless charity.Caroline Hannigan, 30, and Doralena Harris, from Long Eaton, Derbyshire, have teamed up to support Level Up, a campaign by Nottingham-based Framework.The charity wants to give more young people access to phones and computers to help them find work and support.Ms Harris, who had only ever played Candy Crush before, said she had enjoyed embracing the gamer life.'Ghost helper'The mother and grandmother has kicked things off with a game called Cozy Grove, but her daughter hopes to move her on to more challenging fare.\\\"I do find the game very rewarding because basically you're helping a ghost,\\\" Ms Harris said.\\\"When you're helping somebody it's like you're achieving something.Ms Hannigan, who said she had been passionate about gaming since being taught by her brother at the age of four, said her mother was \\\"actually really good\\\".She said when she had told her brother about the challenge, he had \\\"laughed hysterically\\\" and wished her \\\"good luck\\\".The pair are hoping to raise at least £300 for Framework, a charity close to the family's heart.Ms Harris moved to the UK from Colombia but ran into financial trouble after returning to her home country to support her sick father.She said: \\\"When I came back everything was repossessed.

It's prompted some people to send abusive messages.\\\"We must be approaching about 300 emails accusing us of things like being a part of a 'medical apartheid.'\\\"George Wood is managing director of The Luna Cinema, which runs open-air film events. He agreed to participate in the government's pilot scheme to restart large-scale gatherings - but he didn't expect to receive abuse for doing so.The emails accuse Luna of being part of a \\\"vaccine passport\\\" scheme - even though attendees won't have to show proof of vaccination, only evidence of a recent negative Covid-19 test.The abuse includes personal attacks and even messages comparing the organisers to Nazis.\\\"These claims are so ridiculous,\\\" says Mr Wood. \\\"The staff are being distressed by it.\\\"We are doing something positive for the industry,\\\" he says. \\\"We're helping return the freedoms that have been removed by Covid.\\\"Mr Wood says that many of the people writing in used the same slogans and phrases, which seemed to indicate a co-ordinated campaign. And he says some of the more extreme messages have been referred to the police.HarassmentThe targeting of The Luna Cinema isn't unique. The BBC has seen details posted online - including phone numbers and email addresses - of several people involved in a number of the mass event pilots.In one group of nearly 16,000 people on the chat app Telegram, contact details of organisers of the events were for a time pinned to the top of the chat. The group itself is devoted to Covid-19 and vaccine conspiracy theories.One post reads: \\\"Help Kill The Government Trials That Will Inevitably Bring In Vaccine Passports\\\", and goes on to list contact email addresses for organisers.Other posts, like this one, declare that the events \\\"must fail\\\":While the messages avoid specific calls to action, participants in the chat are prodded with phrases like \\\"YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO\\\". As Mr Wood's experience shows, some may interpret that as a sign to send abuse.What are the pilots?The government is collecting data and research from a number of pilots around the country, including Sunday's FA Cup semi-final at Wembley Stadium, the World Snooker Championships in Sheffield and a number of other smaller events.Findings from these events on testing, social distancing and ventilation will inform how mass venues can reopen safely after 21 June, when all lockdown measures are currently planned to be lifted.The government's initial statement on the pilots referred to \\\"Covid-status certification\\\". However that phrase appears to have initially caused some confusion, with some interpreting it as a signal that participants would be required to show proof of a Covid vaccination.One venue, Liverpool's Hot Water Comedy Club, pulled out from the trial because of abuse over inaccurate reports it was involved in a \\\"vaccine passport\\\" trial.The cancellation was cheered in anti-vaccine groups.While there has been debate about the ethics of \\\"vaccine passports\\\" and the government has launched a review into Covid-status certification, the only requirement for entry into the mass event trials is a negative Covid test.'Covid passports'As the exact requirements for the trials have become clearer, however, chat in more extreme anti-lockdown, anti-vaccine groups hasn't subsided. Instead, people consistently talk about the trials bringing in \\\"vaccine passports\\\" by the back door.Posts contain a range of suspicions - from mainstream worries about discrimination, all the way to hard-core conspiracy theories that the pandemic is somehow a \\\"hoax\\\" or has been \\\"fabricated\\\", alongside patently false assertions that vaccines are harming and killing millions.Some claim, again falsely, that Covid testing itself is somehow dangerous. There is also content from far-right activists.\\\"In terms of the broader Covid conspiracy and anti-lockdown groups, threats and potential violence against people who may be talking about how society changes because of Covid are quite common,\\\" says Ciaran O'Connor, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.\\\"The thing about Telegram is that it's anonymous.

They come at a tense time for relations between the two countries.Last month the US targeted seven Russian officials and more than a dozen government entities over the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. Russia says it was not involved.In a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, Mr Biden vowed to defend US national interests \\\"firmly\\\", while proposing a meeting with Mr Putin to find areas where the two countries could work together.What did the Biden administration say?On Thursday, Mr Biden described his decision to impose sanctions on Russia as \\\"proportionate\\\".\\\"I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so,\\\" Mr Biden told reporters. \\\"The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia.\\\"He added that the way forwards is through \\\"thoughtful dialogue and diplomatic process\\\".A statement from the White House said the new sanctions show the US \\\"will impose costs in a strategic and economically impactful manner on Russia\\\" if it continues its \\\"destabilising international action\\\".It reaffirms the administration's view that the Russian government is behind cyber-attacks and has been trying to \\\"undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections\\\" in the US and allied nations.It specifically blames Russia's foreign intelligence service, the SVR, for the SolarWinds attack, which gave cyber-criminals potential access to 18,000 government and private computer networks.Last December, then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he believed Russia was behind it.The latest sanctions target 32 entities and officials accused of trying to influence the 2020 US presidential election \\\"and other acts of disinformation\\\".Ten diplomats are being expelled. The executive order also bars US financial institutions from purchasing rouble-denominated bonds from June.Biden treads a careful lineThe Biden administration is trying to tread a careful line. US officials want to impose costs for a range of unacceptable behaviour from Moscow and deter further acts. They also want to signal they are going to take a tougher line than the Trump administration. But they also say they do not want to see a downward spiral in relations. The message they have is that their response is \\\"resolute but proportionate\\\".The SolarWinds cyber-espionage campaign was a primary concern. To maximise the impact they have combined response to this with sanctions over election interference and other issues.Diplomatic expulsions and sanctions against individuals will largely be shrugged off by Moscow as expected. The financial sanctions regarding Russian sovereign debt are a step-up though.The US has also published a huge amount of detail about Russian intelligence activities ranging from front companies involved in spreading disinformation to Russian tech companies allegedly supporting its intelligence services.The hope will be that this also makes it harder for the Russians to operate. But past experience suggests all of this is unlikely to deter the Kremlin.The White House meanwhile acknowledged there was little evidence to support claims that Russia had offered bounties to Taliban militants for killing American soldiers.The intelligence assessment was first reported last June by the New York Times, and was cited by Mr Biden on the campaign trial last year to accuse then-President Donald Trump of not standing up to Russia. Mr Trump at the time called it \\\"fake news\\\".On Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters the intelligence community had determined it had only \\\"low to moderate confidence\\\" in the claims, which are said to have come from interrogations of Afghan detainees.What is the reaction from Moscow?Shortly after the sanctions were announced, Russia's foreign ministry called them \\\"hostile steps which dangerously raise the temperature of confrontation\\\".\\\"Such aggressive conduct will of course get a decisive response,\\\" the statement added.The US ambassador has been called to the foreign ministry.The EU, Nato and the UK have all issued statements in support of the US measures.What's the background?In his first foreign policy speech in February, Mr Biden vowed to stand up to Russia. \\\"The days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions\\u2026 are over,\\\" he said.The Obama-Biden administration was accused of standing by while Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.But in recent days Mr Biden has warned the Kremlin against aggressive actions in Ukraine. Russia is beefing up its military presence in the border area.Mr Biden's predecessor rarely criticised Mr Putin. In a report last month US intelligence agencies concluded the Russian president had probably directed online efforts to help Mr Trump win a second term as US president.And yet, according to the Carnegie Moscow Center, Mr Trump imposed a record total of more than 40 rounds of sanctions on Moscow. In 2018 he expelled 60 Russian diplomats from the US.You might also be interested in:"},{"author":"By Helen Briggs","title":"Climate change: Future-proofing coffee in a warming world - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-56804147","content":"Scientists say a \\\"forgotten\\\" coffee plant that can grow in warmer conditions could help future-proof the drink against climate change.They predict we could soon be sipping Coffea stenophylla, a rare wild coffee that tastes like high-quality Arabica coffee, but grows in warmer conditions.As temperatures rise, good coffee will become increasingly difficult to grow.Studies suggest that by 2050, about half of land used for high-quality coffee will be unproductive.To find a wild coffee that tastes great and is heat and drought tolerant is \\\"the holy grail of coffee breeding\\\", said Dr Aaron Davis, head of coffee research at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.\\\"Being somebody who's tasted a lot of wild coffees they're not great, they don't taste like Arabica so our expectations were pretty low,\\\" he told BBC News.\\\"And we were completely blown away by the fact that this coffee tasted amazing. It has these other attributes related to its climate tolerance: it will grow and crop under much warmer conditions than Arabica coffee.\\\"Coffea stenophylla is a wild coffee species from West Africa which, until recently, was thought to be extinct outside Ivory Coast.The plant was recently re-discovered growing wild in Sierra Leone, where it was historically grown as a coffee crop about a century ago.A small sample of coffee beans from Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast were roasted and made into coffee, which was then tasted by a panel of coffee connoisseurs.Over 80% of judges could not tell the difference between Stenophylla and Arabica in blind tastings, the researchers reported in the journal Nature Plants.They also modelled climate data for the plant, which suggests it can potentially tolerate temperatures at least 6C higher than Arabica.Seedlings will be planted this year in order to start assessing the wild coffee's potential in safeguarding the future of high-quality coffee.Dr Davis hopes Stenophylla will one day be grown again in Sierra Leone on a major scale.\\\"It's not going to be in coffee shops in the next couple of years, but I think within five to seven years we'll see it entering the market as a niche coffee, as a high value coffee, and then after that I think it will be more common,\\\" he said.What is Arabica coffee?Arabica beans are deemed to have a superior taste. The coffee is grown in the mountains and accounts for over 60% of the world's coffee production.Arabica has limited resilience to climate change; farmers are already experiencing the impacts of elevated temperatures and low or erratic rainfall.Other threats to coffee production include price fluctuations, pests and diseases, and extreme weather.The research was carried out in collaboration with the French research institute Cirad and the University of Greenwich.Where is wild coffee found?The vast majority of wild coffee grows in the remote forests of Africa and on the island of Madagascar. Beyond Africa, wild coffee is found in other tropical climates, including parts of India, Sri Lanka, and Australia.What types of coffee do we drink?More than 100 types of coffee tree grow naturally in forests, but only a handful are used for drinking.The global coffee industry is dominated by two main coffee crops - Arabica (Coffea arabica) and Robusta (Coffeea canephora).A third species - Liberica (Coffea liberica) is grown around the world, but is rarely used for coffee drinks.Follow Helen on Twitter."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"China and US pledge climate change commitment - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-china-56790077","content":"China and the US say they are committed to working together and with other countries on tackling climate change.It comes after several meetings between Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and his US counterpart John Kerry in Shanghai last week.They both agreed on further specific actions to reduce emissions, a joint statement on Sunday confirmed.US President Joe Biden is holding a virtual climate summit this week, which China says it is looking forward to.However it is not yet known if Chinese President Xi Jinping will join the world leaders who have pledged to attend.\\\"The United States and China are committed to cooperating with each other and with other countries to tackle the climate crisis, which must be addressed with the seriousness and urgency that it demands,\\\" the statement said.It added that both nations will continue to discuss \\\"concrete actions in the 2020s to reduce emissions aimed at keeping the Paris Agreement-aligned temperature limit within reach\\\".Both nations also agreed to help developing countries finance a switch to low-carbon energy.Li Shuo, senior climate adviser for environmental group Greenpeace, described the statement as \\\"positive\\\".\\\"It sends a very unequivocal message that on this particular issue (China and the United States) will co-operate. Before the meetings in Shanghai this was not a message that we could assume, \\\" Mr Li told Reuters news agency.The joint statement - issued symbolically at a round table - will relieve anyone concerned about the planet. It simply won't be possible to stabilise climate change unless the superpower super-polluters pull much harder. A recent report said China, for instance, must close down 588 coal-fired power plants to meet its climate pledges.Is China heading in the right direction on coal? No - its regional governors have been building even more coal plants to stimulate the economy.One outcome from the US-China meeting is the acknowledgement that finance flows should be channelled to low-carbon projects, not high carbon. Both sides have also promised plans for reducing their own emissions further. President Biden will unveil his proposals at or before the US summit this coming week.President Xi is playing coy over whether he'll attend the summit. Instead he may announce tighter Chinese targets at the Boao Forum - a Chinese forum for business and government leaders - also this week. And don't forget: all other nations need to commit to tackling the climate - not just the superpowers.Mr Kerry's trip to China is the first high-level visit by a member of the Biden administration since the new US president took office. However US and Chinese officials met for talks in Alaska last month.Ahead of his trip to Shanghai, Mr Kerry told CNN that China's co-operation was \\\"absolutely critical\\\" to battle the climate crisis.\\\"Yes, we have big disagreements with China on some key issues, absolutely. But climate has to stand alone,\\\" he said.What needs to change?Climate scientists warn that global warming must not rise more than 2C above pre-industrial levels - in fact the aim should be well below this with an increasingly ambitious 1.5C goal, to avoid the worst of climate breakdown.Central to the Paris Agreement are nationally determined contributions (NDCs). These are targets intended to cut emissions.NDCs represent the commitments by each country - under the Paris pact - to reduce their own national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.According to the Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific analysis that tracks government climate action, China's NDC rating is \\\"highly insufficient\\\" and \\\"are not at all consistent with holding warming to below 2C\\\".China has pledged to peak its emissions by 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 (that means cutting out all carbon emissions from fossil fuels but still allowing farm emissions of methane - another planet-heating gas).However, China is currently running 1,058 coal plants - more than half the world's capacity.The US, meanwhile, has the worst NDC rating of \\\"critically insufficient\\\" on the Climate Action Tracker.The US was absent from climate negotiations during President Donald Trump's term of office and it is now being urged to cut emissions to between 57% and 63% below 2005 levels this decade.You may also be interested in:"},{"author":"Jonathan Amos","title":"A68: Iceberg that became a social media star melts away - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-56779687","content":"The iceberg that was for a time the biggest in the world is no more.A68, as it was known, covered an area of nearly 6,000 sq km (2,300 sq miles) when it broke away from Antarctica in 2017.That's like a small country; it's equal to a quarter of the size of Wales.But satellites show the mega-berg has now virtually gone, broken into countless small fragments that the US National Ice Center says are no longer worth tracking.A68 calved from the Larson C Ice Shelf on the edge of the Antarctic Peninsula, and for a year it hardly moved. But then it started to drift north with increasing speed, riding on strong currents and winds.The billion-tonne block took a familiar route, spinning out into the South Atlantic towards the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia. The small island is where many of the biggest icebergs go to die. Caught in the local shallows, they are doomed to gradually melt away.But this one somehow managed to escape that particular fate.Instead, it was the waves, the warm water and higher air temperatures in the Atlantic that eventually consumed A68. It simply shattered into smaller and smaller fragments.\\\"It's amazing that A68 lasted as long as it did,\\\" Adrian Luckman, from Swansea University, told BBC News.\\\"If you think about the thickness ratio - it's like four pieces of A4 paper stacked up on top of one another. So this thing is incredibly flexible and fragile as it moved around the ocean. It lasted for years like that. But it eventually broke into four-to-five pieces and then those broke up as well.\\\"Born into the age of satellitesA68 will probably be best remembered as the first iceberg to become a star on social media.People around the world shared satellite pictures online, especially as the frozen block neared South Georgia. Had it grounded, the berg's immense bulk could have disrupted the foraging behaviour of the island's many penguins - and who isn't worried about penguins in peril?The daily conversation on the likes of Twitter and Instagram was made possible by today's easy access to a suite of publicly available space data tools.\\\"A68 caught the attention of a lot of different people,\\\" commented Laura Gerrish, a mapping specialist with the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). \\\"We saw every little twist and turn. We were able to follow its progress with daily satellite images, at a level of detail we've not really been able to do before.\\\"What did we learn from A68?Of course, the iceberg wasn't just an object of wonder; it was also the target of some serious scientific investigation.Its place of origin, Larsen C, is an enormous floating platform of ice, built by the merging of glacier tongues that have slid off the land into the ocean.A68's life story will almost certainly tell researchers something both about how ice shelves are constructed and how they break apart to produce icebergs.\\\"The one thing that is probably worth mentioning as a scientific result was how much was learned about the fracture toughness of the suture zones where inland glaciers joined together to form the floating shelf ice,\\\" commented Christopher Shuman from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) and Nasa-Goddard.\\\"Because we had new sensors seeing the rift evolution more frequently, I'm sure useful insights were gleaned that could not have been 'seen' in the decade before. This is a real testament to the investments being made in Earth observation.\\\"Most glaciologists regard A68 as the product of a very natural process. Ice shelves will maintain an equilibrium, and the ejection of bergs is one way they balance the accumulation of mass from snowfall and the input of more ice from the feeding glaciers on land.So in that sense, A68 cannot be presented as a poster child for human-induced climate change.All that said, A68 did showcase the sorts of processes through which warming can destroy ice structures.How ice turns to mush very quicklyOne of these is what's termed hydrofracturing. In this process, warming produces a lot of surface meltwater that then fills fissures and cracks, driving these openings through to the base of the ice.There were some spectacular examples towards the end of A68's existence where hydrofracturing turned remnant fragments to mush almost overnight.\\\"'Death by hydrofracture', 'slush puppies',\\\" Ted Scambos called it. \\\"Another example of iceberg fast-forward evolution, showing us how ice shelves might collapse in a warmer world. I guess the iceberg tested a lot of supposed knowledge, and the knowledge mostly stood up to the challenge,\\\" the CIRES-University of Colorado Boulder expert told BBC News.Robots sent to investigateBAS also put a couple of robots in the ocean in February to try to study up close some of A68's latter-day segments.One went missing soon after, and the other actually got stuck under the ice for two weeks before managing to free itself and continue its observations.This robot will be recovered in May to pull down its data. It should reveal information about how icebergs affect their surroundings by, for example, dumping huge volumes of fresh water into the ocean as they melt.How it all ended last weekThe USNIC is the body recognised internationally for naming icebergs and tracking those that might pose a threat to shipping.To make it on to the USNIC list of concern, a berg must either have a long-axis of greater than 10 nautical miles (18.5km) or an area of at least 20 square nautical miles (68.5 sq km).None of A68's fragments now qualify. The last major piece, known as A68a, was measured on Friday to be just 3 nautical miles by 2 nautical miles.

The total value of the contract awarded to Musk's company is $2.89bn.\\\"With this award, Nasa and our partners will complete the first crewed demonstration mission to the surface of the Moon in the 21st century as the agency takes a step forward for women's equality and long-term deep space exploration,\\\" said Kathy Lueders, the organisation's head of human exploration.\\\"This critical step puts humanity on a path to sustainable lunar exploration and keeps our eyes on missions farther into the Solar System, including Mars.\\\"The Artemis programme, initiated under the Trump administration, had targeted a return to the lunar surface in 2024.

In a statement, Ms Lueders said that \\\"while it remains the agency's desire to preserve a competitive environment at this stage of the HLS program\\\", its current budget precluded it from selecting two companies, as it was expected to.Cost is believed to have been a major factor; SpaceX's bid was the lowest of the three competitors \\\"by a wide margin\\\".Ms Lueders explained: \\\"I made a determination that it would be in the agency's best interests to make an initial, conditional selection of SpaceX.\\\"The decision has caused a stir in Congress.

It is being run by an interim administrator, and Mr Biden's pick to run the agency - former senator and astronaut Bill Nelson - will appear at his confirmation hearing next week.\\\"I am disappointed that the acting Nasa leadership decided to make such a consequential award prior to the arrival of a new permanent Nasa administrator and deputy administrator,\\\" said congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, the democrat chair of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology.\\\"The decision to make the award today also comes despite the obvious need for a re-baselining of Nasa's lunar exploration program, which has no realistic chance of returning US astronauts to the Moon by 2024.\\\"Nasa is targeting the Moon's South Polar region for the first landing with astronauts since 1972. This area holds abundant deposits of water-ice, which could be turned into rocket fuel and breathable air to support a future lunar base.But touching down here also presents challenges, because the angle of the Sun casts long shadows that obscure surface features as the craft comes down to land.Engineers will need to navigate the problem as they refine their plans for the first Artemis landing.SpaceX had been in a run-off against the National Team - consisting of Blue Origin (founded by Bezos), Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper - and defence contractor Dynetics.It represents another milestone for the 19-year-old company founded by Musk, which initially had to overcome widespread scepticism about its plans to bring down the costs of spaceflight. SpaceX almost ran out of money, but was kept going by a fortuitous contract award from Nasa in 2008.Since then, it has achieved huge success launching commercial satellites and picked up a lucrative contract to fly people to the ISS.The Starship vehicle is currently being tested at a facility in Boca Chica, South Texas. A number of uncrewed prototypes have already been launched to altitudes of 10km or more, before being brought back down in an attempt to land them softly on the ground. However, the last few test flights ended with the vehicles exploding, either close to or on the pad after their return.\\\"This is an exciting time for Nasa and especially the Artemis team,\\\" said Lisa Watson-Morgan, programme manager for the Human Landing System at the agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville.\\\"During the Apollo programme, we proved that it is possible to do the seemingly impossible: land humans on the Moon. By taking a collaborative approach in working with industry while leveraging Nasa's proven technical expertise and capabilities, we will return American astronauts to the Moon's surface once again, this time to explore new areas for longer periods of time.\\\"The Artemis programme aims to establish a long-term presence on the Moon, including the establishment of a lunar base.Follow Paul on Twitter."},{"author":"By Roger Harrabin","title":"China 'can save $1.6 trillion by scrapping coal', report says - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-56761344","content":"China can save up to $1.6 trillion (£1.2 trillion) over 20 years by switching from coal power to renewables, a report says.The authors say China must close 588 coal-fired power plants in a decade to meet climate pledges - but they insist the move will save cash.That's because renewables are now so much cheaper than coal.It mirrors the situation in the US, where coal tumbled from being the cheapest major fuel to the most expensive.China is currently running 1,058 coal plants \\u2013 more than half the world\\u2019s capacity.The authors of the report from the climate think tank, TransitionZero, say to meet its stated goal of becoming \\\"carbon neutral\\\" by 2060, China must take radical action now.China has announced it\\u2019s building five new nuclear stations to supply clean power \\u2013 and President Xi has announced he will join a French-German climate summit on Friday.It's also the world leader in wind turbines and solar panels.But over the past year the country has strayed in a high-carbon direction, with regional governors building new power stations to stimulate economic growth.The report warns that China\\u2019s 14th Five-year Plan risks creating \\u201Cstranded assets\\u201D \\u2013 that\\u2019s coal plants which get built but not used.It\\u2019s based on satellite technology and machine learning, which are being used for the first time to determine exactly how much CO2 China\\u2019s power sector is emitting.Western diplomats have been suspicious about the nation\\u2019s data, which is published on a provincial basis every month.The UK and the US, by comparison, publish CO2 data at plant level every day.

It's already been the cause of a bitter row between the two governments over use of a venue with claims that Number 10 threatened to move the whole thing to London.Since then - and through the pandemic - relations have become more cordial with officials cooperating north and south of the border.Ultimately, it will be for the UK government to decide, in partnership with the United Nations, whether COP26 goes ahead in full, is delayed or taken into the virtual sphere.But it's the Scottish Government's role to look after public health in Glasgow, including that of visitors. And so they effectively have a veto.It would be a brave move of them to use it though. And keep in mind that Downing Street and Bute House have a shared aim on this; they both want success on Scottish soil.As well as ongoing debates about the form of COP26, the question of content is also causing concern.Many important technical issues relating to how countries will make the Paris climate agreement work have been left unsolved for several years.At the last COP, held in Madrid in December 2019, arguments raged about the role of carbon markets and the question of transparency - how can countries trust each other to do what they say they'll do?These issues are still outstanding.The UN hopes that what's termed an \\\"inter-sessional meeting\\\" in Bonn, due in June, would help clear the backlog.Later this week, representatives of regional groupings of countries within the UN system will try and agree the format for this gathering, with the likelihood that it will be virtual.That will be a huge test of both the technical issues and the ability of negotiators to make progress on the stalled agenda items.\\\"I think if that is a successful session, if we do advanced negotiations on issues like carbon markets and transparency and on the budget and we can see progress there, we could then decide if COP26 is going to be able to deliver on something significant,\\\" said Carlos Fuller, senior climate negotiator with Belize.\\\"But certainly, if at the June session, nothing occurs, and we make absolutely no progress, I don't see how even a full in-person COP26 could produce a result.\\\"Underlining the need for progress, the UK has now raised the possibility of an additional meeting, taking place in person, before Glasgow.In fact, across this year there are a number of significant opportunities for politicians to discuss and take steps on climate change, beginning with President Biden's leaders summit taking place virtually on April 22-23.Some see a danger in placing too much of a burden on the Glasgow meeting which might ultimately be limited by the pandemic and ongoing, deep difference between nations.\\\"This COP is not the essence of the system, it will be one more step,\\\" said Portugal's minister for science Manuel Heitor.Portugal currently holds the EU presidency and will play an important role in preparing the Union's approach to the Glasgow conference.\\\"The targets for carbon neutrality need several steps, so this will not be the last COP, it is one additional COP,\\\" he told BBC News.\\\"I believe the best solution is to keep it going, keep taking one more step in this process and to keep the pressure on.\\\"Follow Matt on Twitter."},{"author":"By Helen Briggs","title":"UK woodlands 'at crisis point' amid wildlife decline - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-56738428","content":"A review of the state of Britain's native woods and trees has found only 7% are in a good condition.While woodland cover is slowly increasing, the wildlife within it is decreasing, says the Woodland Trust.If threats to woodland aren't tackled, the UK's ability to tackle climate and nature crises will be \\\"severely damaged\\\", the charity warns.The Woodland Trust is among a number of groups calling for legally binding targets for the recovery of nature.\\\"The warning signs in this report are loud and clear,\\\" says Abi Bunker, director of conservation and external affairs at the Woodland Trust.\\\"If we don't tackle the threats facing our woods and trees, we will severely damage the UK's ability to address the climate and nature crises.\\\"Woodland now covers 13% of UK land, up from 12% in 1998.About half is made up of native tree species, such as oak, beech and ash, including centuries-old ancient woodlands.

And those systems that can capture this detail will lack the wide-area coverage and the timely return to a particular location.The Carbon Mapper project wants to fix this either-or-situation by flying multiple high-resolution (30m) sensors that can deliver a daily view, or better.They will look for super-emitters - the actors responsible for large releases of greenhouse gases. These would include oil and gas infrastructure, or perhaps poorly managed landfills and large dairy factory facilities.Often these emitters want to know they have a problem but just don't have the data to take action.\\\"What we've learned is that decision support systems that focus just at the level of nation states, or countries, are necessary but not sufficient. We really need to get down to the scale of individual facilities, and even individual pieces of equipment, if we're going to have an impact across civil society,\\\" explained Riley Duren, Carbon Mapper's CEO and a research scientist at the University of Arizona.\\\"Super-emitters are often intermittent but they are also disproportionately responsible for the total emissions. That suggests low-hanging fruit, because if you can identify and fix them you can get a big bang for your buck,\\\" he told BBC News.The aim is to put the satellite data in the hands of everyone, and with the necessary tools also to be able to understand and use that information.The project is being supported in large part by philanthropy - from the likes of the High Tide Foundation and Bloomberg.It also has buy-in from the US State of California. State law commits California to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and to eventually get to carbon neutrality.\\\"We can't meet those targets without a focus on methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),\\\" said Richard Corey, executive officer at California's Air Resources Board.\\\"Whether you're talking about oil and gas operations, landfills, wastewater treatment facilities - we know that if we can identify leaks efficiently, they can be repaired. It's about getting that information in front of folks in a timely way. That will make it actionable.\\\"Central to the constellation's success will be the imaging spectrometer technology developed by Nasa.This hyperspectral instrument was developed and refined for airborne use. Now it will go into orbit.The Permian Basin, which straddles Texas and New Mexico, is a major oil and gas production area. These plumes are likely coming from individual well heads and compressor stations. Watch a video of the flyover.The near-500 channels on the sensor can detect and classify all manner of targets and phenomena on the ground, but these bands are also very good at detecting carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere.The Planet company will launch two satellite prototypes in 2023.

During the late Cretaceous Period, when the dinosaurs were still alive, the trees that made up the forests were widely-spaced. The top parts did not overlap, leaving open sunlit areas on the forest floor.But post-impact, forests developed a thick canopy that allowed much less light to reach the ground.So how did the impact transform the sparse, conifer-rich tropical forests of the dinosaur age into the rainforests of today, with their towering trees dotted with multi-coloured blossoms and orchids?Based on their analysis of the pollen and leaves, the researchers propose three different explanations.Firstly, dinosaurs could have kept the forest from growing too dense by feeding on and trampling plants growing in the lower levels of the forest.A second explanation is that falling ash from the impact enriched soils throughout the tropics, giving an advantage to faster-growing flowering plants.The third explanation is that the preferential extinction of conifer species created an opportunity for flowering plants to take over.These ideas, say the team, aren't mutually exclusive, and could all have contributed to the outcome we see today.\\\"The lesson learned here is that under rapid disturbances... tropical ecosystems do not just bounce back; they are replaced, and the process takes a really long time,\\\" said Dr Carvalho."},{"author":"By Paul Rincon","title":"Long spaceflights and endurance swimming can 'shrink the heart' - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-56559494","content":"Spending very long periods of time in space has something in common with extreme endurance swimming: both can cause the heart to shrink.That's the conclusion of a study that compared the effects of astronaut Scott Kelly's year in space with a marathon swim by athlete Benoît Lecomte.Both remove the loads on the heart that are usually applied by gravity, causing the organ to atrophy.Exercise wasn't enough in either case to counteract the changes to the heart.The study was led by Dr Benjamin Levine, professor of internal medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, and is published in the journal Circulation.The research has implications for very long-duration journeys in space - such as the expeditions to Mars which Nasa plans to mount in coming decades.\\\"One of the things we've learned over many years of study, is that the heart is remarkably plastic. So the heart adapts to the load that's placed on it,\\\" Professor Levine, who is also director of the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, a collaboration between UT Southwestern and Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, told BBC News.\\\"In spaceflight, one of the things that happens, is you no longer have to pump blood uphill, because you're not pumping against gravity.\\\"Scott Kelly spent 340 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to allow scientists to study the effects of long-duration flights on the human body.On 5 June 2018, Benoît Lecomte embarked on an effort to swim the Pacific Ocean, having previously traversed the Atlantic.He swam 2,821km over 159 days, eventually abandoning the attempt.Swimming for very long periods also changes the loads placed on the heart by gravity because the person is in a horizontal position rather than vertical.Lecomte swam an average of 5.8 hours per day, sleeping for around eight hours each night. This meant that he was spending between nine and 17 hours each day in a prone state.Scientists sometimes use bed rest studies to simulate spaceflight because lying down eliminates the head-to-foot gradient that places a load on the heart. But Prof Levine said water immersion for long periods in a horizontal position is an even better model for time spent in orbit.\\\"Now you take away the head-to-foot gradient and then you put the person in the water, so you adjust that gradient too. It's just about like being in space,\\\" said Prof Levine.Because both men were no longer pumping blood uphill, as Prof Levine puts it, their hearts began to lose mass.\\\"When we look at the left ventricle [of the heart] we see about a 20-25% loss in total mass over the four or five months that Mr Lecomte was swimming,\\\" said co-author Dr James MacNamara, also from the UT Southwestern Medical Center.\\\"We saw specifically 19% and 27% of mass lost for Captain Kelly over the year.\\\"Exercise, however, counteracts the process of mass loss. Astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) are already subjected to an intense exercise regime to mitigate the muscle and bone wastage that also occurs in orbit.Even so, this exercise regime wasn't enough to prevent the heart atrophy seen in Captain Kelly.At the start of the study, researchers had wondered whether the amount of physical exercise Mr Lecomte was doing in the water might be enough to prevent the heart tissue wasting.\\\"I absolutely thought that Ben's heart would not atrophy. That's one of the nice things about science - you learn the most when you find things you didn't expect,\\\" said Prof Levine.\\\"It turns out when you swim for that many hours a day, it's not like Michael Phelps, he's not swimming as hard as he can.\\\"Instead, Mr Lecomte kicked his legs relatively lightly throughout. \\\"It's just not that much activity. Low levels of physical activity do not protect the heart from adapting to the absence of gravity,\\\" said Prof Levine.The heart adaptations, however, aren't long-term - both men's hearts returned to normal once they were back on terra firma.But chambers in the heart known as the atria expand in space, in part because of changes in the way fluid passes through. This might lead to a condition called atrial fibrillation, where the heart beats fast and in an irregular manner. It can impair exercise, but may also increase the risk of stroke.There's also another risk to this vital organ from space travel. The higher radiation levels in space might accelerate coronary heart disease. Astronauts are screened for atherosclerosis, but they are generally middle-aged when they go into space and scientists know this is a problem that builds with age.This is important because suffering a heart attack in space could be catastrophic.Prof Levine is part of a Nasa programme called Cipher that will send another 10 astronauts into space for long-duration missions. The researchers will subject the crew members' hearts to a number of different tests and high-tech scanning methods for a more detailed picture of heart function in space.Follow Paul on Twitter."},{"author":"By Bernd Debusmann Jr","title":"The 'Iron Man' body armour many of us may soon be wearing - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56660644","content":"Imagine wearing high-tech body armour that makes you super strong and tireless.Such technology, more specifically called an exoskeleton, sounds like the preserve of the Iron Man series of superhero movies.Yet the equipment is increasingly being worn in real life around the world. And one manufacturer - California's SuitX - expects it to go mainstream.\\\"There is no doubt in my mind that these devices will eventually be sold at hardware stores,\\\" says SuitX's founder Homayoon Kazerooni. \\\"As the prices come down you'll be able to simply buy them at Home Depot.\\\"In simple terms, an exoskeleton is an external device that supports, covers and protects its user, giving greater levels of strength and endurance.Sometimes also referred to as \\\"wearable robots\\\", they can be battery-powered and computer-operated, incorporating motors and hydraulics. Or they can be more simple, passive designs that use springs and dampeners.\\\"Integrating humans and machines into one system opens up a new realm of opportunity,\\\" says Adrian Spragg, an expert on the technology at management consultancy Accenture. \\\"Many of the early applications have been focused on military and medical applications, but in the last several years there's been an explosion of use in a range of cases.\\\"This expansion, which has come together with rapid advances in the technology, has seen exoskeletons increasingly used by manufacturing workers. Versions for consumers are also now being developed to help people more easily do everything from DIY, to walking, climbing stairs, and other daily activities.One report says sales are now due to rocket as a result. Global exoskeleton revenues are expected to rise from $392m (£284m) in 2020 to $6.8bn in 2030, according to a study by ABI Research.New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.SuitX's \\\"suits\\\" are now being tested by car manufacturers General Motors and Fiat. Prof Kazerooni, who is also the director of the University of California's Berkeley Robotics and Human Engineering Laboratory, says that the primary benefit of the firm's exoskeletons is to prevent muscle fatigue.\\\"We've shown that muscle activity in the back, shoulder and knees drops by 50%,\\\" he says. \\\"If muscle activities drop, that means the risk of muscle injury is less.\\\"This means that factory or plant managers get more productivity, their insurance costs are lower, and there are less workdays lost to injury. There's less cost and more productivity.\\\"General Motors is also looking at a battery-powered exoskeleton glove developed by Swedish firm Bioservo.This glove, called the Iron Hand, has sensors and motors in each finger, which automatically respond to the level of force that the wearer applies to his or her hand when lifting or gripping something. The glove therefore takes up some of the strain.BioServo says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20% for extended periods.Jason Cottrell, the chief executive of MyPlanet, a Canadian software firm that has conducted surveys on the use of exoskeletons, says the world is only just beginning to understand the potential for exoskeleton technology.\\\"The implications are, in a word, enormous,\\\" he says. \\\"Labour-intensive industries like manufacturing and agriculture have always depended on a workforce that must endure a certain level of physical exhaustion and risk.\\\"Devices that support a person's frame while doing their job will fundamentally change how the industries run.\\\"As an example of other possible applications, Mr Cottrell points to Delta Airlines, which announced last year that it was testing a full-body exoskeleton made by Utah-based Sarcos Robotics. The powered suit, which is being tried out by Delta freight-handling, maintenance and ground support staff, can lift weights of up to 14st (90kg) for eight hours at a time.\\\"And what about a server in a restaurant?\\\" adds Mr Cottrell. \\\"How could they benefit from a device that helps support the arm that carries the tray?\\\"The most advanced exoskeletons use artificial intelligence (AI) computer systems - software that can to a certain extent learn and adapt by itself. Prof Sandra Wachter, a senior research fellow in AI at Oxford University, says that such body suits are to be welcomed, but with some caution too.\\\"In general I see this development as very positive for occupational health and safety,\\\" she says. \\\"Machines are supposed to help us with dull, dangerous and dirty jobs.\\\"Robotics that protect your shoulders, your back and head, for example when you're picking up or moving things, is crucial. This is exactly one of the exciting benefits of robotics.\\\"Problems, however, arise if robotics also double as workplace surveillance.

This is the moment that I have been waiting for and I'm not getting a lot of sleep because I'm too excited.\\\"The experiment, based at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois, searches for signs of new phenomena in physics by studying the behaviour of sub-atomic particles called muons.There are building blocks of our world that are even smaller than the atom. Some of these sub-atomic particles are made up of even smaller constituents, while others can't be broken down into anything else (fundamental particles).The muon is one of these fundamental particles; it's similar to the electron, but more than 200 times heavier.The Muon g-2 experiment involves sending the particles around a 14-metre ring and then applying a magnetic field. Under the current laws of physics, encoded in the Standard Model, this should make the muons wobble at a certain rate.Instead, the scientists found that muons wobbled at a faster rate than expected. This might be caused by a force of nature that's completely new to science.No one yet knows what this potential new force does, other than influence muon particles.Theoretical physicists believe that it might also be associated with an as-yet undiscovered sub-atomic particle. There is more than one concept for what this hypothetical particle might be. One is called a leptoquark, another is the Z' boson (Z-prime boson).Last month, physicists working at the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider described results that could point to a new particle and force.Dr Mitesh Patel, from Imperial College London, who was involved with that project, said: \\\"The race is really on now to try and get one of these experiments to really get the proof that this really is something new. That will take more data and more measurements and hopefully show evidence that these effects are real.\\\"Prof Allanach has given the possible fifth force various names in his theoretical models. Among them are the \\\"flavour force\\\", the \\\"third family hyperforce\\\" and - most prosaic of all - \\\"B minus L2\\\".In addition to the more familiar forces of gravity and electromagnetism (which is responsible for electricity and magnetism), the strong and weak forces govern the behaviour of sub-atomic particles.A fifth fundamental force might help explain some of the big puzzles about the Universe that have exercised scientists in recent decades.For example, the observation that the expansion of the Universe was speeding up was attributed to a mysterious phenomenon known as dark energy. But some researchers have previously suggested it could be evidence of a fifth force.Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, co-presenter of the BBC's Sky at Night programme, told BBC News: \\\"It is quite mind boggling. It has the potential to turn physics on its head. We have a number of mysteries that remain unsolved. And this could give us the key answers to solve these mysteries.\\\"Follow Pallab on Twitter."},{"author":"By Smitha Mundasad","title":"Rare blood clots - what you need to know - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/health-56674796","content":"Investigations are taking place into whether cases of a rare type of blood clot are connected to both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Johnson and Johnson (J&J) coronavirus vaccines.The link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and these rare clots - known as CVSTs - is not yet proven, but UK experts say evidence is \\\"firming up\\\".The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises how vaccines should be used, is recommending healthy people under 30 be offered a different vaccine.The Johnson and Johnson jab is not yet available in the UK - although 30 million doses are on pre-order.However, the rollout in the US, South Africa and European Union is temporarily on hold.CVST stands for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Put simply, this is a clot found in a large vein in the brain.Blood normally travels through veins from the brain back to the heart.The CVST clot can block the flow of blood in the brain, reducing oxygen supply and potentially causing damage - stopping the central nervous system from working properly.Rare clots have also been found in other areas, such as the large veins in the abdomen, in people who have had the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, and, in a handful of cases, in some arteries (blood vessels carrying blood from the heart to organs).No-one is yet sure, but there are certain factors in common.In the CVST cases under investigation, the patients were all found to have low numbers of platelets - these are blood cells that normally help repair bleeding in the body.Patients were also found to have a particular antibody (an immune protein that often helps fight against infection) in their blood that activates platelets.The antibody causes the platelets to mistakenly clump together and form clots, and in turn activates other parts of the body's clotting system.A combination of clots and low platelets is one of the features doctors are now looking out for.Scientists think the immune system is essentially misfiring in this situation but there is a lot more that needs to be understood.Anyone who has any of the following symptoms four days or more after having the vaccine should seek prompt medical help:Most cases have been seen between four days and a few weeks of people having the jab.Medical experts in the UK now suggest doctors should consider this rare condition as a diagnosis in anyone who has matching symptoms up to a month after they have had the vaccine.According to the UK medical regulator, the MHRA, 79 cases have been identified, and 19 people have died.This is out of a total of more than 20 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine which have been given in the UK.Data continues to be analysed and there is likely to be more information as time goes on.From the current information the general risk of these types of clots following a jab is estimated to be one in 250,000.Though still rare, this risk appears to increase in younger people.The JCVI has decided that - given that healthy people under 30 are at lower risk of becoming seriously ill from Covid - the balance of risks and benefits means they should be offered a different jab, if one is available.Experts are clear that for the vast majority of people the benefits of the vaccine vastly outweighs the risks.Meanwhile a study looking at patients in the United States suggests 39 people in every million who catch a coronavirus infection go on to have a CVST within two weeks of a Covid diagnosis.The study suggests though clots are still rare in coronavirus patients, catching the infection puts people at a higher risk of getting a CVST than those who have a jab.Generally, the quicker that cases are identified, the better for the patient.Treatment can involve a number of medicines and includes immunoglobulins - immune proteins - given through a drip.Some patients will be sent home with new generation blood thinners and have regular monitoring.According to blood specialist, Prof Adrian Newland, current evidence suggests 75% of people survive.An expert panel of blood specialists in the UK have put together guidance for doctors, which is being constantly updated.The Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines work in very similar ways.Six cases of the rare clots - cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) - have been detected in more than 6.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said.The FDA said it was recommending the temporary pause \\\"out of an abundance of caution\\\".It confirmed that one patient died from blood clotting complications, and another is in a critical condition. All six cases were in women aged between 18 and 48, with symptoms appearing six to 13 days after vaccination.Johnson & Johnson issued a statement saying that it shared \\\"all adverse event reports\\\" with health authorities."},{"author":"By Rebecca Morelle","title":"USS Johnston: Sub dives to deepest-known shipwreck - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-56608713","content":"A submersible has dived to the world\\u2019s deepest-known shipwreck.The vessel reached the USS Johnston, which lies 6.5km (4 miles) beneath the waves in the Philippine Sea in the Pacific Ocean.Explorers spent several hours surveying and filming the wreck over a series of dives.The 115m-long US Navy destroyer sank during the Battle off Samar in 1944 after a fierce battle with a large fleet of Japanese warships.Victor Vescovo, who led the expedition and piloted the sub, said: \\u201CThe wreck is so deep so there's very little oxygen down there, and while there is a little bit of contamination from marine life, it's remarkably well intact except for the damage it took from the furious fight.\\u201DThe remains of the USS Johnston were first discovered in 2019, and parts of the destroyer were filmed with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV).But a large part of the wreckage lay deeper than the ROV was able to reach, so for this expedition a submersible called the DSV Limiting Factor was deployed.The vessel has a 9cm-thick (3.5in) titanium pressure hull that two people can fit inside, and it is able to descend to any depth.

Aviation is likely to become more expensive for frequent fliers.Environmentalists welcomed the government's move, but warned that ministers had consistently failed to achieve previous CCC-set targets from the CCC.And they insisted that Chancellor Rishi Sunak must show clearly how the transition is to be funded.'Not on track'\\\"This is fantastic - very big news,\\\" Leo Murray of the climate charity Possible told BBC News.\\\"The decision to include international aviation and shipping is a huge milestone, unprecedented, and shows clear global leadership,\\\" he added.\\\"But one thing you can't fault the government for is agreeing to targets on climate change. We're not on track to meet previous climate commitments and in many ways the government is still failing.\\\"Mr Murray said ministers were \\\"facing both directions at the same time\\\", as they had scrapped the Green Homes Grant for insulating homes, had not stopped airport expansion and were \\\"still pushing a £27bn roads budget\\\".The CCC report accepted by the government says low-carbon investment must scale up to £50bn a year in the UK. But it adds that in time fuel savings from more efficient equipment will cancel out investment costs.The CCC believes around 1% of GDP - national wealth - would need to be spent on shifting away from fossil fuels over 30 years.Its chairman, Lord Deben, said previously: \\\"The implication of this path is clear: the utmost focus is required from government over the next 10 years.\\\"If policy is not scaled up across every sector, if business is not encouraged to invest, if the people of the UK are not engaged in this challenge - the UK will not deliver Net Zero by 2050. The 2020s must be the decisive decade of progress and action.\\\"Net Zero means cutting emissions as far as possible, then capturing any emissions that cannot be prevented through tree-planting or engineering.The government has adopted the new 2035 date for a 78% emissions cut because scientists said the previous target of an 80% cut by 2050 was not strict enough to achieve the aim of keeping global temperature rise close to 1.5C.Last month Labour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, called for a \\\"green transformation\\\" of the UK, urging the government not to \\\"put a green coat of paint on our unequal, insecure economy\\\".North SeaA specific policy proposal for carbon cuts will be offered by 100 Nobel Laureates to the participants at President Biden's climate summit.It urges a carbon non-proliferation treaty similar to the nuclear arms treaty to prevent increasing use of coal, oil and gas by ending all new exploration and production.This runs counter to the UK's plan to continue drilling to find gas and oil in the North Sea - to help the country's balance of payments and to support jobs in the sector.It gives an indication of the scale of the task ahead to transform the economy.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Greta Thunberg: Meeting David Attenborough was 'indescribable' - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/newsbeat-56802655","content":"Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg says meeting with fellow campaigner Sir David Attenborough was \\\"indescribable.\\\"He features in the 18-year-old's new BBC documentary on climate change, A Year to Change the World.Speaking to Greg James on the Radio 1 Breakfast show, Greta said Sir David was the kind of person everyone looked up to.\\\"Whatever he says you agree with it basically.

We're losing the good guys.\\\"The Oregon Music Hall of Fame also saluted the guitarist on Facebook, noting, \\\"He never let his chops fall behind. His playing just got better as he aged.\\\"The Kingsmen never truly capitalised on the success of their runaway hit, falling victim to in-band fighting. In fact, Ely and bassist Bob Nordby had actually quit before Louie Louie was released.However, Mitchell continued to record with a new line-up, scoring some minor US hits in the 1960s, including a cover of Money (That's What I Want) and the novelty song Jolly Green Giant.The band quietly came to an end in 1968, but reformed in the late 70s after the movie Animal House re-introduced Louie Louie to a new generation; and they continued to tour into the 2010s.In the meantime, Louie Louie has been covered more than 1,000 times - second only to The Beatles' Yesterday. Sadly, the original writer, Richard Berry, initially failed to capitalise on the success, having sold the publishing rights in 1957 to pay for his wedding.He eventually regained some control of the music in 1986, and sold his share for a substantial sum in 1992.The Kingsmen's recording was honoured by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Grammy Hall of Fame, while Rolling Stone magazine placed it 55th in its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.Reflecting on his career in a 1999 radio interview, Mitchell said he wasn't bothered that The Kingsmen were defined by the song.\\\"We're just happy to have any success, that we can still do this,\\\" he said. \\\"It's actually a wonderful career that we've had.\\\"The musician is survived by his children Samantha and Max.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

She was funny, clever, insightful, and honest.Two years after she died in 2012, a book was published containing much of her best work. The Most of Nora Ephron is a testament to her genius, from the script for When Harry Met Sally, to her 1973 essay on Dorothy Parker.Nobody gets an easy ride with Nora Ephron, including Nora Ephron.She wrote a piece in 2003 about getting old, a rich subject for a witty writer. It was called I Feel Bad About My Neck, and describes - in a masterclass of non-fiction prose - the undisguisable tell-tale signs of ageing as seen around the neck, which she identifies as starting at 43 years old.I only mention this because it reminded me of a Frances McDormand quote in the New York Times a while back, when she was talking about playing the eponymous Olive Kitteridge in the 2014 television mini-series.The role required the then 57-year-old McDormand and her screen husband, Richard Jenkins, to play characters who age from their early 40s to their mid-70s. Jenkins used tape under his chin to tighten up his skin above the collar line. McDormand chose not to. Until, that is, the director (Lisa Cholodenko) sat her down for a chat after a camera test and asked if the actress had read Nora Ephron's essay about her neck.\\\"Yes\\\", said McDormand. \\\"Give me the tape.\\\"Nora liked to compile lists, such as \\\"What I Will Miss\\\", and \\\"'What I Won't Miss\\\".A 2006 list titled, \\\"What I Wish I'd Known\\\", begins with: People have only one way of being. As ever, Ephron was being perceptive, smart, and correct with an observation that applies even when it comes to actors of the calibre of Ms McDormand.On the one hand, she has great range - taking on characters that vary wildly.But on the other, she always imbues them with an unmistakable Frances McDormandness.Take, for example, the two movies for which she has won an Oscar (Fargo, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), and the movie she is probably about to win another Oscar (Nomadland).The three women she plays in these three films, which span a quarter of a century, could be sisters. Marge (Fargo), Mildred (Three Billboards) and Fern (Nomadland) share an inherent kindness and quirkiness. They are all at-once semi-detached and warmly empathetic.Fern is the most circumspect of the trio.We meet her shortly after her settled life in Empire, Nevada was devastated by the death of her husband, a blow to the 61-year-old Fern, that is quickly followed by the economic collapse of the entire town due to the closure of a factory around which it had grown. Empire been \\\"discontinued\\\", its zip code erased along with Fern's sense of place.She is discombobulated but resolute.Fern might not have a home but, she figures, that doesn't mean she is homeless.Not while she's still got Vanguard, her trusty Ford Econoline van, which she has turned into a modest but adequate RV. She rolls out of town and doesn't stop rolling. She doesn't know exactly where she's going, but there's one thing for sure, she ain't coming back.And so, a new life starts for this mild-mannered, middle-aged woman.It's a life on the open road for Fern, travelling through America's epic landscape, picking up seasonal jobs here and there, and meeting fellow nomads who, like her, have experienced a rude awaking from their American Dream.They are largely from the Boomer generation, folk her age and a bit older, who were knocked sideways by the 2008 financial crash, when the future they had worked so hard for proved to be a mirage in the desert of capitalism.You might expect to see a mixture of fury, resentment, sadness, and defeat. But no, instead there is a prevailing sense of peace, serenity and belonging.As Fern travels from place-to-place and meets more and more people roaming the American West, she realises she has stumbled upon a previously unknown community to whom she can relate.A group of people like her, people who have shed the concrete skin of modern life to be at one with nature.People who have found a connection between each other established over a mug of coffee on a dusty verge, rather than through cyberspace on social media. A puncture repair kit is about as high-tech as their life gets.We find out more about Fern as she picks through the few items she's chosen to take with her. There's an old photo with her husband when they were young, a plate or two with a nice pattern, and some craft materials. She's a friendly soul but wants to be left alone to mull things over, to work something out; to find a new meaning to her life.There is a thoughtfulness, a seriousness even, that runs through the film.It is a contemplative movie, which, like Fern's van, moves slowly. Several of the nomads she encounters along the way are the real deal, bone fide members of the contemporary nomadic community with whom McDormand and director-writer Chloé Zhao collaborated.That the Oscar-winning film star is able to appear completely in tune with their lives and psyche is a reflection not only on her skills as an actor, but also, a reflection of her own nature.Zhao and McDormand don't give Fern a completely free ride. There is the complication of a potential love interest in the shape of gentle Dave (David Strathairn), who takes a shine to our lady in the van. Fern has a decision to make about him, and another about whether or not to pursue her peripatetic lifestyle.Temptation is put in her way.A warm bed and a hot bath have their attractions. But then, so does floating naked in a lake in high summer without a care in the world.The movie has received criticism for the positive way it depicts Fern's stint working in an Amazon distribution centre. I have to say, it did strike me as a little too good to be true, and jarred somewhat in a film that is implicitly critical about the impact big business has on people's lives and the natural world.Beyond that, Zhao's directing is superb.The shots of the \\\"American Sublime\\\" are gorgeous, while her close-quarters work among the nomads' camps and RVs touches on cinema vérité, which, of course, much of it is.Not only are the non-actors an integral part of the film's documentary aesthetic, but so is its source material, a 2017 book called Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century. It was written by Jessica Bruder, who spent months embedded gonzo-style with the country's nomadic communities.The film deserves the plaudits and awards it's receiving, although I'd give the equally philosophical Minari the Best Picture Oscar.McDormand is terrific throughout.It is unusual for stories like Nomadland to receive the sort of coverage the film has garnered. The actress has used her talents and celebrity to shine a light on an area of life, and the people who inhabit it, which few knew about or appreciated.

I mean, there's really no substitute for that. But one of the things that kept me going through the lockdown [has been] being able to play music and set up little studios, wherever.\\\"I was very lucky that I had a couple of places and... a nice garden,\\\" said the veteran '60s rocker.As a self-professed \\\"townie\\\", Jagger said he has \\\"never spent so much time in the country\\\" as he has since Covid struck. After 50 years of the touring lifestyle, he admitted that the enforced break has been \\\"really difficult\\\" at times.Looking beyond the challenge of getting on with people and \\\"perhaps spending longer with them than you normally would\\\", he counts himself as incredibly fortunate.\\\"You have to be patient, learn self-reliance... but all these things, as I say for me... I'm very lucky. I don't have the problems of living, say in a small flat in London or New York, which some of my friends have had,\\\" he told the radio host.\\\"Two kids in a two room flat in Manhattan? I honestly don't know how I would have done that. Maybe a couple of weeks. But for that long, I don't know how I would have done it. And I admire them for being able to do it.\\\"He's also keenly aware of the impact on mental health throughout society.\\\"I can feel that people could get really quite depressed about the whole thing because there was a point where there was no light at the end of the tunnel. It was sometimes a little bit down for a lot of people, but I was lucky enough to avoid most of that\\\".Lockdown single to help find lightJagger, now 77 and a father of eight, said he believed his adaptability has helped him \\\"roll with the punches\\\" through the uncertainty. And that optimism has extended to his music, including a surprise - remote - lockdown collaboration with Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl.Their track, Eazy Sleazy, attempts to provide a \\\"sardonic and humorous\\\" take on coming out of lockdown, at least in the UK, as Jagger reflects on a year of \\\"crazy\\\" Covid lifestyle changes, big and small - including the fight against misinformation.\\\"Shooting the vaccine\\\/Bill Gates is in my bloodstream\\\/It's mind control,\\\" he sings on a verse which he openly admits is about poking fun at conspiracy theorists.Elsewhere he reflects on a world of \\\"zoom calls\\\", \\\"home in these prison walls\\\", fake applause and too much TV. With optimism and change in sight he looks forward to normality and the \\\"garden of earthly delights\\\".The song was produced by Jagger's long-time musical collaborator Matt Clifford, who also moulded Jagger's two solo 2017 efforts, Gotta Get a Grip and England Lost.Musically, it sees Jagger share guitar duties with Grohl, who also plays the bass and the drums - reprising his role with Nirvana.Jagger told Everitt the pair have crossed paths quite a few times and \\\"kept in touch\\\" after meeting during Saturday Night Live shows, performing Stones shows together and impromptu jams.\\\"I like his style, he's a great musician\\\", said Jagger, \\\"rocky... with lots of energy\\\".This kinship meant that creating the single, even oceans apart, was a \\\"fun... really easy\\\" process, partly thanks to Grohl's home studio in Los Angeles.Grohl's commitment was immediate as soon as he heard the song. \\\"He said 'going in tomorrow. Love it,'\\\" remembered Jagger. \\\"So he just did that straightaway.\\\"Despite not being in the same room together, Jagger added Grohl's \\\"definite personality comes through\\\" in his drumming style, much like the Stones' stoic, assured Charlie Watts.Touring plansOn the topic of his original band, Jagger says he is looking forward to reuniting with his old bandmates, and particularly returning to the stage, even if \\\"it's a big guess\\\" when that might happen.Still, he says the Stones will \\\"definitely\\\" continue and remain committed to completing their American tour that was postponed by Covid. \\\"Hopefully things will somewhere near normal by the end of the summer, let's hope, anyway,\\\" Jagger said.His checklist until then? Typically tireless.\\\"Improve guitar playing. Practice mouth organ. Do more dancing. Get ready for tour,\\\" he said, only partially tongue-in-cheek.\\\"You know, I gotta get in shape because the tour could be sooner than I think. So I've got to be ready for that. And keep the songs coming.\\\"In other words, he just keeps on rolling.Hear Matt Everitt's full BBC 6 Music interview with Sir Mick Jagger by listening back on BBC Sounds.Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

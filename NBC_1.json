Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, declined to take the stand last week, bringing the defense close to an end in the high-profile trial.The jury will begin deliberations after prosecutors and Chauvin's lawyers present their closing arguments and the judge provides instructions on the charges, which include second-degree murder.Daniella SilvaDerek Chauvin\\u2019s defense tried Monday to use the testimony of the medical examiner who performed George Floyd\\u2019s autopsy and determined his cause of death against the prosecution. Attorney Eric Nelson pointed out during closing arguments that Dr. Andrew Baker initially avoided watching the bystander video because he didn\\u2019t want it to influence his autopsy. Baker, who has been the chief medical examiner in Hennepin County since 2004, did subsequently watch the video before determining Floyd\\u2019s cause of death. During cross-examination, Dr. Baker acknowledged to the defense that he saw no physical signs of asphyxiation, which contradicted other prosecution expert witnesses who said in their assessments that Floyd died from asphyxia. Those experts also testified that bruises and other injuries do not need to be present to determine that asphyxia occurred. The medical examiner previously testified that Floyd's heart disease and drug use contributed to his death, but police officers' restraint of his body and compression of his neck were still the primary causes.\\\"Mr. Floyd\\u2019s use of fentanyl did not cause the subdual or neck restraint, his heart disease did not cause the subdual or the neck restraint,\\\" Baker said.Baker ruled Floyd\\u2019s cause of death was \\\"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\\\" The manner of death was ruled a homicide.Daniella SilvaDerek Chauvin\\u2019s defense told jurors Monday during closing arguments that the state needed to convince them beyond a reasonable doubt that multiple other factors, including George Floyd\\u2019s medical history and drug use, did not cause his death.Attorney Eric Nelson argued that the prosecution had to prove the stress of being arrested, the adrenaline caused by that stress, heart disease, hypertension, excited delirium, a paraganglioma and drugs in his system \\u2014 or any combination of those factors \\u2014 didn't lead to Floyd\\u2019s death.Nelson said testimony from prosecution medical experts on Floyd\\u2019s cause of death that excluded these possibilities, \\u201Cflies in the absolute face of reason and common sense.\\\"Multiple prosecution witnesses testified they believed Floyd died from a lack of oxygen due to Chauvin's restraint for more than nine minutes.Nelson directly targeted Dr. Martin Tobin, a renowned pulmonologist, who was arguably the prosecution's strongest medical witness. Tobin testified that Floyd died of a lack of oxygen.Nelson zeroed in on testimony from Tobin that Floyd used his knuckles to push himself up to try to breathe. Nelson said that Floyd was in a side recovery at the moment Tobin described, meaning he should have been able to breathe.\\\"His entire testimony is based on theory, speculation, assumption,\\\" Nelson said.Daniella SilvaDerek Chauvin\\u2019s defense argued Monday there was \\u201Cabsolutely no evidence that Officer Chauvin intentionally, purposefully applied unlawful force.\\\" Attorney Eric Nelson said during closing arguments the evidence showed Chauvin was following his training as a police officer during his interaction with George Floyd.\\\"These are officers doing their job in a highly stressful situation, according to their training, according to the policies of the Minneapolis Police Department,\\\" he said. \\\"And it's tragic, it's tragic.\\u201DDaniella SilvaDerek Chauvin\\u2019s defense argued Monday that concerns about the bystanders gathered around the scene of George Floyd\\u2019s fatal interaction with police distracted the former officer at the \\u201Ccritical moment\\u201D when Floyd took his last breath.\\u201CAs this crowd grew more and more upset or deeper into crisis, a very critical thing happens at a very precise moment,\\u201D attorney Eric Nelson told jurors Monday afternoon during closing arguments.He said at that moment, Floyd took his last breath. At the same time, Nelson said Chauvin pulled out his can of pepper spray in response to the crowd\\u2019s reactions and another bystander who was an off-duty firefighter approached from behind, \\u201Cstartling him.\\u201D\\u201CAll of these facts and circumstances simultaneously occur at a critical moment,\\u201D Nelson said. \\u201CAnd that changed Officer Chauvin\\u2019s perception of what was happening.\\u201DThroughout the trial, the defense has sought to portray the bystanders as a potential concern for the officers' safety and as a distraction.Danny CevallosThe defense must have felt they absolutely needed the jury to see certain things in the video because there was considerable risk in showing the prosecution\\u2019s strongest evidence.I suspect the prosecution is likely pleased by this decision, reminding jurors of George Floyd repeatedly telling police that he couldn't breathe. Daniella SilvaDerek Chauvin\\u2019s defense told jurors Monday to consider the \\u201Ctotality of circumstances and facts\\u201D known to the former officer when considering if a \\u201Creasonable officer\\u201D would have restrained George Floyd the way he did.\\u201CThe proper analysis is to take those 9 minutes and 29 seconds and put it into the context of the totality of the circumstances that a reasonable police officer would know,\\u201D attorney Eric Nelson said in discussing whether Chauvin\\u2019s use of force was justified. The argument seemed an attempt to redirect jurors from a refrain made by the prosecution to jurors during their opening statements and closing arguments, \\u201CBelieve your eyes.\\u201D The prosecution has sought to focus jurors on the more than nine minutes Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck as he lay pinned to the ground in handcuffs.The jurors have seen extensive video footage of Floyd\\u2019s fatal encounter with police from multiple angles and from different sources.Geoff Bennett and Rebecca ShabadPresident Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks after the jury in the Derek Chauvin trial renders a verdict, according to multiple administration officials.The White House is monitoring the trial\\u2019s developments and is preparing a statement for Biden, who has been gaming out with his team for the last two weeks how to react to various verdicts.The administration has also planned for possible public demonstrations in response to the verdict, including meetings with counterterrorism and homeland security advisers and Cedric Richmond, the White House director of public engagement.Read more on NBCNews.com. Daniella SilvaDerek Chauvin\\u2019s defense attorney began his closing argument Monday by reminding jurors that his client is presumed innocent of the charges he faces over the death of George Floyd and that the prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\\u201CHe\\u2019s presumed innocent of these charges and this presumption remains with him throughout the course of the trial, the presentation of the evidence, throughout the course of your deliberations, until and unless the state has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt,\\u201D Eric Nelson said Monday morning. \\u201CThe defendant doesn\\u2019t have to try to catch up,\\u201D he said.He reminded jurors that \\u201Cproof beyond a reasonable doubt,\\u201D according to the definition read earlier by the judge, was \\u201Csuch proof as ordinary, prudent men and women would act upon in their most important affairs.\\u201D Meanwhile, \\u201Creasonable doubt\\u201D was defined as \\u201Ca doubt that is based upon reason and common sense,\\u201D Nelson said.\\\"I submit to you that the state has failed to meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,\\\" he added.Chauvin took off his mask for the defense's closing argument, and looked at the jury while his attorney spoke. He has worn a mask throughout the trial and seemed to be taking notes while both sides argued their cases.Daniella SilvaProsecutor Steven Schleicher told jurors Monday that George Floyd \\u201Cbeing large and being on something is not a justification for the use of force\\u201D that Derek Chauvin used against him during his fatal interaction with police.Schleicher said Chauvin \\u201Cexplained the basis of his actions\\u201D to one of the bystanders, 61-year-old Charles Charles McMillian. In police video, Chauvin could be heard saying in footage to McMillian that Floyd was a \\\"sizable guy\\\" who was \\\"probably on something.\\\"\\u201CHis two justifications were that George Floyd was big, and that he might be \\u2018on something,'\\u201D Schleicher said Monday during his closing argument. Schleicher told the jurors they had heard the standards for use of force during testimony and that officers are authorized to use force \\u201Cto respond to a threat, they\\u2019re not authorized to use force to respond to a risk.\\u201DThe attorney said while Floyd could have been a potential \\u201Crisk,\\u201D his size and whether he had taken drugs alone did not make him a \\u201Cthreat\\u201D to Chauvin or the other officers and was not a crime.\\u201CWhen questioned, their force expert witness conceded that the combination of the two, being large and being on something is not a justification for the use of force,\\u201D he said of one of the defense witnesses. \\u201CIt just isn\\u2019t. That\\u2019s not what they get to do.\\u201DSchleicher said Chauvin\\u2019s explanation was \\u201Cnot good enough\\u201D and was not following use of force policy or procedure. \\u201CHe is not following the rules,\\u201D he added.Ben KesslenBehind the prosecution's detailed argument is a simple message to the jury: believe your own eyes.In his closing argument, prosecutor Steven Schleicher repeated the same maxim with which the prosecution began. \\u201CYou can believe your eyes,\\u201D said Schleicher, who has relied heavily on video and images of the events leading up to Floyd\\u2019s death to make his point.It is an emotional appeal to the jury and a remarkably straightforward one. It was precisely the video of Floyd\\u2019s death that sparked the global uprising last summer and brought people to the streets in protest. Schleicher, it seems, ultimately believes that same video is his best argument for conviction.\\\"This case is exactly what you thought when you saw it first, when you saw that video. It is exactly that,\\\" Schleicher said. \\\"You can believe your eyes... It's exactly what you knew. It's what you felt in your gut. It's what you now know in your heart. This wasn't policing; this was murder. The defendant is guilty of all three counts. All of them. And there is no excuse.\\\" "},{"author":"Unknown","title":"An 'enormous burden': Chauvin trial jurors will face scrutiny \u2014 no matter their verdict","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/enormous-burden-chauvin-trial-jurors-will-face-scrutiny-no-matter-n1264433","content":"Henry King Jr. was a utility worker in Southern California when he was picked as a juror in one of the nation's most notable televised trials: the case against four Los Angeles police officers accused in the beating of a Black motorist, Rodney King.King Jr., no relation to Rodney King, had seen the now-infamous camcorder footage of the traffic stop on March 3, 1991, and found himself as a key player in the courtroom drama the following year. The jury's decision nearly 30 years ago to acquit the officers \\u2014 three white and one Hispanic \\u2014 unleashed days of deadly rioting that devastated parts of Los Angeles and cleaved the city's communities along racial lines.Now, King Jr. says that while he's aware that the trial in Minneapolis of former Police Officer Derek Chauvin is winding down with closing arguments Monday, his thoughts are with the panel of 12 jurors tasked with delivering a verdict \\u2014 one that could become a catalyst for a fresh wave of protests like the ones that rocked dozens of American cities last year with the killing of George Floyd.\\\"This reminds me so much of my time and what we were going through,\\\" King Jr., 78, said.\\\"They're going to be going through a lot,\\\" he said of the jurors in Chauvin's trial. \\\"I feel for them. They're going to have a tough time, no matter which way they go.\\\"Trials against police officers accused of excessive force or homicide remain rare, and such cases have become rallying cries for substantive changes to policing, particularly in communities of color. But given the intense scrutiny in the trial of Chauvin, the white officer charged in the death of Floyd, a Black man, after he knelt on his neck, the deliberation and outcome are certain to be grueling on the jurors, King Jr. said.He added: \\\"It's going to be traumatic for them.\\\"The jury must consider whether Chauvin is guilty of any or all of the three charges against him: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He faces a maximum of 40 years in prison.During the course of the trial, the proceedings have taken a toll on some. On a day when parts of the video of Chauvin's encounter with Floyd were played multiple times, the courtroom stopped for a juror who was having a \\\"stress-related reaction\\\" and had been having trouble sleeping.Former jurors in similarly high-profile trials have described wrestling with their decisions long after the spotlight fades, suffering mental health issues, even facing death threats from strangers who disagreed with the result.King Jr. said it got so bad that he left his home and retreated to a cabin about 200 miles outside of Los Angeles, where he was able to \\\"let things settle down.\\\"The ensuing days of unrest, in which more than 50 people were killed across Los Angeles, weighed heavily on King Jr. as he thought perhaps a different verdict would have averted the violence. But he's come to peace with his decision, he said.\\\"I'm OK because I still wouldn't have changed my verdict because of what people thought,\\\" he added. \\\"Even my own family, though, my own mother thought, 'Why did you vote that way?'\\\"The racial makeup of the jury at the time also garnered headlines because none of the 12 jurors were identified as Black, though one was of Hispanic heritage and another was Asian American. But in 2012, King Jr. revealed in a Scripps Newspapers interview that he is of mixed race: his father is part Black and his mother is white.While he said he's unashamed of his background and identifies now as being part Black, his racial identity was not something that he regularly talked about growing up and people assumed during the trial he was only white because of his appearance. He became public about his racial identity, he said, because he wants people to know his decision to find the officers not guilty wasn't tied to racist ideologies but the result of the evidence presented at trial.A jury's racial makeup, particularly in police-related trials, has become increasingly scrutinized in recent years as criminal justice reform advocates and scholars argue that a lack of jury diversity can play a role in whether a trial is fair and impartial.A University of California, Berkeley, study in 2020 found that prosecutors in hundreds of California appellate court trials examined from 2006 to 2018 used peremptory challenges to strike Black jurors from nearly 75 percent of cases and Latino jurors from about 28 percent of cases, while white jurors were removed from only 0.4 percent of cases.In Chauvin's trial, among the 12 jurors and two alternates, there are six white women and two white men; three Black men and one Black woman; and two mixed-race women.The racial diversity of the jury is especially notable because Hennepin County, where the trial is being held, has only a 14 percent Black population, according to census data.In addition, jurors in their questionnaires expressed their views about the racial justice reckoning that engulfed American discourse over the past year and their attitudes surrounding race and policing \\u2014 with some feeling favorably about either the concept of the Black Lives Matter or the Blue Lives Matter movements.Such feelings didn't prompt their immediate dismissal as potential jurors, marking a \\\"subtle sea change\\\" in how racial biases are treated in the courtroom, said Sonali Chakravarti, an associate professor of government at Wesleyan University who has written about how the Black Lives Matter movement has shaped the Chauvin trial.\\\"We're seeing a really clear improvement over past trials related to police violence,\\\" she said. \\\"That's important because I can't think of a case that's got more scrutiny since Rodney King or the Central Park jogger case.\\\"She added that there is an \\\"enormous burden\\\" on this jury to come to a conclusion that might appease those already distrustful of the criminal justice system while balancing their own consciences that justice is being served.Charlene Cooke, a jury member in the 2018 trial of former Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke, was among a handful of jurors who later spoke to the media to express how she arrived at the verdict. Van Dyke, who is white, was found guilty of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery in the shooting death of Laquan McDonald, a Black teenager, in a case that set off demonstrations in Chicago and demands for police reform.Cooke, 62, was the lone Black juror in Van Dyke's trial, and said she was especially determined to show she was carefully analyzing the evidence \\u2014 and that her verdict wasn't clouded by biases or that it had to automatically satisfy the Black community's expectations.Her advice to jurors in the Chauvin trial: \\\"Whatever choice you make, regardless of who thinks it's right or wrong, if you know your choice is right, just stand by it.\\\"After Van Dyke's trial concluded, Cooke returned to her job as a FedEx driver, but instead of slipping into obscurity, she was often recognized on her route. One woman surprised Cooke by coming up behind her in a store to hug her; others confronted her, lashing out, \\\"How dare you?\\\"Cooke said she had to overcome the feelings of \\\"why me\\\" for such a critical trial and the trauma associated with repeatedly watching McDonald lose his life on the police dashcam video. But she found support in those who knew her.To the jurors in the Chauvin trial, she said, \\\"if you're feeling overwhelmed, don't allow yourself to sit back and wallow in it.\\\"King Jr. said it's important to recognize that the jurors in the Chauvin trial may continue to grapple with trauma resulting from hearing emotional testimony and watching the video of Floyd struggling in his final moments.After the trial in the Rodney King beating ended, he said, he and the others jurors would meet as a group to support one another and talk about their experiences. Some spoke of mental health issues. Many, like King Jr., tried to put the events behind them.\\\"To anybody who thinks they know what these current jurors are going through, don't prejudge the case and think you know how easy it is,\\\" he said. \\\"Just try to understand that while they're fulfilling their civic duty, they are sacrificing a lot \\u2014 and they never asked for any of this.\\\"Erik Ortiz is a staff writer for NBC News focusing on racial injustice and social inequality."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Chauvin trial: Biden to deliver remarks after verdict","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/politics\/white-house\/biden-deliver-remarks-after-derek-chauvin-trial-verdict-n1264513","content":"WASHINGTON \\u2014 President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks after the jury in the Derek Chauvin trial renders a verdict, according to multiple administration officials.The White House is monitoring the trial\\u2019s developments and is preparing a statement for Biden, who has been gaming out with his team for the last two weeks how to react to various verdicts.The administration has also planned for possible public demonstrations in response to the verdict, including meetings with counterterrorism and Homeland Security advisers and Cedric Richmond, the White House director of public engagement.The trial entered its final stage Monday as prosecutors and the defense team delivered closing arguments.

The justices have consistently declined to take up any of the post-election challenges from the state.Pennsylvania officials urged the court not to touch the case, declaring it \\\"as moot as moot can be,\\\" given that the election is long since over and that the total number of ballots at issue was less than the margin of victory in each of the state's federal races.In other words, even if the challengers had prevailed in their legal challenge, it would not have affected the outcome.The case rejected Monday involved a lawsuit filed by Jim Bognet, an unsuccessful candidate for Congress, and four Republican voters. They challenged the secretary of state's decision to allow three extra days for receiving mail ballots \\u2014 from Tuesday evening to Friday evening \\u2014 given the statements from the U.S. Postal Service that delivery would likely be slow.The Republicans said only the legislature could authorize such a change, but their claim was rejected by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to rule otherwise.Republicans brought similar challenges to voting changes in other states, all based on the claim that only legislatures can make substantive changes in voting procedures.The Supreme Court has never ruled on whether that is, in fact, how the law works.

The deal was designed to appease their wishes for more games, seemingly because they couldn't control the sale of rights to the existing competition.The Super League plan was first leaked in January, but re-emerged this weekend.Real Madrid president Florentino Perez would be the founding chairman of the Super League, which said it \\\"intended to commence as soon as practicable\\\" as a 20-team competition playing in midweek like the current Champions League and Europa League.The competition would begin with two groups of 10 teams, with the top three from each group advancing to the quarterfinals. The teams finishing fourth and fifth would be involved in a playoff to complete the last-eight lineup. The knockout phase would still feature two-legged quarterfinals and semifinals before a single fixture final.\\u201CWe will help football at every level and take it to its rightful place in the world,\\u201D Perez said in a statement. \\u201CFootball is the only global sport in the world with more than four billion fans and our responsibility as big clubs is to respond to their desires.\\u201DNo evidence was presented that supporters want a Super League.Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics\\u201CBy bringing together the world\\u2019s greatest clubs and players to play each other throughout the season, the Super League will open a new chapter for European football, ensuring world-class competition and facilities, and increased financial support for the wider football pyramid,\\u201D said Joel Glazer, co-owner of Manchester United and SL vice chairman.Only 12 clubs have signed up for now \\u2014 with none from France or Germany \\u2014 but the Super League hopes for three more as permanent members.

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., appeared in front of the clubhouse at Trump National Doral in Miami and defended himself in the wake of news that the Justice Department was investigating whether he violated sex trafficking laws. (Gaetz denies any and all allegations.)About 75 miles north, and at around the same time, former White House press secretary and current GOP candidate for governor of Arkansas Sarah Huckabee Sanders stood before a fountain decorated with giant swans at Mar-a-Lago, addressing a private gathering of donors. It was her second recent fundraising trip to Donald Trump's resort-cum-home (and yes, the former president spoke to her supporters\\\/his customers at both events).https:\\\/\\\/www.instagram.com\\\/p\\\/CNfHaTuDdGIRather than outliers, though, these events are indicative of one of 2021's hottest travel trends for Republican politicians: a visit to a Trump property. But the GOP's fealty to the former president doesn't just inflate his ego, of course. It also pads his bottom line.The day before Sanders' fundraiser, the Conservative Partnership Institute held a dinner at Mar-a-Lago that reportedly featured several former top officials of the Trump White House; the day after Sanders' fundraiser, the Republican National Committee booked Mar-a-Lago's ballroom for a 400-person banquet.After Trump's election loss \\u2014 followed by the months of bogus claims of voter fraud that incited an insurrection \\u2014 it wasn't clear what influence, if any, he would retain over the political party he commandeered five years ago. But with Republican politicians following migratory birds south to Florida, it's clear that the 45th president remains the GOP's kingmaker.In the late afternoon of Jan. 6, it seemed likely that the GOP was going to escape Trump's grip. But three weeks after the riots at the Capitol left five people dead and a nation in shock, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., broke the seal on re-embracing Trump with a well-publicized conciliatory pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago.Since then, GOP officials have been popping up at Trump's Florida properties like they're Trump's D.C. hotel, circa 2019. At least two Republican governors, four senators and 11 House members have visited Mar-a-Lago since McCarthy's social call, according to a tally I'm keeping for my 1100 Pennsylvania newsletter. Meanwhile, candidates seeking office, from Sanders to a QAnon-adjacent contender trying to primary a Republican member of Congress in Florida (no, not Gaetz!), have trekked to Mar-a-Lago in search of the Horcrux that is Trump's endorsement.I\\u2019m PROUD tonight to receive President Trump\\u2019s endorsement for my 2022 reelection. Our America First movement is the FUTURE of the Republican Party, and WE WILL WIN in 2022! #MAGA #TX13 pic.twitter.com\\\/sFF0CdoP1qThe largesse includes Trump's nearby golf courses, too. Trump Palm Beach has hosted campaign fundraisers for Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, and Max Miller, a former White House staffer running for a House seat in Ohio. (The latter event also drew four possible candidates for one of Ohio's Senate seats; Trump had them compete for his love, according to Politico's Alex Isenstadt).Meanwhile, before Gaetz's defiant defense at Doral, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and at least three House Republicans took to the stage as part of the Save America Summit. Notably, the summit was hosted by Women for America First, the group that organized the Jan. 6 rally.All of this kissing the ring costs lawmakers more than their dignity. The Washington Post reported that the Republican National Committee paid the Trump Organization more than $100,000 for the privilege of dining at Mar-a-Lago this month (yes, that'd be the meal where Trump called Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell a \\\"dumb son of a b----\\\").And reports filed last week show that Trump's U.S. ambassador to Slovenia, Lynda Blanchard, spent almost $14,000 in campaign funds in Mar-a-Lago in March while pursuing Trump's endorsement in the GOP primary for a Senate seat in Alabama (she was unsuccessful, and he endorsed Rep. Mo Brooks, instead).In addition to direct payments from campaigns and committees, the GOP is helping Trump profit by serving up eye candy for Trump's other customers. Just days after Trump golfed at his Palm Beach course with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Lindsey \\\"Count Me Out\\\" Graham, R-S.C., Rob Crilly of the Washington Examiner reported that Trump Palm Beach was planning to more than double its initiation fee.Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said that now that Trump's out of office, there's no legal conflict of interest in the GOP's support of his businesses, but the arrangement remains problematic. Last week, the left-leaning government watchdog issued a report criticizing GOP lawmakers for \\\"simultaneously enabling his dangerous corruption and lining his pockets.\\\"None of these people would be making these trips down to see him if he hadn't been president and gathered the kind of power and political popularity that came with the presidency,\\\" Bookbinder told me.In addition to continuing to help Trump profit from his time as president, Bookbinder views the patronage as endorsing Trump's anti-democratic attempt to overturn an election.As for how Trump's arrangement differs from the traditional post-presidency book deal or speaking engagements, Bookbinder said GOP officials' patronage provides \\\"a more direct and obvious benefit.\\\"And to head off the predictable rebuttal to any tweet about Trump's profiteering, what about the Clinton Foundation?The Clintons' nonprofit organization differs significantly from Trump's clubs \\u2014 which isn't to say it's immune from criticism.\\\"It's a nonprofit foundation which is actually doing positive work out there. That doesn't mean it couldn't be an avenue for influence, and that is something where scrutiny can be appropriate,\\\" Bookbinder said. \\\"When it's Mar-a-Lago, the only other thing happening is the steak or the golf course.\\\"Zach Everson is a Washington, D.C.-based journalist reporting on conflicts of interest with President Donald Trump's businesses, most recently for the newsletter 1100 Pennsylvania, Vanity Fair and Politico.

True fans understand this and have learned to read between the lines \\u2014 to notice which people no longer appear in photos or who gets more interview time \\u2014 to determine how the people backstage are altering the fates of those in front of the cameras.But for the more casual viewers of wrestling, the A&E's \\\"Biography\\\" series take on WWE legends might require a bit more of a cheat sheet.After all, WWE wrestles very little with itself and doesn't want to.Despite award-winning producers and directors signing up for the \\\"Biography: WWE Legends\\\" series \\u2014 Joe Lavine, George Roy, Billy Corben and Alfred Spellman, all veterans of ESPN's \\\"30 for 30\\\" and HBO's sports documentaries, among others \\u2014 each profile feels like a more sophisticated version of WWE's own bio packages. (True fans might suspect this is because ring footage was augmented with interviews and \\\"unprecedented access\\\" to the WWE archive.) Each follows a similar narrative: An oddball follows a passion, gets well beaten and poorly paid, finally makes money, is consumed by the life, overcomes trauma and then his body commences total orthopedic collapse.The filmmakers, then, are left to slip the truth past all the unprecedented access they got.Over each of the next eight Sundays, \\\"Biography\\\" will roll out two-hour episodes, each dedicated to a different WWE Superstar: \\\"Stone Cold\\\" Steve Austin, \\\"Rowdy\\\" Roddy Piper, \\\"Macho Man\\\" Randy Savage, Booker T, Shawn Michaels, Mick Foley, Ultimate Warrior and Bret \\\"the Hitman\\\" Hart.Like wrestling itself, the series works on a couple of levels. For those still clinging to the myth that it's all fake, the profiles illuminate a serious craft designed to look deceptively simple and humanizes people often dismissed as cartoons. After all, even WWE talking heads in the series refer to wrestling's everyday demands as \\\"physical abuse.\\\" But, for the most hardcore fans, it's a rich nostalgia trip with enough archival treats to sugarcoat even the worst self-congratulatory aspects of the WWE.WWE has never been able to get out of the way of its own hagiography; it prefers to hope the audience ignores the contradictions. It's the greatest company in wrestling, yet it produced such abysmal programming in the 1990s that it had to be dragged to its own rescue by the same performers it structurally undervalued when it wasn't bungling their opportunities or pushing them aside for an evil dentist, a parody of Ted Turner or a succession of clowns.The filmmakers, then, are left to slip the truth past all the unprecedented access they got.WWE wrestles very little with itself and doesn't want to.What the smart fan knows \\u2014 and what each \\\"Biography\\\" in the series taken together shows \\u2014 is that what trauma each and every one of the people had to overcome wasn't some dark streak of character. What happened to all these men was professional wrestling.Long before Shawn Michaels popped his first oxycodone or Macho Man's dad first shot him up with Deca-Durabolin, someone decided to make the business they're in as relentless as possible in its disregard for a person's ability to remain whole.It is a testament both to Bret the Hitman Hart's status in the wrestling world (and WWE's inability to mask just how totally it strip-mines human beings) that Roddy Piper's \\\"Biography\\\" features the Hitman commenting flatly on injury: \\\"If you can't do it, they'd replace you a few minutes later with somebody else. You learned to be your own doctors. That's kind of the sad thing, is you're your own doctor.\\\"WWE's stab at operatic biographical branding can't quite drown out its tragic leitmotifs.The Corben- and Spellman-produced \\\"Biography\\\" of Randy Savage comes closest to overtly impeaching that WWE-sanctioned narrative, by allowing WWE performer and Chairman Vince McMahon to essentially skewer himself. McMahon's self-satisfaction at mentioning how Savage had to pay out of pocket for his own costumes quietly underlines the kind of conditions that led the WWE's \\\"independent contractors\\\" to consider eating Vicodin like Altoids as a cost-effective alternative to taking a day off to pay for a doctor to tell them to take even more days off.It's not all gloom, of course. Mick Foley, who is also profiled, not only penned a wonderful memoir in 2000 \\u2014 \\\"Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks\\\" \\u2014 but went on to become a fundraiser and spokesperson for the sexual abuse survivors charity RAINN. He also spent the peak of his career in the league being between something (his words) \\\"a human pincushion\\\" and (a peer's words) \\\"a human Muppet.\\\"And it is impossible to watch the \\\"Biography\\\" of Booker T for any significant length of time without smiling because Booker T radiates joy.But these stories inspire because they are ultimately the successes, the exceptions and the things that WWE chooses to remember. It chooses to remember that Booker T, an African American wrestler, overcame the racism of the industry to become a Grand Slam champion and two-time Hall of Fame inductee \\u2014 without remembering that part of the racism he had to overcome were ideas McMahon and company trotted out for decade upon decade.What happened to all these men was professional wrestling.WWE's stab at operatic biographical branding can't quite drown out the tragic leitmotifs raised by revisiting this same formula: Men who succeeded by being consumed by their jobs, in conditions where their business never stopped feeding on them.Another example of the tragedy comes just 15 minutes into the first \\\"Biography,\\\" that of WWE legend Stone Cold Steve Austin, and it's haunting for older fans. In it, \\\"Stunning\\\" Steve Austin, before he was Stone Cold and then a member of the Hollywood Blonds, stands on the top of the cage, slashes his thumb across his throat in a gesture made famous by the wrestler \\\"Canadian Crippler\\\" Chris Benoit, and then launches into a frog splash, the high-flying finisher made famous by Eddie Guerrero.All three men were born within three years of one another; all three went on to become World Champions. At age 56, Austin is the only one who isn't dead. Guerrero died of heart failure at 38, thought to have been exacerbated by steroid use. Benoit killed himself at age 40 after first killing his wife and 7-year-old son and was later found to have advanced dementia from chronic concussions.As \\\"Big Sexy\\\" Kevin Nash, who spoke to \\\"Biography\\\" about the death of Randy Savage \\u2014 who died of a heart attack at 58, which he suffered while driving \\u2014 said, \\\"There are so many of these guys who were so tormented, then you hear that they died \\u2014 it's like the life of a kamikaze pilot.\\\"As WWE's talking heads reiterate, wrestling's greatest characters augment something real about the performer himself. And the combination of personalities taken to an extreme and bodies in extremis create the sport's blend of reality and opera, of sacrifice and betrayal.When Shawn Michaels mouths \\\"I love you\\\" before delivering the sweet chin music kick that ends his heroes' career, what brings tears to your eyes should be the agony of seeing a soul you've known for 20 years broken by its own love and ambition. What WWE hopes is that it's just pretty enough you don't think too hard about everything else broken along the way.Jeb Lund is a freelance writer and former political columnist and reporter for Rolling Stone and The Guardian.

Like Nic Pizzolatto\\u2019s 2014 anthology series, \\u201CMare of Easttown\\u201D is as much about an immersion into a particular time and place \\u2014 a small town, a working-class place \\u2014 as it is the case.This time, though, Academy Award winner Kate Winslet leads a cast on HBO Max that features standout performances by Evan Peters and Jean Smart. The place is Delco, aka Delaware County, Pennsylvania, a stretch of blue-collar former factory towns left behind by 21st-century technological prosperity (and regularly ignored by Hollywood for the nearby powerhouses of Washington, D.C., and New York). For those who grew up around the area, the accents in the show are an utter delight, including the British-born Winslet nailing the oddity of an \\u201Co\\u201D vowel that is pervasive throughout the region.But there\\u2019s a couple of key difference between \\u201CMare\\u201D and \\u201CTrue Detective.\\u201D First of all, the former is set in the present-day set series \\u2014 though notably just before pandemic times \\u2014 complete with endless vaping by our lead. And unlike Pizzolatto\\u2019s long-form wallow in toxic masculinity and his apparent obsession with manliness, \\u201CMare\\u201D focuses on women, showing them as the foundations holding together both families in this no-longer-middle-class area and the town as a whole.In the end though, it\\u2019s less about whodunit and more about Mare\\u2019s own introspection.Winslet plays the titular Mare Sheehan, who is the local detective of Easttown. She is, of course, jaded, with 20 years of experience and the demeanor of a woman who is exhausted with where her life choices led. But, in an unusual twist for the genre, she\\u2019s no Sherlock-like genius: She doesn\\u2019t look at the clues and start magically solving puzzles.Rather, she\\u2019s the town detective because everyone knows who she is, and she knows everyone. Her visits to check reports of peeping Toms are as much welfare visits to make sure the older callers are doing OK. She has the squad car take the addict she just arrested to the shelter, not the jail. Her backup nearly faints at the sight of blood, but he\\u2019s good at calling the gas company to get the heat turned back on for the petty thief who is stealing valuables from his sister.Mare isn\\u2019t \\u201Csolving crimes\\u201D as much as she is just keeping the town running.But by treating her job as more social work than bloodhound, Mare left herself unprepared to handle the more serious crimes, let alone murder, which is why, when the story starts, she\\u2019d let the disappearance of the daughter of an old friend slide, insisting the girl did drugs and probably was a suicide. Any other answer would require her to ask uncomfortable questions of those who trust her.\\u201CMare\\u201D focuses on women, showing them as the foundations holding together both families and the town as a whole.Once teen mom Erin McMenamin (Cailee Spaeny) turns up dead at the end of the first episode, though \\u2014 this being HBO, the dead bodies are nubile young women, and there are doses of male violence splattered in between \\u2014 Mare can\\u2019t ignore the real problems in Easttown.Mare then finds herself paired up with a young hotshot detective sent by the county \\u201Cto assist,\\u201D Colin Zabel (Peters). It\\u2019s familiar territory in television: the odd-couple cops, insider and outsider, trying to solve crime together. But, like the cases themselves, the pairing is as much an excuse to dive into Mare\\u2019s psyche and the small town that she loves even as it suffocates her.And Mare is suffocating. A broken marriage after her son\\u2019s suicide left her particularly prickly and unlikable. A woman in her mid-40s, she\\u2019s trying to raise her grandson after her son\\u2019s death with the help of her own mother, Helen (Smart), and desperate to convince her daughter, Siobhan (Angourie Rice), to chase dreams that will get her out of Easttown rather than \\u201Cfame\\u201D in a local band. All the while, she\\u2019s handling the revelation that her ex-husband, Frank (David Denman), who bought the house right behind her in an attempt at a \\u201Cgood divorce,\\u201D is now engaged to his new girlfriend.But mostly what Mare is drowning in is the realization that whatever dreams she might have had for her life are gone. The series makes a big deal in the opening episode that her crowning glory was winning a basketball game for the state championship at age 18. But she\\u2019s also surrounded by others whose moments have come and gone: the women in town who were on her team back then, who are also stuck in their own dead ends, with all their energy focused on keeping their families and town on track as best they can.Even the outsiders seem to get stuck there after having done just one good thing, whether it\\u2019s Mare\\u2019s potential love interest, the has-been writer Richard Ryan (Guy Pearce), or her new partner, Zabel, who is still riding the glory of having cracked one big case and rapidly realizing it might have been the highlight of his career.\\u201CMare of Easttown\\u201D is designed to be a limited series, so the self-contained aspect helps heighten both the character development and mystery-driven aspects of the series. In the end though, it\\u2019s less about whodunit and more about Mare\\u2019s own introspection. She may figure out who is killing the town\\u2019s girls, but we\\u2019re really rooting for her to solve the mystery of how to keep living when the world just keeps dragging you down.Ani Bundel has been blogging professionally since 2010.

The candidates, 11 Republicans, 10 Democrats and two others, are running in a jungle primary to represent Texas' 6th Congressional District and replace Ron Wright, a Republican who had won a second term but died this year after contracting Covid-19.No candidate is likely to clear the 50 percent threshold to win outright on May 1. The two who might make the runoff appear to be anyone's guess, and as Election Day nears, candidates have been fighting for headlines and for the attention of the nearly 1-to-1 ratio of candidates to potential voters at some forums and events.\\\"It's like 'The Real Housewives' meets the Kardashians meets '90 Day Fiancé,'\\\" said Sery Kim, a former Trump administration official who is in the running. \\\"You don't know what's going to happen.\\\"Depending on how a runoff shakes out, the battle for the once-safe GOP district that has trended to the left in recent years could offer some clues about whether embracing Trump helps or hurts Republicans in a contested race, a key question ahead of the 2022 midterms as Democrats hope to hang on to slim majorities in Congress. But such a chaotic field, and the nature and timing of special elections more generally, will likely obscure any broad lessons, experts said.\\\"If we get a Democrat versus a Republican in what seems like an inevitable runoff, I do think it'll be an interesting test of party strength in the usually Republican but Trump-skeptical suburbs,\\\" Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said in an email. \\\"I am not sure we'll get such a runoff \\u2014 there is a huge field of candidates, and we could see two members of the same party get through.\\\"Of his nearly two dozen challengers, it's the 6-foot-7 Rodimer who is giving Trump the biggest bear hug. With early polling having shown Rodimer barely registering in the deep GOP field, he, like many of his opponents, has been on a quest to boost his name recognition. How much they're tying that effort to Trump varies greatly. A few of the Republican candidates have appealed for an endorsement from Trump, who hasn't made any selection. A representative for Trump did not respond to requests for comment.Wright's widow, Susan Wright, a longtime activist in local GOP politics, is considered the Republican front-runner. She and another top GOP contender, state Rep. Jake Ellzey, have largely avoided mention of Trump, and Michael Wood, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, has steered into an explicitly anti-Trump lane.Perhaps that's a result of the North Texas district's voting trend over the past decade. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney won the district in 2012 by 17 points, but Trump won it last fall by just 3. Wright won his last election by about 9 points, and the seat has been held by a Republican since 1983.At Republican voter forums last week, most candidates were questioned about border security and their records, their work in local politics and their views about government spending, while a few candidates sought to boost their Trump bona fides. Travis Rodermund, a local police officer, told voters at a forum in Waxahachie that had he been in Congress for the Jan. 6 vote count, he would have \\\"stood on my chair\\\" and shouted \\\"false election.\\\"In interviews, voters said they were left most impressed by Wright, Kim and former Trump administration official Brian Harrison.Harrison, who has touted his record as chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services, has distributed mailers showing him standing alongside Trump in the Oval Office. Mailers from candidates like Wright and Ellzey are devoid of Trump's image.Michael Egan, another former Trump administration official in the race, said: \\\"There's a lot of people that want to frame this as a referendum on Trump. And I sort of reject that framework myself.\\\"Kim said that while Trump policy, particularly on the economy and China, \\\"very much resonates\\\" with Republican voters, there was reason not to emulate him too closely.\\\"I do think that a lot of people don't like the Twitter, so, if you embrace his techniques and how he became ubiquitous, people don't necessarily like that,\\\" she said. \\\"But they want you to fight. They want you to promote the policies.\\\"During a candidates forum weeks ago, Sery made headlines for saying about China and potential Chinese immigrants: \\\"I don't want them here at all.\\\"\\\"They steal our intellectual property, they give us coronavirus, they don't hold themselves accountable,\\\" she said, adding: \\\"I can say that because I'm Korean.\\\"Kim insists that she was referring specifically to the Chinese Communist Party, and she has said she welcomes those fleeing the regime. But the episode lost her key GOP endorsements and became the subject of national criticism.\\\"The positive aspects of all of this is that certainly everyone knows my name,\\\" she said. \\\"It's very Googleable. People are paying attention to it. The downside of it is, forever, people are going to say, 'Oh, Sery Kim is a racist.' They're going to use it to not read the actual substance of it.\\\"Rodimer, who only recently arrived in Texas, was subjected to some mockery after an ad that featured him and a stunt double riding a bull went viral. He said the attention helped him land interviews with outlets like CNN and \\\"Inside Edition,\\\" which would in turn boost his ability to cross the aisle in Congress.Then there's Wood, who said he voted for Trump last year but was \\\"disheartened\\\" by his actions after the election, particularly the lies about widespread voter fraud that inspired a deadly attack on the Capitol. Wood, who was awarded two Purple Hearts for his military service, tells voters that it's time to move past Trump and to stop embracing conspiracies. Backed by Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., a frequent Trump critic, Wood said he knows his path to the runoff is narrow, pinning his hopes on the huge field and the chance that other GOP candidates could split a pro-Trump vote.\\\"I don't like that the Republican Party has become a cult of personality and sort of a haven for conspiracy theorists,\\\" he said. \\\"I think the rest of the party is going to get to where I am eventually, or we can do it after we lose in '22, '24, '26 and cede the country to the Democrats for a generation.\\\"Wright, meanwhile, has an advantage that has nothing to do with Trump or her longtime activism in GOP politics, experts said.\\\"If she ends up winning, and winning impressively, it could be because of voters showing deference to her as a widow \\u2014 which might make the race less meaningful as a test of broader party strength in the first months of the Biden era,\\\" Kondik said.Local Democrats have sought to manage expectations, especially after last fall's disappointing results across the state. Some even expressed concern that a Democrat could get locked out of the top two spots.\\\"Setting aside the absurd number of candidates and the likely low turnout, the district remains a likely Republican seat, with the Democratic track record, of late, pretty poor in flipping their targets,\\\" Joshua Blank, research director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas, said in an email. \\\"Democrats will be happy to have a candidate in the likely run-off.\\\"Jana Lynne Sanchez, who ran for the seat in 2018, is considered the party's front-runner, along with contenders like Lydia Bean, a former state House candidate; Shawn Lassiter, a nonprofit leader and educator; and the Rev. Patrick Moses.Sanchez, who lost her 2018 race to Wright by about 7 points, said this election feels different.\\\"Nobody, I mean, literally nobody, thought this district was winnable\\\" two years ago, she said. \\\"So trying to build a campaign in a time that nobody saw the potential was incredibly frustrating and really hard work.\\\"Democrats here have focused on the widespread power outages this month and the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, as well as kitchen table issues.Much like their Republican counterparts, Democrats are contending with the sheer size of the field.\\\"A lot of folks, we'll call them, they say, 'Yeah, we'll vote for the Democrat,'\\\" Bean said. \\\"We have to explain to them that they have to know that they should go in knowing you're voting for Lydia Bean.\\\"Bean said the experience of competing in a jungle primary against so many \\\"Trump Republicans\\\" was like \\\"being on the set of 'Suicide Squad.'\\\"Lassiter said she hopes national Democrats \\\"take this race serious.\\\"\\\"This is a flippable district. We've seen in the last decade that District 6 has become closer. It's been trending closer and closer to blue,\\\" she said. \\\"We've seen Tarrant County flip blue. We've seen Fort Worth turn blue. Arlington. And so the votes are here, and I want to just create some urgency around this race for Democrats that we can win this.\\\"Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"NAACP, teachers union part of group buying $1M ad spot in federal voting rights bill fight","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/politics\/elections\/naacp-teachers-union-part-group-buying-1m-ad-spot-federal-n1264426","content":"A coalition of 15 prominent political organizations, advocates and labor groups is taking its support of a sweeping federal voting rights bill to the airwaves with a million-dollar ad campaign set to debut Monday, the group said.It is the first major ad campaign for the Democracy for All 2021 Action coalition, which includes the NAACP, the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Teachers, the progressive groups MoveOn and Demos Action, the environmental groups the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters, and the Working Families Party.The 30-second spots will air in New Hampshire, Georgia, Arizona and Washington, D.C.\\\"It's a matter of making sure that the public knows what the real deal is and making sure that the Senate knows that we're watching,\\\" said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. \\\"Those who have been disenfranchised know they've been disenfranchised, but we need to make the case to the public that none of us should lose the protection of the most sacred right we have in the United States, which is the right to vote and to elect our political leaders.\\\"The ads spotlight a voter in the three states whose experience would be particularly affected by voting restrictions or by the expansions that would be mandated by the For the People Act \\u2014 or both.The legislation, which passed in the House last month, seeks to change campaign finance, voting and ethics laws. The bill would also expand access to the ballot box in many states by creating federal standards for voting access, including automatic voter registration, early voting, and modernized voting systems.\\\"We represent millions of people who are directly impacted by what happens in Washington, and we just want to make sure those voices aren't lost in some of the wonky discussion,\\\" Dan Kalik, senior political adviser at MoveOn, said of the coalition's large membership base.In one ad, a New Hampshire teacher and father says he won't be able to vote if the lines are too long, pointing out that the state doesn't have any early voting options. In another, a Georgia hotel worker says she's tired of having her vote suppressed. In Arizona, a disabled veteran says he can't stand in line to exercise his voting rights and worries that lawmakers are making it harder to vote by mail.The ads will air on broadcast through Sunday and online through April 26. The For the People Act is expected to get its first debate in the Senate on May 11, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., chair of the Rules and Administration Committee, which will initially work on the bill.The fight over voting rights has reached new heights: Hundreds of corporations and business leaders signed a joint letter last week opposing discriminatory voting legislation, and top private law firms began forming a coalition to send lawyers to fight restrictions that pass in court.Republicans have pushed back against the corporate pressure campaign, arguing that legislation is critical to restore trust in elections. Former President Donald Trump repeatedly and falsely claimed that the 2020 election was stolen from him by fraud. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in U.S. voting systems; by all official accounts, the election was secure, and the results were certified as accurate.More than 350 restrictive voting bills are under consideration in 47 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law; advocates say that highlights the acute need for federal voting legislation, which they say would block the vast majority of the restrictions being weighed in the states.\\\"When we began to look at the law that was passed in Georgia, it feels eerily similar to some of the efforts in the 1930s, '40s, '50s to really suppress the vote of African Americans,\\\" said Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP. \\\"That should not be tolerated.\\\"Ralph Quintana, the disabled veteran featured in the Arizona ad, said that he is a registered independent and that he believes the For the People Act would make politicians more responsive to voters across the board.\\\"We should be making it easier for people to vote, and what I see happening countrywide is the opposite,\\\" he said. \\\"I truly believe H.R. 1\\\/S.R. 1 will make both parties have to appeal to the voters more.

A panel of expert advisors to U.S. health agencies will meet later this week to determine whether the pause should continue, with a decision expected as early as Friday. \\\"My estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form,\\\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to President Joe Biden, said Sunday on NBC's \\\"Meet the Press.\\\" \\u201CI do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment.\\\"Scientists have yet to establish a direct link between the J&J vaccine and the unusual blood clots, which have also been identified among a tiny fraction of people who received AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine outside of the United States. It is not clear how long it would take to determine whether the vaccines cause such symptoms.In the meantime, however, scientists say that both vaccines remain important tools to help combat a coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 3 million people globally. The key will be communicating to doctors and patients how to look out for a \\u201Cone-in-a-million\\u201D side effect.\\\"It made sense to pause it,\\\" said Dr. Rishi Mehta, associate medical director of inpatient operations at Keck Hospital at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, referring to use of the J&J vaccine. \\\"We should say: \\u2018Listen the side effects are rare, but there is a potential for you to get them and these are what you should look out for... We are talking about headaches, abdominal pain, confusion.\\\"The American Heart Association on Friday said other potential symptoms, which could occur up to two weeks after vaccination, are:Doctors will also need to be vigilant when it comes to treatment. Cases identified so far are of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), or blood clots in the brain's veins, rather than in the arteries, which is the case for most strokes.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said patients who exhibit clot-related symptoms after receiving the J&J vaccine should not be given heparin, a blood thinner that is widely used to treat clotting disorders, at least until additional testing to determine whether they have low platelet counts. The rare combination of clotting and low platelets signals a condition called heparin-associated thrombocytopenia, and giving heparin can cause harm.The FDA warned healthcare providers that use of heparin in these cases could even be fatal and advised them to strongly consider non-heparin anticoagulants and high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) instead.\\\"You would need to do a few tests with anyone who has symptoms like this, and based on those tests, you would be reasonably positioned to treat without putting the person at risk,\\u201D Dr. Jeffrey Berger, a cardiologist focused on blood clotting disease at New York University.According to details published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Friday, a 48-year-old woman who had the J&J shot was transferred to the University of Nebraska Medical Center after being diagnosed with extensive blood clotting, or thrombosis. She was treated with heparin, but her condition worsened and she was switched to a different anticoagulant and IVIG. The patient remained critically ill at the time of the report.\\\"If they give heparin they can make matters worse, so that's a good reason to call the attention to this,\\\" Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Reuters.Doctors said the pause in J&J vaccinations allows time for hospital systems to update their own recommendations.\\\"It's certainly a very serious condition, but there are recommendations for treatment,\\\" said Dr. Annabelle de St. Maurice, infectious disease specialist, University of California at Los Angeles. \\\"Prior to this, someone who had the vaccine and had a headache, our first idea wouldn't be to consider CVST and order the labs and imaging to assess that.\\\"Officials at J&J and AstraZeneca did not immediately respond to requests for comment."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Otters at Georgia Aquarium test positive for Covid-19","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/otters-georgia-aquarium-test-positive-covid-19-n1264431","content":"Otters at an aquarium in Atlanta have tested positive for Covid-19 but are expected to make full recoveries.\\\"They began exhibiting mild respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny noses, mild lethargy, and some began coughing,\\\" the Georgia Aquarium said in a statement.The aquarium said the Asian small-clawed otters are doing well.\\\"Despite following all recommended health and safety protocols, it is suspected the otters may have acquired the infection from an asymptomatic staff member,\\\" the aquarium said in the statement, which was posted to Facebook.Such transmission is rare, and the otters are off exhibit while they recover.

Almost 84 million adults, or about 32.5 percent of the population, have been fully vaccinated.The U.S. cleared the 50 percent mark just a day after the reported global death toll from the coronavirus topped a staggering 3 million, according to totals compiled by Johns Hopkins University, though the actual number is believed to be significantly higher.The country\\u2019s vaccination rate, at 61.6 doses administered per 100 people, currently falls behind Israel, which leads among countries with at least 5 million people with a rate of 119.2. The U.S. also trails the United Arab Emirates, Chile and the United Kingdom, which is vaccinating at a rate of 62 doses per 100 people, according to Our World in Data, an online research site.The vaccine campaign offered hope in places like Nashville, Tennessee, where the Music City Center bustled Sunday with vaccine seekers. High demand for appointment-only shots at the convention center has leveled off enough that walk-ins will be welcome starting this week.Amanda Grimsley, who received her second shot, said she\\u2019s ready to see her 96-year-old grandmother, who lives in Alabama and has been nervous about getting the vaccine after having a bad reaction to a flu shot.\\u201CIt\\u2019s a little emotional.

It\\u2019s trailed only by Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi \\u2014 three other Southern states that lean Republican and voted for Donald Trump last fall.Vaccination rates do not always align with how states vote. But polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research has shown trends that link political leanings and attitudes about the vaccines and other pandemic-related issues.A poll conducted in late March found that 36 percent of Republicans said they will probably or definitely not get vaccinated, compared with 12 percent of Democrats. Similarly, a third of rural Americans said they were leaning against getting shots, while fewer than a fourth of people living in cities and suburbs shared that hesitancy.Overall, though, willingness to get vaccinated has risen, polling shows.In January, 67 percent of adult Americans were willing to get vaccinated or had already received at least one shot. The figure has climbed to 75 percent, according to the latest AP-NORC poll.Nationwide, 24 percent of Black Americans and 22 percent of Hispanic Americans say they will probably or definitely not get vaccinated, down from 41 percent and 34 percent in January, respectively. Among white Americans, 26 percent now say they will not get vaccinated. In January, that number was 31 percent.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said the goal is to get community figures, from athletes to clergy, to encourage vaccinations, particularly as the seven-day national average of cases remains over 60,000 new infections per day.\\u201CWhat we are doing is we\\u2019re trying to get, by a community core, trusted messages that anyone would feel comfortable with listening to, whether you\\u2019re a Republican, a Democrat, an independent or whomever you are, that you\\u2019re comfortable,\\u201D Fauci said Sunday on ABC's \\u201CThis Week.\\u201DFauci also indicated Sunday that the government will likely move to resume use of Johnson & Johnson\\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine this week, possibly with restrictions or broader warnings after reports of some very rare blood clot cases.In a series of news show interviews, Fauci said he expects a decision when advisers to the CDC meet Friday to discuss the pause in J&J\\u2019s single-dose vaccine.\\u201CI would be very surprised if we don\\u2019t have a resumption in some form by Friday,\\u201D he said. \\\"I don\\u2019t really anticipate that they\\u2019re going to want it stretch it out a bit longer.\\u201DFauci, who is President Joe Biden\\u2019s chief medical adviser, said he believed that federal regulators could bring the shots back with limits based on age or gender or with a blanket warning, so that it is administered in a way \\u201Ca little bit different than we were before the pause.\\u201DThe J&J vaccine was thrown in limbo after the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration said last week they needed more evidence to decide if a handful of unusual blood clots were linked to the shot \\u2014 and if so, how big the risk is.The reports are rare \\u2014 six cases out of more than 7 million U.S. inoculations with J&J vaccine.

This Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\u2019s vaccine advisory committee will examine further data about those concerns.Fauci said that he hopes that America will \\u201Cget back on track\\u201D with the vaccine after that meeting, but admitted that it\\u2019s possible there could be new restrictions or warnings related to the use of Johnson & Johnson\\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine.\\u201CEverything is on the table,\\u201D he said in an interview on \\u201CMeet the Press.\\u201D\\u201CMy estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form,\\\" said Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser. \\\"I doubt very seriously if they just cancel it.

So far, the data suggests the clots are extremely rare, with just a handful of possible cases out of the more than 6.8 million doses of the vaccine administered in the U.S.But Fauci noted that that the normal course of treatment for other blood clots could make this specific issue worse, and said that the pause also gave time to inform doctors of that potentially dangerous complication.\\u201CThere\\u2019s a twofold reason for doing it: One, to pause and take a look in more detail about it,\\u201D Fauci said about the rare clots, \\u201Cand two, to make sure that the physicians treat people appropriately.\\\"With the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine sidelined for now, the U.S. has been leaning on vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, which have been the cornerstone of the country\\u2019s vaccination strategy.

The clinic still vaccinates up to 100 people per day, but the center\\u2019s waitlist has shortened. The number of no-shows at an April 10 drive-thru clinic was the highest the department had seen.Now, Young said, \\u201Cyou almost have to reach out to get appointments.\\u201DWest Virginia, the first state in the nation to widely vaccinate residents of long-term care facilities, is now among the first to confront the question of what happens when demand begins to taper off.The state\\u2019s coronavirus response czar, Dr. Clay Marsh, said a number of local health departments have asked the state to pause sending additional doses until they can use up their backlog.\\u201CWe\\u2019re seeing vaccine hesitancy more than we\\u2019ve seen before,\\u201D he said. And amid a recent rise in coronavirus cases to levels not seen since late February and with the state still well short of herd immunity, he added, \\u201CWe are very worried about what could happen to West Virginia if we don\\u2019t really vaccinate enough of our population.\\u201DOn Feb. 14, West Virginia reported that nearly 98 percent of the vaccine doses the state had received from the federal government had been administered. By April 15, that figure had fallen to nearly 72 percent. The drop of about 26 percentage points is the steepest in the nation, according to an NBC News analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Louisiana, Montana and Wyoming are also among states seeing the greatest slowdowns.Public health officials say there are many reasons for the rising surplus of vaccine doses sitting on shelves. Before vaccine production ramped up, providers often maxed out quickly as residents at the greatest risk from the virus scrambled to book scarce appointments. But as availability continues to swell, there are new challenges: how quickly front-line workers are able to push out the shots, whether those who want to get vaccinated face barriers in doing so \\u2014 and, most significantly, hesitancy among some residents to get vaccinated at all.Recent polling shows that although vaccine hesitancy is on the decline, 17 percent of Americans still want to \\u201Cwait and see\\u201D before getting a shot, a figure that rises to 24 percent among Black Americans. Doctors and nurses say it\\u2019s still common to hear from patients fearing complications that they\\u2019re not ready to make an appointment. Public health officials and front-line workers say that not all of that opposition derives from concerns of safety or effectiveness. Polls show Republicans are among the most likely to say they won\\u2019t receive a jab at all.The CDC figures showing a drop in the share of vaccinations administered in many states does not yet reflect the potential impact of the federally recommended pause this week on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, as officials investigate whether the inoculation contributed to rare blood clots. Although public health workers said the suspension is a sign of transparency, they\\u2019re bracing for a potential fallout that could deter those who were already reluctant.Now, health care workers in states that have seen a slowdown in demand are planning for the work they\\u2019ll have to put in to bring more people through their doors.In Wyoming, which experienced the second largest overall drop in vaccine doses used after West Virginia, public health officials are ramping up their focus on messaging.\\u201CWith schools and most businesses open, it may be harder for some people to see the personal need for vaccination,\\u201D Kim Deti, a spokesperson for the Wyoming Department of Health, said.Louisiana State Health Officer Dr. Joseph Kanter said the number of doses administered has been \\u201Cfairly steady\\u201D as supply to the state has increased, when the goal is to see a rise in vaccinations.\\u201CWhatever hesitancy that existed before was a little bit plastered over because supply was so limited,\\u201D he said.While West Virginia is coping with a steep drop in the share of shots administered, some states have struggled to whittle down their stockpiles since the beginning. At their peaks, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Arkansas and Tennessee used less than 85 percent of their doses, and as of April 15 they\\u2019ve used less than 70 percent, the lowest in the nation.Alabama has seen a 13 percentage point decrease in shots administered. Dr. Karen Landers, assistant state health officer at the Alabama State Department of Health, said part of the reason may be because there\\u2019s a perception that improved case numbers in the state means the risk of contracting the coronavirus isn\\u2019t as high.\\u201CCovid is still here and still circulating,\\u201D she said. \\u201CWe need to have everyone vaccinated.\\u201DIn January, Mississippi\\u2019s appointment site struggled to handle the surge of statewide demand for doses at massive drive-thru clinics. Now, open slots linger in the thousands. In Hinds County, Mississippi\\u2019s most populous county, more than 5,000 windows were unreserved as of Friday afternoon.Mississippi\\u2019s State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said on Tuesday that in some areas the state\\u2019s \\u201Cuptake is not quite as rapid as before.\\u201D The health agency will shift more vaccines to doctor\\u2019s offices and focus resources on areas with low vaccination rates.Dr. Andrea Phillips, a physician in Jackson, Mississippi\\u2019s capital, said there aren\\u2019t enough patients at her small practice to use all of the doses recently sent by the state. Earlier this month, a local church reached out asking if she would coordinate a vaccination event, to help ensure each shot would be claimed.One parishioner volunteering at the site initially declined to get vaccinated. The woman was unsure whether being prone to seizures would lead to complications. Phillips explained how her condition could put her at greater risk if she contracted the virus and the woman decided to get the shot.Beyond hesitancy, spotty internet access and lack of transportation are persistent barriers in Mississippi, particularly for Black residents and those in rural areas. Serious illness or mobility issues can also make it harder for those who are among the most vulnerable to the disease to reach vaccination sites. Phillips has made home visits but said there are more people to reach.\\u201CThe fact that people don\\u2019t get online and sign up for something, or sit in a line, does not mean they don\\u2019t want the vaccine,\\u201D she said.Phillips drew laughs from staff members when she asked whether they should set up an information table outside of a local nightclub. But she made it clear she was serious. The clubs are still packed on weekends, she pointed out.Part of that, she believes, derives from a series of contradicting messages.Gov. Tate Reeves has urged residents to get vaccinated and received the shot himself on camera. But he\\u2019s also directed barbs at President Joe Biden, who criticized his decision to lift the state\\u2019s mask mandate.Phillips believes the removal, despite Reeves encouraging Mississippians to exercise their individual choices and wear a mask, \\u201Csignals to people we\\u2019re OK\\u201D and there\\u2019s less urgency to get vaccinated.One-on-one conversations with trusted health care providers or community leaders might be the key in tipping the undecided toward vaccination.Kanter, the Louisiana state health officer, said the \\u201Csweet spot\\u201D is \\u201Cpeople who haven\\u2019t written off the vaccine,\\u201D but aren\\u2019t \\u201Cquite ready\\u201D to get it yet.That\\u2019s where Tara Gallion, who works as a nurse at the Delta Health Center, which provides low-cost care in the Mississippi Delta, has found success. She said it\\u2019s not uncommon to have lengthy conversations with patients reluctant to get vaccinated.She doesn't miss the opportunity to ask neighbors, or relatives bringing older relatives to the clinic, if they\\u2019re interested too.Last week, she offered the shot to two women who brought their mother to the clinic. At first, they resisted.\\u201CThey felt like they were young and invincible,\\u201D Gallion said.She asked them a series of questions. Both told her they had children and worked in retail.Gallion told them the vaccine wasn\\u2019t just for them \\u2014 it was to stay healthy and protect their families.\\u201CIf you do get it, you\\u2019ll have something to help your body fight against it,\\u201D she said.The prodding worked, but there\\u2019s a question of how many will make it to this step.While people of varying political backgrounds have been vaccinated, surveys about vaccine views show the push has not been spared from the nation\\u2019s polarization.\\u201CPoliticization is a concern, of course,\\u201D Deti, the Wyoming health department spokesperson, said.A March poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that Republicans were the most likely to express vaccine hesitancy; almost 30 percent responded \\u201Cdefinitely not\\u201D when asked whether they would receive the shot.That could leave states with strong Republican bases, like West Virginia, at a greater disadvantage.Ken Reed and his wife, Tally, run a pharmacy chain in the eastern region of West Virginia. Reed, who is also a Republican state legislator, said some in the communities they serve will \\u201Cquietly\\u201D get vaccinated, but \\u201Cstill fuss.\\u201DHe often appeals on social media that vaccinations are a pathway to easing restrictions. On occasion, he tries to nudge those on the fence by letting them know when doses are available.Some will respond, \\u201CYes, I\\u2019ll get the vaccine just to speed this up.\\u201DOthers, he said, see their refusal as keeping in lockstep with what Reed considers libertarian beliefs about limited government. Some view the urgings from government officials to become vaccinated as an infringement, or being \\u201Ctold what to do,\\u201D he said. It\\u2019s a subset he\\u2019s not sure can be convinced by presenting evidence of vaccination trials or answering questions.After a year of attempting to drive down the pandemic, the recalcitrance is draining.\\u201CIt\\u2019s starting to bump heads a little bit,\\u201D he said.But there\\u2019s little choice to do anything else but try to break through.Bracey Harris is a national reporter for NBC News, based in Jackson, Mississippi. Nigel Chiwaya is a deputy data editor for NBC News."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"'It physically hurts': Black men are in mourning for George Floyd \u2014 and themselves","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/nbcblk\/it-physically-hurts-black-men-are-mourning-george-floyd-themselves-n1264353","content":"Tears streamed down Kenneth L.

A 20-year-old got shot and killed over nothing,\\\" he added, referring to Daunte Wright, who was shot in Minnesota last week by Brooklyn Center police Officer Kim Potter. Her police chief, Tim Gannon, said he thought she intended to use a stun gun on Wright during a traffic stop but mistakenly fired her service weapon. Wright died, and Potter and Gannon resigned a day before Potter was charged with second-degree manslaughter.\\u201CIf you\\u2019re Black in this country, especially a Black man, you can\\u2019t help but be emotional about this stuff. We are targets. That\\u2019s the painful reality,\\u201D Johnson said.Rodney Coates, a sociologist focusing on social justice and social policy at Miami University in Ohio, said the pain he and other Black men feel is visceral, originating from a history of abuse.\\\"This whole case is symbolic of the past,\\\" Coates said. \\\"I have intentionally tried to not watch the trial and the video. It brings me back to the middle passage and how horrific that was. America has consistently targeted the Black male. Derek Chauvin is not on trial. The American justice system is on trial.\\\"\\\"As Black men, we want affirmation that our lives matter,\\\" Coates continued. \\\"I am George Floyd. I am the people who were there watching his life seep out of him after he pleaded for his mother. All of these images are traumatic.\\\"White, the engineer, said the pain of the visual is magnified by the notion that there likely will be another Black man needlessly killed by law enforcement. Worse, he added, is that there are not enough people who feel the Black man\\u2019s hurt.\\\"Racism today is more cerebral,\\\" White said. \\\"It\\u2019s not the KKK burning down your house. But it\\u2019s cases like this, where people believe it\\u2019s acceptable for a \\u2018good white man to harm and kill a bad Black man.\\u2019 We\\u2019re always the \\u2018bad\\u2019 guy.\\\"\\\"When they have that mentality, they put George Floyd on trial,\\\" White continued. \\\"And when they do that, they put all Black men on trial. If you\\u2019re a Black man, you know this could happen to you \\u2014 and no one could be held accountable for it. And that\\u2019s unacceptable.\\\"Coates agreed: \\u201CThis is all a form of white privilege. Their position is \\u2018It doesn\\u2019t impact me. It\\u2019s not my kids being killed. I don\\u2019t have to worry when I get stopped by a cop. I\\u2019m not being traumatized and re-traumatized.\\u2019 White people were not particularly concerned when they were lynching Black people, either.

Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, vetoed the measure earlier this month, calling it \\u201Ca vast government overreach.\\u201D But the Arkansas General Assembly overrode the veto, and the bill will become law this summer.Emily Spurrier said when her son heard the news, he sat in her car and cried for an hour.\\u201CIt was just kind of a wave of emotions, thinking about moving and then him worrying about some friends that he has here in the Little Rock area,\\u201D she said. \\u201CAnd then just the thought that this is really the only place he ever remembers living.\\u201DArkansas is the first state in the country to pass a law banning transition care for minors. The measure will bar access to reversible puberty blockers, hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries, though surgeries aren\\u2019t included in global standards of care for transgender minors and aren\\u2019t performed on them in Arkansas, Hutchinson said during his veto.The Spurriers\\u2019 son, who just started using testosterone, will no longer be able to access this physician-prescribed hormone once the new law is implemented, so his family is raising money on GoFundMe to move to New Mexico by August.\\u201CThe benefits are not going to outweigh the dangers of raising our children here in this state.\\u201DAmanda DennisThe Spurriers, along with some families in Texas and North Carolina, which are considering similar legislation, told NBC News they are prepared to move to protect their children.Fourteen states are considering bans or restrictions on transition care for trans minors, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The Williams Institute, a think tank at the UCLA School of Law, found that 45,100 trans youth are at risk of losing access to care because of the proposals. Major medical associations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and the Pediatric Endocrine Society oppose the bills.As of Monday, there were at least 44 bills across 25 states targeting transgender youth, with five of them on governors\\u2019 desks, according to the ACLU and the Human Rights Campaign. A recent PBS NewsHour\\\/NPR\\\/Marist poll found that two-thirds of Americans are opposed to laws that would limit trans rights.George Spurrier said that, in addition to the transition-care ban, the Arkansas Legislature is considering several other bills that create an unsafe environment for his son.\\u201CIf it had been one or two bills, we may have been more optimistic about fighting and getting through all of it,\\u201D he said. \\u201CBut the fact that they just kept coming one after another after another ... has just kind of demoralized us. Even if everything gets defeated or repealed, the spirit behind them is still here, and we just can't help but feel like it's not safe.\\u201DIn addition to the recently passed trans health care bill, Arkansas is considering four other bills targeting LGBTQ people, and the governor has signed two others into law, according to the ACLU. For example, Hutchinson signed a bill into law on March 26 that allows doctors to refuse to treat someone based on their religious or moral beliefs, a measure that advocates say would allow physicians to refuse to treat trans patients even in the emergency room.Another Arkansas family is also facing a deadline. Amanda Dennis, who has lived in the state for most of her life, said her family has about two to three years to figure out how they\\u2019re going to get care for their transgender 8-year-old, Brooke, by the time she begins puberty.\\u201CI will have to fly to another state \\u2014 and the problem is we're surrounded by states that are doing the same thing,\\u201D she said, adding that Kansas, Missouri and Texas are all considering similar bills.Flying to another state wouldn\\u2019t be financially sustainable for the family, Dennis said, and like the Spurriers, she\\u2019s also worried about how other recent laws and proposed bills will affect Brooke. Dennis said her daughter wants to try out for gymnastics, cheerleading and dance, but she wouldn\\u2019t be able to compete on a girls\\u2019 team due to a bill Hutchinson signed in March that bans trans student athletes from competing on teams that align with their gender identity.\\u201CIt breaks my heart that I'm going to have to, at one point, should we choose to stay in Arkansas \\u2026 tell her, \\u2018Brooke, you won't be able to try out for any of these teams.\\u2019\\u201DArkansas is also considering a bill that would prohibit schools from requiring teachers to refer to trans students by a name and pronoun that isn\\u2019t consistent with their sex assigned at birth.\\u201CSo there's more things coming down the pike that will really eventually force us to leave the state,\\u201D Dennis said. \\u201CThe benefits are not going to outweigh the dangers of raising our children here in this state.\\u201DTexas is considering a bill similar to Arkansas\\u2019 transition-care ban, but with criminal penalties. The bill would make it a felony for parents to provide their trans children with access to gender-affirming care. It would classify the act as child abuse, and parents who violate the proposed law could face up to 10 years in prison, have their child removed from their home and face civil litigation.Texas mom Amber Briggle, who lives north of Dallas, testified against the bill last week.\\u201CI\\u2019m afraid that by speaking here today my words will be used against me should SB 1646 or SB 1311 pass, and my sweet son, whom I love more than life itself, will be taken from me,\\u201D she said.Briggle said taking away her son\\u2019s access to care would \\u201Cdestroy him.\\u201D\\u201CWe gave him the support that he needed, and it was like a light switch turned on and like my baby came back to me and was perfect again,\\u201D she told NBC News, adding that the 13-year-old is a straight-A student and a great musician. \\u201CHe can play the opening riff to \\u2018Sweet Child O\\u2019 Mine\\u2019 on his ukulele \\u2014 I will say I taught him that.\\u201DBriggle said to have that familial support taken away would be \\u201Cdevastating\\u201D for her son.\\u201CIt's devastating because he is as successful as he is because he has that support,\\u201D she said. \\u201CIt's also devastating and terrifying to think that taking away that support means taking him away from his family, and placing him with, who knows.\\u201DMoving wouldn\\u2019t be easy for the family, Briggle said. She\\u2019s a small business owner, and her husband is a tenured professor.\\u201CIt'd be really complicated for us, but it's certainly not out of the question,\\u201D she added. \\u201CMy son always comes first.\\u201DTexas\\u2019 bill would also make it a felony for medical providers to administer transition care to minors. Kimberly Shappley, who has a trans 10-year-old named Kai and is a nurse at a clinic that serves LGBTQ people, said it\\u2019s a \\u201Cdouble whammy\\u201D for her, because it would affect both her work and her family.Shappley, a former conservative Christian minister, moved from her small Texas hometown to Austin in 2018, because she said the relatively liberal capital city has more supportive local policies for Kai.\\u201CBut if these laws passed, even Austin can't protect us,\\u201D she said. \\u201CIt'll take everything we have \\u2014 just living in Austin has been super expensive \\u2014 it'll take everything we have to relocate. I'll do it. I'll have to.\\u201DShappley said she wants to see more action from President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Biden released an executive order last month affirming that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects students from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, but he hasn\\u2019t made a statement directly addressing the flurry of bills targeting transgender minors.Shappley said she took time off of work to campaign for the Biden-Harris ticket, so she\\u2019s angry that they haven\\u2019t explicitly mentioned the bills.\\u201CEven if they can't do anything right now, tell us what your plan is,\\u201D Shappley said. \\u201CKamala Harris had a trans flag outside of her office. OK, if you're an ally, why aren't you loudly telling my kid she's gonna be OK? Why aren\\u2019t you loudly saying, \\u2018You know what, Mrs. Shappley, you don't have to move; we\\u2019ve got your back.\\u2019 I want somebody to say something.\\u201DNorth Carolina is also considering a ban on gender-affirming care for minors. Advocates say it would likely be vetoed by Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, but Katie Jenifer and her daughter Maddie said the debate over the bill is itself harmful.\\u201CIf I didn't have my hormones or my [puberty] blocker, I'd be very unhappy, and I wouldn't want to leave the house sometimes,\\u201D Maddie, 13, said.Even if advocates are saying the bill won\\u2019t become law, \\u201Cthere is still the smallest bit of chance, and that alone just makes me very anxious,\\u201D Maddie added.Jenifer said she has told Maddie they would move should the bill or a similar one become law, but she acknowledged not everyone has that option.\\u201CThat's the real crux of the issue: How do we help those families?\\u201D she said.Back in Arkansas, Dennis said Brooke, who\\u2019s currently in third grade, is ready to be part of a potential legal battle against the state\\u2019s new laws.\\u201CShe wants to be someone that can be a light to other kids her age, and she really wants to be a part of the conversation,\\u201D she said, adding that Brooke is \\u201Cready to put on her activist hat and help.\\u201DWhile Dennis said she and her husband are proud of their daughter, \\u201Cat the same time, we do get a little bit sad that an 8-year-old has to be the voice.\\u201DFollow NBC Out on Twitter, Facebook & InstagramJo Yurcaba is an associate editor at NBC Out."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Apple reinstates Parler app, stands by initial ban","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/tech\/tech-news\/apple-reinstates-parler-app-stands-initial-ban-rcna713","content":"Parler, the conservative-oriented social media website that was banned from Apple\\u2019s App Store and several other internet hosting services after the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, has been reinstated.Timothy Powderly, Apple\\u2019s senior director of government affairs, wrote a letter to Sen.

And in December, the 15-year-old known to journalists and fellow protesters simply as \\u201CAurora\\u201D boarded a plane to London, the ticket paid for by an anonymous Hong Kong activist.The decision to seek political asylum in the United Kingdom has made her one of Hong Kong\\u2019s youngest exiles.\\u201CI was very worried about being caught at the airport for seeking asylum in the U.K.,\\u201D the teen, who requested anonymity out of fear that her family would be punished because of her involvement in protests, told NBC News. \\u201CBut on the flight, I finally felt safer and the most relaxed in a long time.\\u201DHer political awakening occurred in June 2019, after an estimated 1 million demonstrators took to the streets to protest an extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents accused of offenses to be sent to mainland China to stand trial.Three days later, on June 12, she and her classmates attended a second rally in a busy commercial district, which devolved into one of the most violent demonstrations Hong Kong has seen in decades. Police fired rubber-coated bullets, tear gas and pepper spray at demonstrators. Some protesters attacked officers and hurled Molotov cocktails at them.She said she was impressed by the activists\\u2019 solidarity.\\u201CI had always thought Hong Kongers are cold to each other, but their unity deeply moved me, and made me burst into tears,\\u201D she said.From then on, she became more politically engaged, reading the news every day, and she formed close bonds with her fellow demonstrators.\\u201CI feel like protesters are more like my family, and they understand me better than my own,\\u201D said the teenager, who added that her mother disapproved of her daughter\\u2019s activism.

If convicted, he faces a potential sentence of life in prison. More recently, in March, 47 pro-democracy politicians were arrested under the new law, the largest crackdown on the movement to date.Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politicsOn Friday, nine leading pro-democracy advocates were sentenced to jail for organizing a march during the 2019 protests that triggered a crackdown from Beijing.The United States and other countries have slapped sanctions on Chinese officials over the crackdown in Hong Kong, with Washington labeling their actions an \\u201Cassault on democracy.\\u201DBeijing has countered that its actions in Hong Kong defend its national sovereignty and has called on other countries \\u201Cto stop interfering\\u201D in its domestic affairs.Larry Lai, a lecturer in the Department of Politics and Public Administration at the University of Hong Kong, said that young protesters tended to want to leave Hong Kong mainly for security reasons.\\u201CThe national security law and how it is enforced justifies their worries,\\u201D he said.The U.K., in particular, has been an attractive destination, due to its close ties with Hong Kong.

It's rooted in racism,\\u201D P.J. Hill, vice president of the NAACP in Minnesota, told NBC News. \\\"We have a lot of symbols of past oppression that we, the community, have to see every day and that deep-rooted symbolism and spirit lingers on.\\\"At age 25, in 1905, Brown inherited a farm north of Minneapolis from his wealthy grandfather.The village of Brooklyn Center formed in 1911 at a meeting on his farm, and \\\"he soon became the settlement\\u2019s most prominent citizen,\\\" according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune.Twice elected Hennepin County sheriff in the 1920s, Brown in 1929 launched the Minnesota highway patrol, serving as chief, the paper reported.However, a revelation about Brown came through the 2013 book \\u201CThe Ku Klux Klan in Minnesota,\\u201D by Elizabeth Dorsey Hatle. She wrote that Brown informed a Minneapolis grand jury in 1923 that he joined the Klan in a spy attempt.Still, Brown, as the acting sheriff, failed to stop other Klan members from meeting and burning crosses, she wrote.While some of those facts have been disputed, the information has recently led to Earle Brown Elementary School being renamed Brooklyn Center Elementary School.The Earle Brown Heritage Center, a conference and event venue, had been considering the same move for several months before Wright was killed.\\u201CThe tragedy of Daunte Wright\\u2019s death has led some to call on the Earle Brown Heritage Center to change its name, since aspects of Mr. Brown\\u2019s past do not reflect our organization\\u2019s commitment to inclusivity and respect for all people.We agree,\\u201D the heritage center wrote on its website.In the decades since Brooklyn Center was founded on Browns\\u2019 farmland, the city has morphed for a multitude of reasons including homeowners searching for affordable suburban housing and residents wanting to leave the rough sections of North Minneapolis, where the majority of Black people live, Hill said.This backstory leads to present-day Brooklyn Center, Wright\\u2019s killing and the protests. Just a short drive away, former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin is standing trial on murder charges in the death of George Floyd.One of Brooklyn Center\\u2019s other claims to fame is that it is known as Minnesota\\u2019s most racially diverse area with a strong community of Liberians, local leaders say. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Brooklyn Center is 29 percent Black, 16 percent Asian and nearly 14 percent Latino.Statewide, Black people make up 7 percent of the population and Asians and Latinos are both about 5 percent.Many immigrants here are from West Africa, particularly Liberia. They are prideful, have made Brooklyn Center their home and feel safe and welcome to some extent, said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the civil rights nonprofit Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR-MN.Hussein has been at the forefront of the citywide peaceful protests all week.\\u201CWhen Covid hit, nobody was interested in sympathy. People were ready to demand for the government to shut borders, to save lives any way they could and expedite a vaccine. People were in the mood for solutions,\\u201D Hussein said. \\u201CBut for police brutality, we have to constantly battle an idea that it's one officer or one incident. The reality is until we pass meaningful police accountability policies, I don't believe that we can start to turn the corner on officer-involved shootings that perpetuate and target people of color.\\u201DBrooklyn Center is also a low-income area, where the median household income is $59,600, compared to the state average of $71,300.Grocery shopping usually resembles a difficult treasure hunt. With stores boarded up or operating during truncated hours in anticipation of vandalism or looting this week, residents have had to turn to stop-gap local resources.Many flocked to Brooklyn Center High School this week, which, since the start of the protests, has been the source of national food and monetary donations.Throngs of people wrapped long lines around the school's gymnasium this week for meaningful fresh produce, canned foods, steaks, Hamburger Helper, fruits, snacks and cases of bottled water.One woman pushed a grocery cart full of Gatorade, paper towels and disinfectant wipes to her Honda truck.Gladys Greene, 26, picked up some basic necessities for her niece.\\\"People are in need at the moment,\\\" Greene said after loading her vehicle with milk, tissue, diapers and baby wipes. \\\"Most of our grocery stores are closed at the moment.\\\"She said she normally drives out of her way to shop at Walmart and Target.\\\"We've had some businesses shut down this week. The first thing we figured out was how we were going to support the need of our community,\\\" said Tara Drey, director of communications for Brooklyn Center Community Schools. \\\"We knew we needed to become a distribution center.\\\"To help out, Scoreboard Pizza, which is inside a strip mall in the heart of where the protests have taken place, has given away boxes of free pizza to peaceful protesters, police officers and city workers.\\\"I don't choose a side,\\\" said Jim Johnson, owner of the 37-year-old pizzeria.He said he watched the riots unfold in front of his business Monday night.\\\"The one bad thing is the looting and setting buildings on fire \\u2014 that I don't agree with,\\\" Johnson said. \\\"But that has nothing to do with the protesters. I watched it all happen. It was just a bunch of youths who were taking advantage of a situation not being boarded up. There were no adults around.\\\"Since the riots however, he has been closing five hours early.Samantha Pree-Stinson, 40, doesn't consider herself a protester but did attend the demonstrations outside the Brooklyn Center police station this week to stand and be counted.She also didn't agree with the riots.\\\"Absolutely not,\\\" she said. \\\"They're burning down our neighborhoods. We've been trying to build up our neighborhoods. The mom-and-pop stores on the corner may not be able to rebuild.\\\"Hussein, who spoke to hundreds of demonstrators this week urging them to take action at the voting polls, said his movement will continue.\\\"We keep asking ourselves why does it keep happening and historically, we have been stuck with this idea that people care about the issue, but people don't care enough about the issue to demand solutions to fix it,\\\" Hussein said.He said officers who threaten the lives of minorities need to be held accountable and that much more work needs to be done.\\\"We're still dealing with the same issues and having the same marches,\\\" Hussein said. \\\"We haven't really taken steps forward.\\\"Follow NBCBLK on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.Deon J.

I was depressed,\\u201D Pritchett said. \\u201CHonestly, I didn\\u2019t know what I was going to do.\\u201DIn May, Pritchett and her daughter packed up and moved 270 miles across Georgia to be closer to her son, Isaiah, 10, who lived with his father near Atlanta. They cried together as they said goodbye to Genesis\\u2019 favorite teacher on FaceTime. They moved into a bedroom in Pritchett\\u2019s best friend\\u2019s house, and often confined themselves inside all day as Genesis did online school and they tried to stay out of their hosts\\u2019 way.Pritchett struggled to contribute to utility payments and worried about being a burden. She considered sending her daughter to live with her mother and living in her car.A major goal of President Joe Biden\\u2019s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package is to help families like that of Pritchett. The American Rescue Plan, which passed in March, could cut the child poverty rate in half. The expanded child tax credit, which families can receive in monthly payments, provides funds to millions of parents who didn\\u2019t qualify previously. The relief package includes other provisions that will help, too, including $39 billion for the nation\\u2019s fractured child care system, which should provide more families with child care assistance.Related: With help slow to come from Washington, a veteran\\u2019s family gets by washing cars, skipping mealsBut some experts say the government needs to do far more to truly address poverty, including strengthening unemployment insurance, raising the minimum wage, ensuring paid leave for families and establishing universal preschool. There are also broader factors that need to change to disrupt the cycle of poverty, like systemic racism.\\u201CChild poverty in the United States is persistent, it\\u2019s structural. But it\\u2019s also really solvable,\\u201D said Areeba Haider, a research associate for the Poverty to Prosperity Program at the Center for American Progress.One way to reduce child poverty, experts say, is to support on-the-ground programs that offer comprehensive \\u201Ctwo-generation\\u201D help, providing services to kids and their parents at the same time. These programs simplify access to assistance for families in crisis while simultaneously addressing the root causes of poverty, including a lack of educational opportunities. They tackle the many intricate issues that, especially when combined, lead to poverty or keep a family in poverty \\u2014 offering a potential model for what it would take to lift up the millions of struggling American families.For Pritchett, things started to look up in the early fall when she learned that a local shelter, Gwinnett Children\\u2019s Shelter, offered a two-generation support program called Home of Hope and had room for her and Genesis. She had also found a job testing routers and modems for an internet company, and now thanks to Home of Hope she had a free place to live, free meals, access to financial planning and a coach who could help her set and reach independent living goals.\\u201CI feel more relieved now,\\u201D she said one afternoon as her daughter played with friends outside their room at Home of Hope. \\u201CI feel so much better since we came here. A weight has been lifted off my shoulders.\\u201DThe pandemic has led to a steep increase in child poverty rates, food insecurity rates and unemployment, with Black and Latino families disproportionately experiencing economic hardship. From February to June 2020, the number of children in families with earnings below the poverty level, which is $26,500 for a family of four, rose by nearly 5 million. More than 40 percent of children now live in a household struggling to pay for basic expenses. And as many as 11 million children could be living in homes where they don\\u2019t have enough food.Food pantries and unemployment insurance application systems have crumbled under the sheer volume of demand. Families have struggled to get help for rent and utilities, often hitting a tangle of red tape, and despite a federal moratorium, evictions have continued.Covid-19 \\u201Cabsolutely ravaged communities,\\u201D said MJ Korpela, family services director at Jeremiah Program, a two-generation support program in Austin, Texas, and six other locations nationwide.Programs such as Jeremiah and Home of Hope aim to offer wide-reaching aid that addresses the causes of poverty, rather than offering piecemeal solutions for single issues. Jeremiah Program, almost entirely funded by donations from individuals and institutions, will offer more than 1,100 moms and children stable housing, mental health support, parenting education and help with higher education classes this year.Elements of a two-generation approach have been evident in some programs since the 1960s, such as through the federally funded Head Start program, which offers services and resources for parents of children who are enrolled in a Head Start classroom. Two-generation programs became more prominent in the 1980s and the 1990s and have relied mostly on philanthropic funding, although more federal funding has been made available in recent years.Research shows that two-generation approaches can improve the well-being of mothers and their children, leading to higher education attainment, jobs with livable wages and better academic performance for children. Parents are more likely to enter the workforce and retain stable employment when they have stable child care, something that is often offered by two-generation programs. And when caregivers are able to attain credentials or higher education degrees through two-generation programs, thus finding higher-paying jobs, it can have an impact on their children\\u2019s income down the road.\\u201CWhen families have access to resources, they\\u2019re going to be more able to start thinking about what\\u2019s the next step, what\\u2019s coming next, and be able to focus more on the future,\\u201D said Paola Silvestre, director of Family Pathways at United Way for Greater Austin, which runs several programs aimed at supporting low-income parents and their children. \\u201CIt\\u2019s really hard to focus when you\\u2019re thinking, \\u2018I don\\u2019t have food in my house, I don\\u2019t have a place to live.\\u2019\\u201DBut the coronavirus pandemic has pushed these small, already-overstretched programs to the limit as they\\u2019ve tried to meet the enormous demand of their communities. Many saw an increase in applications from families while at the same time, donations dropped and fundraising events that support these programs were canceled. Some two-generation programs, like Home of Hope, were only able to continue their work because they received federal funding through coronavirus relief packages.Korpela saw the pandemic as the ultimate test of the Jeremiah Program\\u2019s effectiveness: Could it help families withstand a global health crisis and massive recession?She believes the answer is a resounding \\u201Cyes.\\u201DKorpela said that in talking to moms in the program, she realized, \\u201CCovid hasn\\u2019t impacted them too much because they were so supported.\\u201D While there was some psychological impact from isolation, and many were also grappling with the nation\\u2019s racial reckoning, these families, for the most part, were able to rely on the program to help them meet their basic needs.\\u201CFor families in poverty, one thing can catapult a loss of everything,\\u201D she said. But Jeremiah Program \\u201Ckept that full momentum going \\u2026 and [families] didn\\u2019t fall back.\\u201DSydney Martens, a single mother of a 2-year-old, is working toward finishing her degree in criminal justice. She said that she hasn\\u2019t worried about paying for rent or child care because she\\u2019s been in the Jeremiah Program in Austin throughout. \\u201CBesides us being stuck in the house, we\\u2019ve had it pretty easy,\\u201D she said.At Home of Hope, which considers itself a \\u201Cnext step\\u201D toward independence, Pritchett found more than just housing. She doesn\\u2019t have to worry about meals or snacks. She and her daughter received a free room and a private bathroom. Each resident is assigned a case manager to meet with weekly. Mothers have customized \\u201Clife plans\\u201D to target their future goals and address emotional, physical and educational needs.The goal is to help the family get on a strong footing so there\\u2019s less chance they will backslide once they leave. \\u201CWe\\u2019re teaching moms to be independent,\\u201D said Maureen Kornowa, executive director of Home of Hope. \\u201CWe\\u2019re going to teach you how to navigate life.\\u201D (Home of Hope and Jeremiah Program serve only mothers and children; some other two-generation programs work with fathers as well.)With the help of her case manager, Pritchett is working on saving her money and budgeting so she will have a down payment on a house or a security deposit and rent for an apartment when she moves out by October; families can stay for up to a year. Her daughter attends frequent activities and programs on the campus, which Kornowa said are meant to provide children with a safe, nurturing environment where they can focus on being kids.\\u201CThe whole idea, the bottom line, is it\\u2019s a multigenerational approach to ending the cycle of homelessness,\\u201D Kornowa said. \\u201CYou keep that family unit together and teach mom to fish.\\u201DRelated: Homework in a McDonald\\u2019s parking lot: Inside one mother\\u2019s fight to help her kids get an education during coronavirusWithout the help of the shelter, Pritchett could have applied for decades-old federally funded programs that provide piecemeal support for families, like the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), unemployment insurance and food stamps. While many of these programs are proven to help families and lead to better academic achievement for children, they are administered through states and often fall short of reaching all families in need. Many have lengthy waitlists or cumbersome application processes.And forcing families with young children to wait for help can have a disastrous impact. Research shows poverty can cause trauma that affects the brain during the first few years of life when brain development is most rapid. This can affect emotional processing, judgment and academic achievement as children age.At the Jeremiah Program in Austin, this research is why the focus is on helping mothers and children before \\u201Cpoverty has taken its toll on development,\\u201D Korpela said.Mothers receive coaching while working on their educational and career goals. They get life skills and empowerment training, covering topics such as financial literacy and parenting, and explanations of the inherent racism in systems, including those that contribute to poverty \\u2014 all of which, research shows, can help people develop skills and mindsets that can disrupt poverty.One program piloted by the United Way for Greater Austin gives parents free tuition and a stipend to train for a skilled trade, such as plumbing or a health care job, like EKG technician. Parents receive a free laptop, transportation assistance and career coaching, and their kids are enrolled in high-quality child care.\\u201CMoney is not enough,\\u201D said Chastity Lord, president and CEO of Jeremiah Program. \\u201CPeople don\\u2019t live single-issue lives, because they don\\u2019t have a single-issue struggle.\\u201DLeaders of many of these programs say they see the success of their approach in how well families do after leaving. In a recent Jeremiah Program alumni survey, mothers said they had seen a 68 percent increase in their earnings, on average, since starting the program. Nearly 90 percent of children in the program\\u2019s child development centers perform above developmental benchmarks. The average annual income of graduates from the past five years is more than $47,000, slightly higher than the annual median income for families led by a single mother.At Home of Hope, 82 percent of mothers and children transition into stable housing. Kornowa said the rate of mothers who become homeless after leaving the program is low due to the program\\u2019s stringent expectations of moms, which include abiding by a curfew, finding employment, attending parenting programs and saving money. At the United Way for Greater Austin, almost 30 percent of parents or caregivers earned a high school diploma or equivalent credential while enrolled in one of the organization\\u2019s two-generation programs.But these initiatives can be costly to run and expand. Home of Hope, funded by private donations and fundraising events, spends more than $4,800 a month per family in its program. Jeremiah Program had more than $11 million in operating expenses in 2019, and the nonprofit will need an estimated $50.5 million to pay for a planned expansion that would help four times as many mothers and children over the next five years.Related: Homeless students set adrift by school closures face crisis after crisisOffering high-quality child care alone is expensive. Programs often cobble together funds from private foundations, fundraising events and the government. And programs must have flexible and highly trained staff members who can attend to families\\u2019 needs for support. That means hiring professionals who can offer everything from mental health support to parenting education classes. Many programs also rely on external partnerships, such as with local community colleges.Advocates say the challenges are worth it. When families have these types of extensive support systems in place, it can help them weather storms that might otherwise be disastrous.\\u201CAddressing just one barrier, when there are so many that are so intertwined, is just not a holistic approach and it\\u2019s just not a realistic approach,\\u201D Korpela said. \\u201CYou\\u2019re taking some of that burden off families to try to be piecing it together on their own.\\u201DWith the help of Home of Hope, Pritchett has started to plan for a more secure future.Since she moved in, she has saved 40 percent of every paycheck for future rent payments and found a new job at a warehouse that pays more than she was making testing routers. She\\u2019s had more visits with her son. Her daughter has flourished, too. She was recently accepted into her school district\\u2019s gifted program and, when asked, talks excitedly about the many activities available for kids at Home of Hope.But one of the biggest differences has been emotional, Pritchett said. She is less anxious and more patient, especially with her children. \\u201CI don\\u2019t have a lot of outside stressors anymore because I\\u2019m somewhere stable,\\u201D Pritchett said. \\u201CI\\u2019m just really happy that we found this place. It\\u2019s a lot less stress on me.\\u201D"},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Prince Philip laid to rest by Queen Elizabeth II, royal family","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/world\/prince-philip-s-funeral-royals-gather-scaled-back-event-n1264253","content":"WINDSOR, England \\u2014 Legend has it he was born on a kitchen table on the Greek island of Corfu almost a century ago. On Saturday, he was delivered to a royal vault on the grounds of Windsor Castle.Britain's royal family said farewell to Prince Philip, family patriarch and Queen Elizabeth II's husband of 73 years, who died last week, a few months short of his 100th birthday.Ahead of the funeral, riders from the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery made their way up the Long Walk toward Windsor Castle, and military personnel and royal guards all in ceremonial dress took up their positions in Windsor's Quadrangle beneath a blue sky.Rows of military marching musicians played pieces of music, including \\\"I Vow to Thee My Country\\\" and \\\"Jerusalem,\\\" after members of the royal family not in the procession departed for St. George\\u2019s Chapel.Waiting for him in the ancient chapel was the queen, dressed all in black and wearing a matching mask against the pandemic.The queen, 94, who has called her husband her \\\"strength and stay,\\\" sat alone and at a remove from the other attendees, who were limited to 30 and maintained social distancing in accordance with the country's Covid-19 rules.Her grandson Prince Harry also sat alone. It was his first public appearance with the royal family since he and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, gave a tell-all interview to the media mogul Oprah Winfrey in the United States last month.The Duke of Edinburgh \\u2014 the longest-serving consort of any British monarch \\u2014 was remembered for his dedication to the queen.\\u201CWe have been inspired by his unwavering loyalty to our queen, by his service to the nation and the Commonwealth, by his courage, fortitude and faith,\\u201D said the Rev. David Conner, dean of Windsor, who conducted the funeral service that Philip himself planned. \\u201COur lives have been enriched through the challenges that he has set us, the encouragement that he has given us, his kindness, humor and humanity.\\u201DHis coffin was draped with his personal flag, and placed on top was his sword, a naval cap, a flower wreath \\u2014 and a letter from his wife.The funeral service lasted less than an hour. After Philip's casket was lowered into the royal vault, his many titles were proclaimed and a lament was played by a pipe major of the Royal Regiment of Scotland.When it was over, the queen stood up and, walking slowly, left the chapel.His is not a state funeral, as Philip was not a monarch, but rather a ceremonial funeral akin to the burial of the queen mother in 2002.Still, hundreds assembled outside the castle despite officials asking crowds not to gather before the funeral. Mourners arrived carrying photos and paintings of Philip, and shop windows displayed depictions of the queen's husband.\\\"He has died the way he lived \\u2014 with no fuss or bother,\\\" Ailsa Anderson-Cole, a former press secretary to the queen, told NBC News on Saturday, referring to the scaled-backed funeral service. \\\"Prince Philip has probably got the kind of ceremony that he would have wanted.\\\"The ceremony, laced with personal touches, began with an eight-minute procession and was followed by a service in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle \\u2014 the location of Harry and Meghan's spring wedding just under three years ago.In contrast to that jubilant event, the funeral for the charismatic and at times cantankerous prince was somber and scaled down due, in part, to coronavirus restrictions.Ahead of the chapel service at 3 p.m. local time (10 a.m. ET), a national minute of silence was held.In a widely anticipated moment, Prince William and his brother, Harry, walked together behind their grandfather's coffin during the ceremonial procession, along with their father, Prince Charles, and a handful of royals \\u2014 none wearing military uniforms.Although William and Harry didn't walk side by side \\u2014 their cousin Peter Phillips between them \\u2014 the image conjured up memories of the pair as boys walking mournfully behind the coffin of their mother, Princess Diana, in 1997, accompanied by their grandfather.Meghan, pregnant with the couple's second child, remained in California.Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politicsDressed in dark suits and looking somber and reflective, the members of the royal family donned their masks as they entered the doors of the chapel.Protocol suggests that Harry, who undertook two tours in Afghanistan, can only wear a suit with medals at royal functions. But he lost his honorary military titles after deciding to step back as a senior working royal last year.Making the short journey from castle to chapel, Philip's coffin was transported in a purpose-built Land Rover that the duke began designing 18 years ago, according to palace officials. The specially adapted hearse was modified to a dark bronze green at his request, with final changes made in 2019.The vehicle was flanked by military pallbearers and parade bands in keeping with Philip's military affiliations.Philip lived a peripatetic youth after his father, Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, was banished and his family fled Greece. Philip joined Britain's Royal Navy where he excelled, serving in World War II, and married the then-Princess Elizabeth.After she became queen in 1952, he carved out a socially unusual role for the times, supporting his wife but always one step behind her \\u2014 in public at least.\\\"There was no precedent.

For many, though, the service will highlight his legacy of loyalty and service to the crown and efforts on behalf of the environment, among other work.In 2011, Philip reflected on his own unique role.\\\"I reckon I've done my bit,\\\" he said in an interview with the BBC to mark his 90th birthday.\\\"It's better to get out before you reach the sell-by date.\\\"Adela Suliman reported from Windsor, Saphora Smith reported from London and Corky Siemaszko reported from New York.Adela Suliman is a London-based reporter for NBC News Digital. Saphora Smith is a London-based reporter for NBC News Digital. Corky Siemaszko is a senior writer for NBC News Digital."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Czech Republic expels 18 Russian envoys, accuses Moscow over ammunition depot blast","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/world\/czech-republic-expels-18-russian-envoys-accuses-moscow-over-ammunition-n1264420","content":"PRAGUE \\u2014 The Czech Republic said on Sunday it had informed NATO and European Union allies about suspected Russian involvement in a 2014 ammunition depot explosion and the matter would be addressed at an E.U. foreign ministers' meeting on Monday.The central European country expelled 18 Russian embassy staff on Saturday over the issue and said investigations had linked Russian intelligence to the explosion, which killed two people.Russia's Interfax news agency cited Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the Russian upper house's international affairs committee, on Saturday as saying Prague's assertions were absurd and Russia's response should be proportionate.Meanwhile, another high-profile official, Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the State Duma's international affairs committee, said Saturday the grounds for the Czech move \\u201Cdo not stand up to criticism,\\u201D adding that the Czech Republic follows \\u201Cthe Russophobic course of the United States\\u201D by expelling Russian diplomats, Russian state news agency Tass reported.The expulsions and allegations come at a time of heightened Russian-Western tensions and have triggered the biggest dispute between the Czechs and Russia since the 1989 end of Communist rule, when Prague was under Moscow's domination for decades.On Sunday, the E.U.'s executive commission confirmed remarks by acting Czech Foreign Minister Jan Hamacek on Twitter that the dispute would be addressed during a previously schedule E.U. foreign ministers' video conference on Monday.Separately, Czech police said they were searching for two men in connection with serious criminal activity who were carrying Russian passports in the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, and that the men were in the country in the days leading up to the 2014 explosion.Those were the aliases used by two Russian military intelligence (GRU) officers who British prosecutors charged with the attempted poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with the nerve agent Novichok in the English city of Salisbury in 2018.Moscow has denied involvement in that incident.The United States and Britain said they stood in full solidarity with the Czech Republic in the dispute with Russia.A statement by the U.S. Embassy in Prague said on Saturday Washington \\\"stands with its steadfast ally, the Czech Republic.

It is bigger than Chicago (2.7 million) and equivalent to Philadelphia and Dallas combined.And the true number is believed to be significantly higher because of possible government concealment and the many cases overlooked in the early stages of the outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.When the world back in January passed the bleak threshold of 2 million deaths, immunization drives had just started in Europe and the United States. Today, they are underway in more than 190 countries, though progress in bringing the virus under control varies widely.While the campaigns in the U.S. and Britain have hit their stride and people and businesses there are beginning to contemplate life after the pandemic, other places, mostly poorer countries but some rich ones as well, are lagging behind in putting shots in arms and have imposed new lockdowns and other restrictions as virus cases soar.Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakWorldwide, deaths are on the rise again, running at around 12,000 per day on average, and new cases are climbing too, eclipsing 700,000 a day.\\u201CThis is not the situation we want to be in 16 months into a pandemic, where we have proven control measures,\\u201D said Maria Van Kerkhove, one of the World Health Organization\\u2019s leaders on Covid-19.In Brazil, where deaths are running at about 3,000 per day, accounting for one-quarter of the lives lost worldwide in recent weeks, the crisis has been likened to a \\u201Craging inferno\\u201D by one WHO official. A more contagious variant of the virus has been rampaging across the country.As cases surge, hospitals are running out of critical sedatives. As a result, there have been reports of some doctors diluting what supplies remain and even tying patients to their beds while breathing tubes are pushed down their throats.The slow vaccine rollout has crushed Brazilians\\u2019 pride in their own history of carrying out huge immunization campaigns that were the envy of the developing world.Taking cues from President Jair Bolsonaro, who has likened the virus to little more than a flu, his Health Ministry for months bet big on a single vaccine, ignoring other producers.

In a surge driven by variants of the virus, India saw over 180,000 new infections in one 24-hour span during the past week, bringing the total number of cases to over 13.9 million.The challenges facing India reverberate beyond its borders since the country is the biggest supplier of shots to COVAX, the U.N.-sponsored program to distribute vaccines to poorer parts of the world. Last month, India said it would suspend vaccine exports until the virus\\u2019s spread inside the country slows.Globally, about 87 percent of the 700 million doses dispensed have been given out in rich countries. While 1 in 4 people in wealthy nations have received a vaccine, in poor countries the figure is 1 in more than 500.In recent days, the U.S. and some European countries put the use of Johnson & Johnson\\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine on hold while authorities investigate extremely rare but dangerous blood clots.

What should Biden do?","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/politics\/national-security\/north-korea-has-more-nuclear-weapons-ever-what-should-biden-n1263983","content":"WASHINGTON \\u2014 Ever since North Korea began building nuclear weapons in the 1990s, the policy of the United States has been clear: Give up those bombs or face international isolation.After three decades of sanctions, threats of force and diplomacy \\u2014 including President Trump's theatrical summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \\u2014 North Korea now has more nuclear weapons than ever, plus ballistic missiles that intelligence officials say could deliver a warhead to the U.S. And because of the global pandemic, the hermit kingdom has shuttered its borders, halting imports of food and medicine in a way more punishing than international sanctions could ever be.That dangerous security threat is now in President Joe Biden's lap, and his administration is expected to announce the results of a policy review on North Korea soon. Experts and people briefed on it say they expect that while Biden will not formally abandon the goal of \\\"total denuclearization,\\\" he will attempt to achieve the more limited aim of diminishing North Korea's nuclear threat, while at the same time seeking to lower the visibility of a thorny foreign policy problem that has no neat solution.\\\"Realistically speaking, the administration's North Korea strategy will probably be open to (an) approach in which North Korea's capabilities are capped or limited,\\\" Eric Brewer, who worked on North Korea policy at the National Security Council in the Obama administration, told NBC News. \\\"Even if denuclearization remains a component of the strategy, I find it hard to believe they wouldn't be open to more interim solutions that reduce the threat.\\\"The administration also plans to seek to reinvigorate the so-called trilateral relationship between the U.S., South Korea and Japan, according to a former Trump administration official who has been consulted.Whether there are direct talks with the North Koreans depends on the North's behavior, that person said.While denuclearization would remain a long-term goal, the U.S. could try to persuade North Korea to agree to restrictions on its delivery systems for nuclear weapons in return for substantial relief from economic sanctions, Brewer said. If unchecked, those delivery systems, including solid-fuel missiles, ICBM warheads and multiple re-entry vehicles, could allow North Korea to launch attacks faster and potentially evade U.S. countermeasures.Brewer recently co-authored an article in Foreign Affairs with Sue Mi-Terry, who worked on the National Intelligence Council under President Obama and served as a CIA analyst, arguing for a \\\"realistic bargain\\\" with North Korea.The two, who are both now senior fellows at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote that the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated the regime's economic woes, and could mean North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would be open to cutting a deal.\\\"Kim has not been easily swayed by economic pressure in the past,\\\" they wrote, but it is possible he is desperate enough for sanctions relief \\u2014 and confident enough in his existing nuclear and missile capabilities \\u2014 that he would trade some limits on his weapons programs for a significant reduction in sanctions.\\\"In an interview, Terry told NBC News, \\\"Right now, we are looking to re-engage with North Korea in some form.\\\"Victor Cha, who oversaw Korea policy in the George W. Bush administration, agreed.He noted that North Korea has shut down its borders completely in an effort to tamp down the spread of Covid-19, including imports of food and medicine from China. In so doing, it has imposed a blockade on itself more draconian than sanctions, which don't usually cover humanitarian aid.\\\"This is about as maximum as the sanctions can be and it's all self-imposed,\\\" said Cha, who said Biden may want to offer pandemic-related aid as a gesture of goodwill.Even with a less ambitious objective, arms control negotiations with North Korea would be \\\"really, really hard,\\\" Brewer said, particularly because Pyongyang has tended to fiercely resist any inspection or verification mechanisms. And any restrictions on the North's weapons systems would have to be verified on the ground, he said, not just via U.S. intelligence surveillance.Intelligence officials say North Korea has no intention of giving up its nuclear weapons, leaving the Biden administration faced with a series of unpalatable options. They range from attempting to restart talks that have a history of failure to a military strike that could have disastrous repercussions.\\\"North Korea will be a WMD threat for the foreseeable future, because [Kim Jong Un] remains strongly committed to the country's nuclear weapons, the country is actively engaged in ballistic missile research and development, and Pyongyang's (chemical and biological) efforts persist,\\\" says an unclassified intelligence assessment released Tuesday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.After two failed presidential summits with Trump, North Korea has greeted the incoming Biden team with a series of provocations, including harsh rhetoric and a short-range missile test. But so far, the regime has not taken the far more provocative steps of testing a long-range missile or a nuclear weapon, both of which it has done previously.There is always a chance, however, that Biden's bid for negotiations fails, and North Korea falls back on its pattern of aggressive and attention-seeking behavior, including threatening its neighbors and testing dangerous weapons. If that happens, the only real option short of war \\u2014 covert CIA operations aside \\u2014 is more economic sanctions, experts say.Critics point out that years of sanctions of various kinds have failed to convince the North to denuclearize. But in fact, observers say, the U.S. has never mounted the sort of sustained and biting sanctions campaign against North Korea that the Obama administration used to push Iran to bargain, resulting in a 2015 nuclear agreement from which Trump withdrew, but which Biden is seeking to restore.\\\"It took three years of really hard sanctions for Iran to come to the negotiating table,\\\" Terry said.Those sanctions included penalties against European and other banks accused of violating the law by doing business with Iran. So far, no administration has been willing to levy similar \\\"secondary sanctions\\\" against Chinese banks that keep North Korea afloat.\\\"The U.S. imposed $8 billion to $9 billion in fines on U.K. and French banks for money laundering for Iran, but $0 in fines on Chinese banks for money laundering for North Korea,\\\" said Bruce Klingner, a former CIA analyst and Korea expert at the Heritage Foundation.Klingner and other North Korea experts cite a single telling exception to that rule: An action against an obscure bank in Macau that they say could be a blueprint for putting the squeeze on North Korea.The Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Banco Delta Asia in 2005, accusing it of laundering money for the North Korean regime. Soon, more than two dozen financial institutions had pulled back from doing business with North Korea, imperiling its finances. Even many top U.S. officials were surprised at how hard the sanctions had bitten.\\\"You Americans finally have found a way to hurt us,\\\" Cha, then the point person on Korea policy, recalls an inebriated North Korean diplomat mumbling during a round of toasts at a negotiation.But two years after the sanctions on the bank were imposed \\u2014 including the freezing of $25 million in North Korean assets \\u2014 the U.S. gave the money back, paving the way for North Korea to re-enter the international banking system. It was part of a deal that was supposed to result in the unwinding of North Korea's nuclear weapons program.That didn't happen, of course, yet no similar sanctions have been levied since.Joshua Stanton, who runs the blog OneFreeKorea and is one of the foremost experts on North Korea sanctions, argues that United Nations reports on sanctions compliance regularly provide evidence that could be used to penalize companies, but the U.S. has rarely acted on that material.\\\"Why are we more tolerant of Chinese banks violating North Korea sanctions than Barack Obama was of European banks that violated Iran sanctions?\\\" asked Stanton.One reason, Cha and others say, is because the U.S. has long sought China's help in pressuring North Korea.\\\"We've always been careful about going after Chinese,\\\" Cha said. \\\"It's a balancing act \\u2014 there's a desire to have Chinese cooperation in the negotiations.\\\"In order for diplomacy to work, it must be backed by a credible threat of force, the former Trump administration official and other experts say.\\\"The only way to get the North to agree to anything is sanctions plus a military threat, and diplomatic pressure,\\\" the former official said.In response to questions from NBC News, a spokesperson for the National Security Council said, \\\"The North Korea review is in its final stages and we're not going to get ahead of that.\\\"Ken Dilanian is a correspondent covering intelligence and national security for the NBC News Investigative Unit.Carol E.

And I'm going to keep walking.","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/think\/opinion\/covid-walks-kept-angry-caffeine-addict-sane-i-m-going-ncna1263386","content":"I never thought I'd miss working in an office. But then the pandemic sent me, like so many other office workers, into work-from-home purgatory in March 2020.As I was locked down \\u2014 literally \\u2014 in my bedroom-turned-office-turned-break room, suddenly the impetus to move, whether my legs, my eyes or my perspective, evaporated. In a one-bedroom apartment that then became occupied 24\\\/7 by two humans and endless conference calls, the bathroom was suddenly only four steps away; the coffee machine was five. Job and life distinctions evaporated.My workday expanded. My world narrowed. I stopped moving. And then I started walking.In the before times, the idea of going for a walk during the workday was an aspirational nonstarter. Who had the time? But Covid-19 highlighted for me how the rhythms and necessities of office life had once paradoxically required me to move around \\u2014 to the kitchen for water, down the hall to the bathroom, up two flights of stairs to a conference room, down and around the block for lunch.Meanwhile, my workday expanded. My world narrowed. I stopped moving. And then I started walking.With each first step, I can feel my shoulders ratchet down from their now semi-permanent home just below my jaw line. I breathe in the familiar, somewhat fresh, scent of outside. With my friends Grace (Potter) and Miranda (Lambert) and Brandi (Carlile), I wander, letting my eyes focus on new-to-me objects not illuminated by an LED screen, on discarded White Castle cartons (Do I want a hamburger for dinner?) and tacky basement apartment light fixtures (Did that guy just totally catch me creeping?).The randomness is blessedly the point. I swear I can feel my neurons regenerating. I let my mind shake itself free from the restrictions of calendar updates and deadlines and KPIs and grammar. I allow myself to lose focus.I wouldn't call myself a good walker, to be clear. I have one colleague who for several months last year routinely walked 10 or more miles at a stretch; that's not me, and it's probably never going to be me.In the winter, I walked circles around my Brooklyn block. This occurred mostly in the darkening late afternoon, my race against the sun a comically futile exercise. I walked, eyes watering, in the freezing cold. I walked into the wind, stupidly; I walked through the snow. It hasn't always been fun, but I've never returned home regretful.As we contemplate a pinprick of light at the end of the tunnel, I hope I keep taking these random, short walks. No goal or destination needed.I'm 33 years old with a good, and hopefully secure, job that I enjoy. I'm also a caffeine addict with raging imposter syndrome and a seeming unwillingness to create sane work-life boundaries. I don't like yoga or meditation and have found my tolerance for alcohol on school nights has, depressingly, decreased precipitously as I've gotten older.And so I walk. And as we contemplate what hope feels like, I plan to continue taking these random, short walks. No goal or destination needed.Of course, the health benefits of walking are well studied and well publicized. Studies have shown a whole host of benefits, from cardiovascular health to increased creativity and weight loss. What I think is perhaps slightly less well known is how little you have to walk to reap some of those benefits. I don't have time \\u2014 or, at least, I tell myself that I don't have time \\u2014 to walk briskly for 45 minutes in the middle of the day. But just 12 or 15 minutes of walking can boost your mood. And the benefits are even better if you walk around thinking nice thoughts about strangers, according to these saintly Iowa State psychologists.I may not be walking around silently wishing passersby well, but walking has given me something intangible, ephemeral and surprisingly precious. And, as shown in some of those aforementioned studies, walking is actually great for productivity and creativity. So sometimes I do, with mild guilt, use walks to work; stepping out of my bedroom-box has helped me solve problems and brainstorm solutions.But that's not why I want to keep walking, even after life goes back to whatever semblance of normal awaits.Last week, I got my first Covid-19 vaccination shot. (The impact of its scientific mini-miracle was blunted only slightly by my lifelong and increasingly embarrassing needle phobia.) A few days later, I found a 20-minute hole in my calendar just past the time when most people have finished lunch. I put on Grace Potter's \\\"Daylight\\\" \\u2014 a personal pandemic favorite \\u2014 and turned the volume up.\\\"Bathe me in your warm glow,\\\" she sang. \\\"Show me what I've always known, show me that I'm not alone.\\\"I watched a blond dog in tiny little booties pick its way across the sidewalk. I wondered whether I should break my diet and get ice cream later. I felt the breeze in my mini-mullet and remembered how badly I needed a haircut. I blessedly lost focus. I walked toward the sun.Other essays from our project on what we should keep post-pandemic:Meredith Bennett-Smith is the managing editor of MSNBC."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"I moved back home during the Covid pandemic.

In early 2019, even when I helped them renovate it so my father, who was losing mobility, could navigate it more freely \\u2014 though I struggled to afford it \\u2014 I still had no intention of making their home mine, too. When my father then died in June 2019, despite not wanting to leave my mother living up there all by herself, I couldn't imagine moving in.And even when Ma was diagnosed with breast cancer in late 2019, and I started splitting my weeks between my overpriced studio apartment in Brooklyn and the house upstate (on which I was paying most of the bills) in order to help manage her care, I never considered giving up my city life to move to the suburbs. Absolutely not!What spells failure more than a single woman in her 40s moving in with her mother near the small town she grew up in?Then the pandemic hit.After a three-week quarantine \\u2014 yes, we knew the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only recommended two \\u2014 I went home to stay with Ma.Suddenly, all the myths I had bought into about what success looks like and how we were supposed to live as adults began to crumble. My mother was going through her final round of chemo, the last she needed to save her life, and yet I couldn't be there because she was too immunocompromised for me to go back and forth and risk exposing her to Covid-19.So I waited in my practically dorm-room-sized studio in downtown Brooklyn afraid to even go in the elevator, let alone outside, trying to decide what to do next.Like a lot of people in my position, I realized that, if I couldn\\u2019t leave it, my shoebox of an apartment was not designed to be a full-time home.And my mom needed me: She couldn\\u2019t go to the grocery store or the pharmacy. She couldn\\u2019t physically deal with people coming to the door to make deliveries. She needed help getting to her appointments. That, after all, was why I'd been splitting my time between my place and hers to begin with.So after a three-week quarantine \\u2014 yes, we knew the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only recommended two, but tests were hard to come by then \\u2014 I went home to stay with Ma.Suddenly, all the myths I had bought into about what success looks like and how we were supposed to live as adults began to crumble.The plan was to stay for a month at first \\u2014 until things \\u201Cgot back to normal.\\u201D But, of course, nothing went back to normal after a month. And our relationship changed: The trauma of losing my father the year before coupled with first her cancer and then the possibility of her navigating a different deadly disease alone quieted my perceived need to live independent of her. I\\u2019d already lost one parent; I wasn\\u2019t ready to face the potential loss of another.Before I knew it, one month led to five. Somehow, rather than paying for a house I'd never live in, I was paying for rent in a place I was terrified to go near. I moved my stuff out of my studio and ended my lease.In months that I was living with Ma \\u2014 upstate and outside of the city \\u2014 something else had happened, too. My body changed: Long riddled with anxiety issues, I was calmer, more in touch with nature, eating better and feeling less under attack from the day-to-day challenges of living in New York City in a body that wasn't white, thin or young.I spent more time cooking and even learned some of her recipes, something I'd previously rejected as too domestic for me. We were able to heal from the loss of my father and face the unending global devastation together. We fought and drew new boundaries; we learned more about one another and our motivations as adults, not child and mom. We talked openly about mental health and spirituality. It was not all roses; we are still mother and daughter, after all.And we are both aware this is temporary \\u2014 which, somehow, makes both of us sad.But as we consider the possibility of going back to the separate lives we once knew, I am still deeply changed by this time living with her and in nature (and with our five cats). I can\\u2019t imagine having lived through this any other way.Perhaps some people still see moving home as a regression \\u2014 maybe our endless quest to move ahead and \\u201Cmake it\\u201D will survive this pandemic intact \\u2014 but it gave me stability during an unprecedented trauma.

The American dining experience had long been a study in comfort and entertainment more than mere nourishment and socialization.It's part of a larger trend; as a society we\\u2019ve become indoor cats. A 2019 study by the Outdoor Foundation found that nearly half of all Americans do not participate in any outdoor recreation, while only 17.9 percent even go outside at least once a week.Maybe we needed to learn to suffer a bit when it comes to \\\"dining out.\\\"Indoor dining restrictions at the start of the pandemic led to the near collapse of the restaurant industry as a whole, from lags in revenue to layoffs and the shuttering of many establishments \\u2014 as many as 17 percent of all restaurants. (Either restaurants were not as quick to pivot to take-out and our \\u201Cnew normal\\u201D for dining out as we think \\u2014 or perhaps it was us that couldn\\u2019t adapt.)It seems that we just do not like to be uncomfortable or inconvenienced.The romance and appeal of outdoor dining still seems to apply only to fair-weather days here in the U.S.The ideal of discomfort when it comes to eating is not inherently foreign to Americans: We have food festivals dedicated to spicy foods and competitive eating events; we eat outdoors at concerts and fairs and ball games. But the willingness to eat al fresco has not permeated the menued restaurants, let alone fine dining \\u2014 and, amid the pandemic, it caused our restaurants to suffer.Indoor seating restrictions in restaurants helped curb the spread of the virus. Cities across the country relaxed outdoor drinking and dining regulations to allow makeshift patio spaces. Sidewalks, parking lots and even street parking spaces became extensions of restaurants' dining rooms; some municipalities barricaded entire blocks to allow for socially distanced gathering spaces. Restaurants with any room to grow poured money into decks, patios and pea-gravel picnic areas.There was a run on patio heaters, fire pits, portable gazebos and sailcloth-style tents to keep diners safe from the elements. Some restaurants got innovative, offering an indoor-outdoor hybrid approach through plastic domes akin to igloos or modified greenhouses, even though studies showed that viruses could breed in those settings as easily as in regular indoor dining.After a year, all of the innovation does not appear to have changed our collective perspective on going out to eat: More attention is placed on reopening restaurants at their pre-COVID capacities than on reopening public schools.Maybe we needed to learn to suffer a bit when it comes to \\\"dining out.\\\"The romance and appeal of outdoor dining still seems to apply only to fair-weather days here in the U.S. The biergartens of Germany, the cafés of France and al fresco tables in Italy and Spain are year-round experiences, offered regardless of a chill or some drizzle. Sidewalk dining in the Caribbean and South America is intrinsic to food culture there as a whole, much like it is in some Asian countries.Americans are softer, less hardy that way.One of the few dining sectors to benefit from the pandemic was food trucks, after some restaurateurs chose to go entirely mobile and others added a truck or cart to complement existing businesses. Both helped to grow food trucks into a $2.7 billion industry, according to the industry publication Food Truck Operator.Regardless, the long-term success of outdoor dining is less about what a restaurant can do and more about the mentality of diners. Saving restaurants requires more than government money; it requires a willingness for governments to relax the over-regulation of outdoor dining and for the rest of us to embrace all-season dining out.As the saying goes, there is no bad weather, only the wrong footwear. Maybe there are no bad dining conditions then, only our inability to dress appropriately for the season at hand.Other essays from our project on what we should keep post-pandemic:Deanna Fox is a food and agriculture journalist."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Social distancing during Covid means no hugs. My personal space finally feels respected.","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/think\/opinion\/social-distancing-during-covid-means-no-hugs-my-personal-space-ncna1263554","content":"I was in my 20s when I taught myself how to hug. Warm and consistent physical affection wasn\\u2019t a cornerstone of my upbringing. I remember watching other little girls hug each other at the bus stop or in the school yard, and feeling alienated from displays of affection that seemed to come so easily to others.During particularly vulnerable stretches of childhood, watching others participate in this social convention left me feeling anxious. I\\u2019m now an adult who finds the concept of casual touch, such as hugging and shaking hands, odd and uncomfortable.Watching me move in for a hug is like watching two people attempt a high-five only to sail past each other, their awkwardness on parade. When someone catches me off guard while swooping in enthusiastically for an embrace, I seem as affectionate as a tree limb. And sometimes I\\u2019ll hug too tightly, my meter for these things being completely off kilter.The same goes with handshakes. Growing up, I\\u2019d always been told that my grip was too weak and hesitant. I was advised by a college instructor to apply some confidence and assert myself. When I put his instructions to use at the end of my first big job interview, my prospective employer responded with a loud \\u201COw!\\u201D and was left wringing her wrist as though she\\u2019d shaken it loose from an alligator. (I got the job, but we never shook hands again.)Since last year, though, the pandemic has unshackled me from the casual touches that define interpersonal communication for most people. I notice this freedom most when I run into friends and colleagues in public spaces. With our safety reliant on keeping a physical distance, my anxieties about touch are no longer on my mind. Hugging and casual contact, for the time being, remain socially unacceptable, so I can finally relax.The truth is that not everyone wants a hug. Yes, hugs can certainly be lovely. But respect for physical boundaries is a basic human right, and the awareness of them that the pandemic has raised shouldn\\u2019t be discarded once it\\u2019s over. Post-quarantine, our sensibility to physical space and keeping our distance should remain.After all, our perspectives on personal space are cultural, according to studies conducted across the past decade. Furthermore, as pointed out by Suzanne Degges-White, an expert in counseling and counselor education at Northern Illinois University, there are a number of reasons why a person might experience severe aversion to being touched, often stemming from upbringing. \\u201COur tendency to engage in physical touch\\u2014 whether hugging, a pat on the back or linking arms with a friend \\u2014 is often a product of our early childhood experiences,\\u201D she says.It certainly was for me. I remember the first time I hugged another child in front of my mother: I was in the eighth grade, and we ran into one of my schoolmates on a walk. I hadn\\u2019t seen him in several days, and he roller-skated up to me and wrapped his arms around me in a bear hug. When he skated away, my mother said with contempt, \\u201CWhat\\u2019s with the hugging?\\u201D Her reaction haunted me for years to come.Much earlier on, I had a grandfather with a particularly peculiar way of saying hello and goodbye. When I\\u2019d lean in for a kiss, he\\u2019d bite my nose. I can still feel his scratchy mustache stinging my skin. He got a kick out of my reaction (typically, to burst into tears). It\\u2019s hard not to be leery of touch when that\\u2019s how you were introduced to it.For others, aversion to touch might be rooted in social anxiety, low self-esteem, body issues, fear and trauma. For them, the physical distance requirements brought about by the pandemic came as a welcome relief. They\\u2019re no longer awkwardly submitting to social conventions that make them uncomfortable for the sake of making others happy.Whatever the reasons for a person\\u2019s lack of ease with physical touch, they all should be respected \\u2014 and it shouldn\\u2019t take a pandemic to offer basic consideration for the personal histories that people carry over into their interactions with others.I probably sound like an antisocial curmudgeon. Please trust that I\\u2019m not. It\\u2019s simply that casual touch is not likely to ever come naturally to me. I\\u2019m saddened, sometimes, when I think about the reasons for that, but the research shows that I\\u2019m far from alone in my discomfort, which is why many of us welcome the idea that the pandemic may have brought an end to displays of physical affection between friends \\u2014 and, more importantly, work colleagues and other acquaintance-level associates.While I long for the day that the pandemic will disappear like a thief into the night, I fervently hope that this deeper respect for physical boundaries stays with us.Other essays from our project on what we should keep post-pandemic:Christina Wyman is an adjunct professor of curriculum, instruction and teacher education at Michigan State University.

But as those who could do so suddenly retreated to home offices (or vacation homes), it became painfully apparent how much our society depends on the people who wouldn't have been able to just stay safe at home, even if they wanted to.Health care workers and first responders rightly got their due, but so did other hospital workers: the folks who mopped the floors, did the laundry and handled the bodies while doctors and nurses frantically tried to stem the tide of death. City dwellers rallied around sanitation workers and transit workers and helped amplify their demands for proper protective equipment and wages; restaurant staffers and delivery workers kept people's bellies full and their cupboards stocked and ensured that the more vulnerable members of our communities could stay out of harm's way.Farmworkers and meatpacking plant employees risked it all to prevent major disruptions in the food supply chain, and grocery store workers stood on the front lines to deliver that food into panicked, waiting hands. Teachers struggled to keep their students and themselves safe, an impossible puzzle that they have thrown their hearts into solving. Warehouse workers \\u2014 particularly those at e-commerce behemoths like Amazon, Target and Walmart \\u2014 picked and packed millions of orders of necessities and depression buys alike, and utility workers across the country kept the lights on.Now, a year into the pandemic, over a half-million people are dead; few of them were government officials or the wealthy elite, but a great and terrible number of them spent their final season on Earth engaged in the very essential work that turned them into heroes \\u2014 but ended up costing them their lives.While the applause has died down and the signs have wilted in the early spring rain, we will remember that phrase \\u2014 \\\"essential worker\\\" \\u2014 and the knowledge of who exactly kept the world turning while the government twiddled its thumbs and the superrich raked in record profits.Those who were already suffering felt the knife twist deepest, and even many of those who started out on stable ground had their lives collapse around them. While grocery store workers were dying, tech moguls Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk made billions; when transit workers were saying goodbye to their colleagues, the former president was golfing, his veins pumped full of exclusive treatments.There is no going back now, and a new wave of labor activism and working class resistance not only is inevitable; it is already happening.A necessary class consciousness has arisen in this country's essential workforce, and the explosion in new organizing and labor actions is an excellent sign of potential victories. Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, are in the midst of a vote to form the company's first union, which could have major ripple effects on the company's other U.S. facilities. Teachers across the country are striking to protect their students and open schools safety. Unionized grocery store workers have forced major supermarket chains to provide more hazard pay. Coal miners and graduate student workers are threatening to strike over wages and safety \\u2014 and these are only a few examples.On a federal level, the new administration has taken a decidedly pro-labor stance, and the Covid-19 relief bill offered financial support to millions of workers (despite its shameful failure to include a $15 minimum wage hike), while with the potential passage of the PRO Act, labor is in a decent position to make real material gains. Things still aren't great, but they're an awful lot better than they were this time last year.The pinprick of light at the end of this dark tunnel is finally coming into view, and it will hopefully bring a new era of working-class resistance along with it. Their work was always essential, but now, it is impossible to ignore.Other essays from our project on what we should keep post-pandemic:Kim Kelly is a freelance journalist, organizer and author based in Philadelphia.

Dontarius Long and Joel Brewer were each charged with two counts of murder, two counts of possession of a firearm by a felon, one count of robbery with a dangerous weapon and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon.Following the announcement, Lt. Bryan Crum said during a Friday news conference the department doesn\\u2019t believe \\u201Cthere\\u2019s any further risk to public safety.\\u201D\\u201CI can tell you that our investigation has advanced to the point that I feel confident in telling you there is no one else at large that was a part of this,\\u201D he said.Investigators are still looking into the suspects\\u2019 alleged motives, Crum said, and they\\u2019re working with the FBI to determine whether the killings could be considered hate crimes.\\u201CIf hate crime charges are appropriate, we will absolutely pursue those,\\u201D he said.Peterson and Fennell are among 15 transgender people killed so far in 2021, though that number could be higher because police often deadname and misgender them \\u2014 use a trans person\\u2019s name and pronouns assigned at birth \\u2014 in reports about their deaths. So far, nine of the known trans victims are Black trans women.Prior to the arrests, advocates in Charlotte said Black trans women were scared.\\u201CMany of them use hotels as their primary form of housing, and they don't feel safe to be there right now,\\u201D Ash Williams, a trans organizer in Charlotte, said. \\u201CSo, many of us are moving up to try to raise funds for safer, nonhotel housing for the Black trans women that live in Charlotte.\\u201DBut even after the arrests, Williams said trans people in Charlotte don\\u2019t feel safer, because police \\u201Ccriminalize\\u201D Black trans sex workers.\\u201CWe keep us safe,\\u201D he said. \\u201CThe police do not keep us safe \\u2014 they made that clear last week when they deadnamed and misgendered Jaida, so we don't give a f--- about what the police are talking about.\\u201DIn a statement to NBC News, Tufano said \\\"Community members should have an expectation to live and work without the fear of violence.\\\"He added \\\"Because of the tireless work of members of the CMPD, two dangerous people can no longer prey on vulnerable members of our community.

That is the question at the heart of Japanese director Ryuichi Hiroki\\u2019s new psychological thriller, \\u201CRide or Die,\\u201D which premiered on Netflix on Thursday.Based on Ching Nakamura\\u2019s popular graphic novel series, or manga, \\u201CGunjō,\\u201D the film tells the stirring story of Rei Nagasawa (Kiko Mizuhara) and Nanae Shinoda (Honami Sato), two Japanese women who struggle with their conflicting feelings for each other.When Rei, a lesbian in her 20s, receives an unexpected call from Nanae, the girl she was in love with during high school, she drops everything to go see her for the first time in a decade. But when she discovers that Nanae is trapped in a physically abusive marriage, Rei decides to take matters into her own hands. Without giving her actions a second thought, Rei seduces and kills Nanae\\u2019s husband in an attempt to protect her and to prove her love, which sets off a meandering series of events that bring the two women closer than ever before.Since \\u201CGunjō\\u201D started to circulate in 2007, numerous filmmakers have attempted to adapt the manga for the big screen, but most of them have struggled to capture the intense visual language of Nakamura\\u2019s original work, which spans 35 chapters and includes some very graphic depictions of sex and violence. The new adaptation eventually came to fruition under the direction of Hiroki, who is known for his intense and painful romance films, and was written by Nami Kikkawa.Sato, 31, said she is a \\u201Chuge fan of Ching Nakamura\\u2019s work\\u201D and was familiar with \\u201CGunjō\\u201D before being offered the role of Nanae.\\u201CWhen they offered me this project, I felt like it was a dream,\\u201D Sato told NBC News in a joint interview with Kiko Mizuhara, using an interpreter. \\u201CI did have apprehensions as to whether or not we could reconstruct what was in the manga as a film, [because] a manga is a manga and films are films. They\\u2019re different mediums. But reading the script, I felt that we were able to make [and honor] \\u2018Gunjō,\\u2019 and that was something very important to me.\\u201D\\u201CRei and Nanae\\u2019s relationship and dynamic actually build up and grow little-by-little, and you see that reflected on the screen.\\u201DHonami SatoMizuhara, by contrast, was not as familiar with the original source material. But she said when she read it for the first time, she immediately knew that she wanted to bring the same \\u201Cenergy, strength and intensity\\u201D to her deeply nuanced portrayal of Rei, even if she knew that it would be \\u201Ca daily struggle\\u201D to go through the same emotions that Rei experiences in the film.\\u201CThe film, I think, stands on its own from the manga, but I also wanted to make sure that those things were reflected,\\u201D Mizuhara, 30, said.Filmed last summer in various locations across Japan during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, \\u201CRide or Die\\u201D breaks a number of conventions in the studio-dominated Japanese entertainment industry. In the pre-production phase, Kikkawa got permission to make a number of changes that deviate from the original manga series, including turning this iteration into a road movie, giving the protagonists proper names, and changing the Japanese title to \\u201CKanojo\\u201D (which means \\u201Cshe\\u201D or \\u201Cgirlfriend\\u201D). Hiroki also decided to shoot the film chronologically \\u2014 another rarity in Japanese cinema \\u2014 which allowed Mizuhara and Sato to evolve with their respective characters.\\u201CThe character I play, Nanae, has no family, has no friends, and her husband is very violent towards her,\\u201D Sato explained. \\u201CShe doesn\\u2019t have anybody who she can really speak her truth with, and Rei is somebody that knows her vulnerable side as well. They have a past where Rei once helped her, and she\\u2019s always been a special person for Nanae. When Nanae calls Rei at the hotel after 10 years, Rei is the one who she feels like she wants to speak with, for better or for worse. The story starts from there, but everything really started from there for [Mizuhara and I], too. For all of the scenes, I was able to be really emotionally spontaneous, and everything really came from the evolution of the scenes.\\u201DAnd because the film progresses chronologically, Sato said \\u201CRei and Nanae\\u2019s relationship and dynamic actually build up and grow little-by-little, and you see that reflected on the screen.\\u201DMizuhara said she and Sato were \\u201Cinseparable like the characters\\u201D while filming.\\u201CWe were in a state where it was like, \\u2018I need you. Otherwise, I won\\u2019t be able to do this,\\u2019\\u201D she revealed. \\u201CWe were truly supporting each other, and even when the cameras were not rolling, we would hold hands, and we would be next to each other. Before a take, we would embrace, and we were able to really want to be together, physically and emotionally. The experience of being part of this film was really to live the characters, and that was an amazing feeling.\\u201D\\u201CI think I was able to do that because Honami is somebody who doesn\\u2019t build walls. She\\u2019s really, really open, and even from rehearsals, we were able to give our characters our all without building up any walls, and that was really special. I\\u2019ve never experienced anything like that,\\u201D added Mizuhara, who is best known internationally for her appearances in the special \\u201CWe\\u2019re in Japan!\\u201D season of \\u201CQueer Eye.\\u201DIn order to capture the spirit of the manga series, the film features two extremely graphic scenes: the first being Rei\\u2019s bloody killing of Nanae\\u2019s husband, and the second a climactic eight-minute sex scene between Rei and Nanae. In an interview with Netflix that was provided to the media, Hiroki said, \\u201COne of the reasons this work was not adapted for film for so long was that it was difficult to cast. There are simply few accomplished actresses willing to perform nude scenes.\\u201D Given the more conservative history of Japanese cinema, \\u201CRide or Die'' is a far cry from the stereotypical LGBTQ films that have graced the big screen in the past.To prepare for the more intimate scenes of the shoot, the production team decided to hire an intimacy coordinator, a person who works on film and television sets to choreograph sex scenes between actors. Mizuhara revealed that, after hearing from other acting friends who work on HBO productions in America, she was actually the one who suggested the addition of an intimacy coordinator \\u2014 a job that, in all honesty, really intrigued her.The intimacy coordinator \\u201Ccame in and interviewed everybody who had any sort of intimate scenes, asking us where we would want to be touched and things like that,\\u201D Mizuhara said. \\u201CAnd on the day, they would protect you and look after you, deciding who can be in the scene in terms of the crew. The fact that the scene was controlled gave us a sense of security.\\u201D\\u201CI think up until now, and especially in Japanese filmmaking, it was kind of vague when it came to how people would behave in these scenes, because there weren't any sort of concrete rules. People would be a little shy with discussing it as well, and I thought maybe we could do something about that,\\u201D she added. \\u201CEspecially with this film, some of the really important scenes are really intimate, like my sex scene with Honami \\u2014 that is the key in this film. The intimacy coordinator being part of the project gave the chance for everybody to commit to these scenes, to understand what it needs and that it needs to be protected, and to look at things the same way.

As he infiltrates the Illinois chapter of the Black Panthers, O\\u2019Neal grows closer to Hampton and eventually provides information leading to the Dec. 4, 1969, predawn raid where Hampton was killed by Chicago police officers. He was 21.Of the two films, \\u201CJudas\\u201D presents a more detailed image of Hampton and the charisma and intellect that marked his time as a leader in the Illinois Panthers. But some scholars of Hampton and the Black Panthers at large argue that the film only glosses over his political outlook and the Panthers\\u2019 impact on social and economic justice.\\u201CIt's great that Hollywood is giving credence to the martyrs and icons of the movement,\\u201D says Jakobi Williams, an associate professor of history at Indiana University-Bloomington. \\u201CThe downside of it is that some of this is hyperbole, incorrect and misleading.\\u201DWilliams, the author of \\u201CFrom the Bullet to the Ballot: The Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther Party and Racial Coalition Politics in Chicago,\\u201D said he does not endorse or promote the film, emphasizing that it \\u201Cis not a biopic of Fred Hampton.\\u201DStill, the movie has garnered critical and popular acclaim, highlighting that there is a new desire and appetite for better understanding about the Panthers and Hampton himself.Frederick Allen Hampton was born in 1948, as the youngest of three children to Francis and Iberia Hampton. The family settled in Maywood, Illinois, a middle-class suburb of Chicago, during Hampton\\u2019s youth.Hampton\\u2019s activist work began early. As a high school student, Hampton organized student campaigns for more Black teachers and administrators, pressed the school to select its first Black homecoming queen, and led protests at the Maywood police station.In 1966, Hampton, by then a junior college student, was recruited to join the West Suburban NAACP chapter and eventually led the branch\\u2019s Youth Council.By 1968, however, Hampton had grown frustrated with both the NAACP and the civil rights movement at large. After meeting a member of the Black Panther Party during the organization\\u2019s tour stop in Chicago, he absorbed the organization's calls for class solidarity and armed self-defense.In footage used in the 1971 documentary, \\u201CThe Murder of Fred Hampton,\\u201D the young activist discusses what pushed him to join the movement. \\u201CI was born in a bourgeois community and had some of the better things in life,\\u201D he says. \\u201CBut I found that there were more people starving than there were people eating, more people that didn\\u2019t have clothes than did have clothes, and I just happened to be one of the few. So I decided that I wouldn\\u2019t stop doing what I\\u2019m doing until all those people are free.\\u201DHampton became a founding member and spokesman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party in 1968. He gained notoriety among young Black Chicagoans with his magnetic personality and searing rhetoric on topics from local police violence, community control of programs, and his opposition to the Vietnam War.But Hampton\\u2019s most repeated argument was focused on class solidarity. A self-identified Marxist-Leninist, he argued that communities needed to unite together to fight capitalism and continue efforts like the Poor People\\u2019s Campaign led by Martin Luther King Jr.\\u201CWe're going to fight racism with solidarity,\\u201D Hampton said in a 1969 speech. \\u201CWe say you don't fight capitalism with no Black capitalism; you fight capitalism with socialism.\\u201DWhile the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense was founded by Bobby Seale and Huey Newton in California in 1966 with a focus on ending police brutality and the importance of armed self-defense, the organization also strongly supported providing resources to poor communities. The Panther\\u2019s \\u201Csurvival programs'' included free breakfast programs for children, medical clinics and food pantries, each serving as a criticism of the federal government\\u2019s failure to provide for its citizens.Hampton saw the programs as a crucial part of the larger push for community empowerment and self-determination, saying in an undated speech that \\u201Cfirst you have free breakfasts, then you have free medical care, then you have free bus rides, and soon you have freedom!\\u201DThe Illinois Panthers also made sure to highlight that their movement for Black self-determination and community control would not come at the expense of other communities. Chicago had historically been (and still is) one of the most residentially segregated cities in America. The Panthers argued that the poverty, discrimination and police harassment Black Chicagoans faced was also being experienced by other marginalized communities in the city. As such, the best way to fight these issues would be for poor communities across the city to come together to advocate as a united group.Through the work of Bob Lee, a member of the Panthers, and Hampton\\u2019s powerful oratory, the Panthers established the Rainbow Coalition, a multiracial alliance led by the Black Panther Party that included Puerto Rican activists, white former Southerners and other radical organizations from around Chicago. Hampton saw the alliance as \\u201Ca political coalition that respected ethnic communities of all kinds led by poor, Black youth.\\u201D The coalition quickly went to work as groups like the Young Lords, a Puerto Rican gang turned civil rights group, and the Young Patriots, a group of poor former white Southerners, organized around the needs of their respective communities and adapted the Panthers\\u2019 survival programs for their neighborhoods.The coalition frequently denounced the administration of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, a Democrat who ran a powerful political machine. The local Panthers criticized Daley for encouraging police harassment in poor neighborhoods, for stifling the political chances of independent Black politicians unaffiliated with his group, and for pursuing an aggressive urban renewal campaign that pushed poor people into increasingly desolate conditions.The Rainbow Coalition raised Hampton\\u2019s profile in Chicago, and his growing influence within the Black Panther Party made him a target of federal surveillance. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover declared the group the \\u201Cgreatest threat to internal security\\u201D of the United States. Hampton was one of many Black activists watched by the FBI\\u2019s COINTELPRO, a covert counterintelligence operation of the 1950s and ʼ60s.The FBI kept a close eye on Panther activities, with the help of informants and infiltrators. One such infiltrator was William O\\u2019Neal, the main subject of \\u201CJudas and the Black Messiah,\\u201D who joined the Illinois Panthers chapter and closely monitored Hampton.The FBI worked closely with police in Chicago and passed along information requested by the Daley administration, which pressured federal officials for information. \\u201CThe local government is way more sinister than the FBI,\\u201D Williams says of the law enforcement efforts to monitor and subvert the Illinois Panthers.The relationship between local police and the FBI led to the 1969 raid at a Chicago apartment used as a hangout by many of the Illinois Panthers. In the early morning, a group of 14 Chicago police officers knocked on the door and then opened fire, fatally striking Panther Mark Clark. Officers continued to fire as they entered the residence, shooting more than 90 rounds and wounding several Panthers inside. Hampton had been sleeping in a back bedroom at the time of the raid.The officers argued that they shot him in self-defense, but witnesses said that Hampton remained asleep and that an officer shot him point-blank in the head. The Cook County state\\u2019s attorney at the time, Edward Hanrahan, argued that the Panthers had fired first and that the officers had responded to protect themselves. He initially tried to charge all of the survivors of the raid with attempted murder.But that claim was quickly refuted after Panthers gave reporters access to the apartment after the raid, revealing that virtually all of the shots had been fired into the apartment by police. A federal grand jury found that the raid was \\u201Cill-conceived,\\u201D but ultimately declined to indict the officers.The surviving Panthers described \\u201Cnothing short of deliberate murder\\u201D in the hours after the raid, Jeffrey Haas, Hampton\\u2019s lawyer, wrote in \\u201CThe Assassination of Fred Hampton: How the FBI and the Chicago Police Murdered a Black Panther.\\u201D\\u201CThe raid looked like an assassination,\\u201D Haas wrote.Haas helped represent Hampton\\u2019s and Clark\\u2019s families, as well as the survivors of the raid, in a 1970 civil lawsuit that named city and federal officials as part of a conspiracy to conduct the raid. The legal battle revealed several details about COINTELPRO\\u2019s focus on the Panthers. The case was settled in 1982 for $1.85 million.While Hampton\\u2019s story has long been a significant part of the history of the Black Power movement, his life as an influential activist and organizer has not been readily documented or highlighted in popular media until now. Part of this is due to a longstanding narrative surrounding the Panthers that frames them as an exclusively violent, anti-white organization, a characterization that ignores the ways that they were heavily active in helping Black communities and encouraged relationships with other marginalized people.For some observers, \\u201CJudas and the Black Messiah,\\u201D a Hollywood production that has already won major awards for actors like Kaluuya this season (Golden Globe for best supporting actor) as well as six Oscar nominations, including best picture, goes a long way toward helping to counter this narrative by providing a closer look at the Panthers and the ways that they were targeted by the federal government.\\\"The movie isn't a rah-rah pro-Panther narrative or an anti-Panther narrative. It's very much steeped in historical understanding,\\\" David F. Walker, who wrote a graphic novel about the Black Panther Party, told NBC News in February.But for scholars of Hampton\\u2019s history and politics, the film, while a great display of his charisma and dynamic nature, falls short in actually telling his story or that of the Illinois Panthers.Williams, the history professor, is working on a book about the Rainbow Coalition and is helping to develop a school curriculum in Chicago schools about Hampton and the Panthers. He said the film fails to truly engage with parts of the Panthers\\u2019 work, like the transformative nature of the Rainbow Coalition or its free survival programs. He added that the movie doesn\\u2019t acknowledge the role that women played in the Illinois chapter, in particular, and is overly sympathetic in its depiction of O\\u2019Neal.\\u201CIf you watch the movie, it\\u2019s all about guns and violence and shootouts,\\u201D he says. \\u201CIt reinforces stereotypes.\\u201DBut the renewed attention to Hampton could help bring further awareness of the longstanding influence of the Panthers\\u2019 work on things like free school breakfast and lunch programs, and on the ways that its idea for the Rainbow Coalition would transform political organizing and help lead not only to the election of Chicago\\u2019s first Black mayor, Harold Washington, in 1983, but also become an aspect of the political playbook that helped drive the election of the nation\\u2019s first Black president, Barack Obama, in 2008.And as the nation grapples with the same issues of racial injustice and police violence that Hampton spoke out against more than 50 years ago, his words are affecting a new generation of community activists and organizers.Ultimately, Williams said, he hopes that more people are inspired to learn about Hampton and the Panthers. \\u201CFred Hampton is the most important political figure in the 20th century that most people have never heard of,\\u201D he said.Follow NBCBLK on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.P.R.

A shotgun was seized from his home.FBI agents who interviewed the teenager last April found no criminal violation at the time and determined he possessed no \\\"racially motivated violent extremism ideology,\\\" said Paul Keenan, special agent in charge of the FBI's Indianapolis field office.But the New York-based Sikh Coalition, a civil rights advocacy group, called for a full investigation into \\\"the possibility of bias as factor\\\" in the FedEx killings.Four members of the Sikh faith \\u2014 three women and a man \\u2014 were among the dead in Thursday night\\u2019s shooting spree, and at least one Sikh individual was wounded, said Gurinder Singh Khalsa, a businessman and leader of the local Sikh community who said he was briefed by victims\\u2019 families.Singh Khalsa also told Reuters the majority of employees at the FedEx site are Sikhs, whose religion originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent.He said the FedEx center was known for hiring older members of the local Sikh community who did not necessarily speak fluent English.The Sikh Coalition's executive director, Satjeet Kaur, said more than 8,000 Sikh-Americans live in Indiana.The recent surge in U.S. mass gun violence began on March 16 when a gunman shot eight people to death, including six Asian woman, at three Atlanta-area day spas before he was arrested.That rampage heightened tensions already brewing over a rise in hate crimes and discrimination directed at Asian Americans in recent years, stoked in part by racially inflammatory rhetoric about the coronavirus pandemic's origins in China.Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States perpetrated by the Islamist militant group al Qaeda, Sikh men have sometimes been confused publicly with Muslims because they wear turbans with their hair and beards uncut.The eight people killed in Thursday night's violence ranged in age from 19 to 74. The shooting lasted only a couple of minutes and was over by the time police responded to the scene, Craig McCartt, the Indianapolis police department's deputy chief, said on Friday.Witnesses described a chaotic attack, as the gunman opened fire with a rifle in the parking lot before entering the facility and continuing to shoot, leaving victims both inside and outside the building. Officers found the suspect dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.McCartt told reporters the suspect was believed to have last worked at the plant in the fall of 2020.Asked what brought him back to the facility on Thursday night, McCartt replied: \\\"I wish I could answer that.\\\"Neither authorities nor FedEx officials would say what ended Hole\\u2019s employment at FedEx.Follow NBC Asian America on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Books that show Asian Americans have never been silent","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/asian-america\/books-show-asian-americans-never-silent-rcna670","content":"As the long-standing xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans reached the national consciousness after the recent surge of anti-Asian attacks and the Atlanta area shootings, there were countless calls for the community to \\u201Cbreak our silence.\\u201DBut Asian Americans have never been silent. They have long been vocal about injustices \\u2014 from resistance to racist immigration laws, anti-Chinese purges and lynchings to fighting against Japanese American incarceration, organizing labor strikes, advocating for civil rights and protesting against war, imperialism and police brutality. Inspired by Black Power and other movements led by people of color, the inherently political term \\u201CAsian American\\u201D was coined by in the late 1960s by students and activists resisting marginalization, racism and gentrification. But as the model minority stereotype gained traction, pitting ethnic groups against one another, the story of radical Asian Americans was not one the media or U.S. history textbooks necessarily wanted to tell. From biographies and fiction to memoir, poetry and nonfiction, these eight books highlight some of the ways the community has organized, advocated and fought against oppression over the years.The history of student movements in the turbulent 1960s at San Francisco State University, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of California, Los Angeles, is chronicled in \\u201CMountain Movers: Student Activism and the Emergence of Asian American Studies.\\u201DWhile sharing nine oral histories of prior and more recent student activists, the anthology shows how organizing and student strikes led to the establishment of Asian American studies on their respective campuses and other universities, which empowered the community at large. The first published book of poetry by a Marshallese author, \\u201CIep Jāltok: Poems from a Marshallese Daughter\\u201D by Kathy Jetñil-Kijiner calls attention to the decades of colonialism, environmental destruction and social injustice experienced by the Marshallese people. Born in the Pacific\\u2019s Marshall Islands and raised in Hawaii, Jetñil-Kijiner\\u2019s lyrical debut collection, published in 2017, raises serious issues such as nuclear testing, racism and climate change that have and continue to affect both the Marshallese and the diaspora. First published in 1957, \\u201CNo-No Boy\\u201D is a fictional story of the real-life \\u201Cno-no boys\\u201D who answered \\u201Cno\\u201D twice to a compulsory government questionnaire asking if they would serve in the armed forces and swear loyalty to America after being forcibly incarcerated by the U.S. government because of their Japanese ancestry during World War II. Through protagonist Ichiro Yamada, who is sentenced to two years in prison for his refusals, the novel explores the fractured postwar Japanese American community.  In 1965, Filipino farmworkers sat in the grape fields of Delano, California, starting the strike that led to a dramatic shift in the long history of farm labor struggles in the Golden State. Their efforts were the impetus for the United Farm Workers union under Cesar Chavez. In his oral memoir, the late Philip Vera Cruz, the union\\u2019s vice-president, reflects on the discrimination, disgraceful living conditions and oppressive labor practices of the manong generation, the first group of Filipino immigrants to arrive in the U.S. in the 1920s and the 1930s who worked in agricultural jobs in California and Hawaii. A cultural history of Asian American activism in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, \\u201CChains of Babylon: The Rise of Asian America\\u201D traces the rise of the radically antiracist Asian American movement. The book demonstrates how Asians of numerous ethnicities united in racial solidarity under the \\u201CAsian American\\u201D umbrella and how the Black Power and antiwar movements influenced activists to band together and oppose racism in the U.S., as well as imperialism abroad.A collection of oral history narratives spotlighting young Vietnamese American community and labor organizers, \\u201CMany Bridges, One River: Organizing for Justice in Vietnamese American Communities,\\u201D highlights the complexities of working in Viet communities. From anti-war efforts of the Union of Vietnamese in the United States in the 1970s to LBGTQ campaigns in California and post-Hurricane Katrina work in the Gulf Coast, the book examines struggles around \\\"redbaiting,\\\" sexism, homophobia, language barriers and intergenerational differences.The first biography of Yuri Kochiyama, who famously cradled Malcolm X in her arms as he died inside the Audubon Ballroom in 1965, \\u201CHeartbeat of a Struggle\\u201D surveys the legendary civil rights activist\\u2019s life, from her \\u201Call-American\\u201D childhood to her family\\u2019s forcible incarceration during the war. The traumatic experience led Kochiyama to four decades of tireless social justice work fighting for Black liberation, Asian American equality, Puerto Rican independence and political prisoner defense. The result of five years of field research with progressive activists, \\u201CDesi Divas: Political Activism in South Asian American Cultural Performances\\u201D analyzes how traditional cultural forms are used by performance activists to address gender inequality, immigration rights, hate crimes and religious violence. The in-depth book features the School for Indian Languages and Cultures, or SILC, South Asian Americans Leading Together, or SAALT, the feminist dance collective Post Natyam and the grassroots feminist political organization South Asian Sisters."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Sikh community mourns loss of four in Indianapolis FedEx mass shooting","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/sikh-community-mourns-loss-four-indianapolis-fedex-mass-shooting-n1264413","content":"At least four of the eight employees who were killed during the FedEx mass shooting in Indianapolis late Thursday night were members of the Sikh community.The Sikh Coalition, which is the nation's largest Sikh civil rights and advocacy organization, confirmed the tragic news on Saturday.\\\"Sadly, we acknowledge that this number is subject to change for the worse as more information becomes publicly available and those who were injured are treated at area hospitals,\\\" the group said in a statement.Komal Chohan, a member of the coalition, said that her maternal grandmother, Amarjeet Kaur Johal, 66, \\\"is among those killed in the senseless shooting.\\\"\\\"Our families should not feel unsafe at work, at their place of worship, or anywhere.

Stop right f---ing now! Hey show me your f---ing hands! Drop it,\\u201D the officer, who has been identified as Eric Stillman, said. Body-camera footage made public by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability shows Adam being shot in the chest immediately after he put both of his hands up.Stillman's attorney, Timothy M. Grace, said in a statement that the officer had no choice because he \\u201Chad no place to take cover or concealment, the gun was being orientate[d] in his direction and he was left with no other option.\\u201DBased on the video from the shooting officer, it was not clear if Toledo was holding a gun when he was being chased down the alley.Police later released an edited timeline video that showed a firearm lying on the ground at the scene of the shooting. It also featured freeze frames of the firing officer's body camera video that police say shows Toledo was holding a gun immediately before he was shot. Footage from a nearby surveillance camera that captured the shooting appears to show Adam toss something with his right hand behind a wooden fence before facing the approaching officer, who quickly fired his weapon.While there's all this debate about what happened leading up to the shooting, there\\u2019s no doubt that \\u201Cthe child had his hands up, he was surrendering, and the police shot him anyway,\\u201D Nicole González Van Cleve, a sociology associate professor at Brown University, told NBC News. \\u201CSo, compliance doesn't seem to save you, not even a child.\\u201D\\u201CHow do we get to a point where the police aren't thinking of the vulnerability of a 13-year-old, rather than seeing that 13-year-old in this kind of monster framework,\\u201D said González Van Cleve, the author of \\u201CCrook County: Racism and Injustice in America's Largest Criminal Court,\\u201D which examines racial bias in Chicago's legal system. \\u201CIf you were in a white neighborhood and saw a child out at 2 a.m., you would escort them home, right?\\u201DIn Chicago, police kill Latinos at a rate six times higher than white people, said González Van Cleve, who grew up in the area.Adam's killing is one of the latest high-profile incidents of police shootings of Latinos. Data analyzed by The Washington Post shows that Latinos have been killed by police at the second-highest rate, after Black Americans, over the past five years.\\u201CI feel grief, anger and pain.

And the prosecutors were clearly trying to cover it up, not because this is some scandal, but this is what they often do for police,\\u201D González Van Cleve said, adding that Adam\\u2019s case seems to be consistent with a troublesome pattern she uncovered during her decadelong investigation looking into racial abuse in Chicago\\u2013Cook County\\u2019s legal culture.\\u201CIf you're a prosecutor, you need police officers to win cases in order for you to get promoted within the system,\\u201D a pattern that discourages prosecutors from questioning the truthfulness behind the officers\\u2019 version of an incident, González Van Cleve said. \\u201CThere's no manual for this, but this is just how they have been trained informally through generations of attorneys passing down these norms.\\u201DThe Toledo family put out a statement on Friday urging calm ahead of planned protests.\\\"The Toledo family implores everyone who gathers in Adam's name to remain peaceful, respectful and nonviolent and to continue to work constructively and tirelessly for reform,\\\" said the statement by attorney Adeena Weiss Ortiz. \\\"The family is forever grateful to the leaders and members of Chicago's Latino community and the residents of Little Village for their support in this time of grief and mourning.\\\"Some Little Village residents are now calling for Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown to step down and for the U.S. Department of Justice to get involved, NBC Chicago reported.Adam\\u2019s death has also catapulted needed conversations about police reform in communities of color, where chronic disinvestment in education and youth services have persisted for years, Fuentes said.\\\"Police officers are supposed to serve the people, and they have been killing our youngest, the people that need them the most,\\\" Fuentes said. \\\"We must completely revaluate, what does policing look like?

Díaz-Canel, 60, represents a new generation and is serving the first of two five-year terms as president.Many analysts believe Castro, who turns 90 in June, will continue to be the most influential figure on the island until his death.In Cuba, major events are put together during historic celebrations and this year\\u2019s congress is no exception. It coincides with the 60th anniversary of the failed, CIA-backed Bay of Pigs invasion.Castro\\u2019s retirement comes as Cuba, one of the last communist run-countries in the world, is facing multiple challenges. Its economy shrank 11 percent in 2020 due to the pandemic, and it's been grappling with tightened U.S. sanctions and a decline in aid from its ally, Venezuela. The government lacks hard currency to import food and medicine, which means endless lines outside stores when food becomes available, and one meal a day for some families.The country is also dealing with a spike in Covid-19 cases. Strict lockdowns and measures have kept the numbers of cases and deaths below those of most countries in the region, but they have also tested the patience of many Cubans. Cuba has developed five vaccine candidates and two are in late-stage trials.The country\\u2019s challenges have led to public discontent at levels rarely seen since the 1959 communist revolution. Mobile internet has allowed videos of protests to quickly spread among Cubans and also helped activists mobilize. A large protest in November by artists demanding greater freedom of expression made headlines across the globe.President Joe Biden campaigned on reversing some of the previous administration\\u2019s harsh measures, such as limits on remittances and restricted travel to the island by Americans while focusing on human rights. But so far, administration officials have indicated they won\\u2019t be making changes anytime soon. Juan Gonzalez, executive director of the National Security Council, said recently that the \\u201Cpolitical moment\\u201D has changed from the Obama administration years and that \\u201Coppression against Cubans is worse today than perhaps during the Bush years.\\u201DDisenchantment in the island over the country\\u2019s centrally planned system, stagnant economy and decaying infrastructure has been brewing for years, especially among younger Cubans. During the Communist Party\\u2019s congress in 2011, a set of ambitious economic reforms were promised that have not been fully implemented.Victoria Hernández 37, an entrepreneur who sells products such as hangers and batteries in East Havana, says she does not expect much from the congress.\\u201CI think our officials should change their mentality more to improve things. Right now what we\\u2019re thinking about is food. I want to also think about having a car, a better house,\\u201D she said.But some experts believe Castro's move is important in order to speed up economic reforms. This involves strategic decisions in order to keep the public more content without ceding the tight grip the party has over society.Arturo López-Levy, a professor at Holy Names University in California, thinks the economic reforms will gain traction once the pandemic is under control.\\u201CWhat is happening now is a new generation is consolidating control,\\u201D he said. \\u201CNow they will be forced to make important reforms, because their legitimacy doesn't come from a revolutionary background, but from being capable of showing better performance.\\u201DHe said there aren\\u2019t high expectations among Cubans because the country \\u201Cwill remain a Leninist system and that basically means the political monopoly of the Communist Party.\\u201DFabio Fernández, a history professor at the University of Havana, often quoted in the Communist Party newspaper Granma, says it\\u2019s important for the party to move forward, fulfill the economic reforms it promised over a decade ago, and make political changes without abandoning its socialist system.\\u201CA new concept of Cuban socialism is what we need to adopt because the old one no longer works,\\u201D he said.Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.Carmen Sesin is a reporter based in Miami.Orlando Matos is an NBC News producer based in Havana, Cuba. "},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Statehood or self-determination? Tensions over Puerto Rico status rise amid opposing bills","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/latino\/statehood-or-self-determination-tensions-over-puerto-rico-status-rise-n1264184","content":"Competing bills in Congress have reignited tensions around Puerto Rico's future territorial status and its relationship to the mainland, but a rare congressional hearing has brought a new sense of urgency among lawmakers debating whether to support statehood or a different pathway towards determining the U.S. territory's relationship to the federal government.The Committee on Natural Resources Office of Insular Affairs hosted a legislative hearing on Wednesday to discuss the competing bills in an effort to engage Congress on Puerto Rico's future \\u2014 a subject many members have avoided in the past.The issue of status has long divided Puerto Ricans on the U.S. territory in large part due to how their local political party system is organized. Most people support either the pro-statehood New Progressive Party or the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the island's current commonwealth status. A smaller percentage of \\\"independentistas\\\" support the Puerto Rican Independence Party, which advocates for the island's independence from the U.S.Such divisions have percolated into Congress in the form of two opposing bills.Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., and Rep. Jenniffer González, Puerto Rico's nonvoting member of Congress and a Republican, introduced bicameral and bipartisan legislation last month offering statehood to Puerto Rico following a nonbinding referendum in November that directly asked voters whether Puerto Rico should be admitted as a state. With nearly 55 percent voter turnout, about 53 percent of Puerto Ricans who voted favored statehood while 47 percent rejected it, according to Puerto Rico's Elections Commission.Another bicameral and bipartisan bill from Rep. Nydia Velázquez, D-N.Y., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., proposes an inclusive self-determination process by creating a \\\"status convention\\\" made up of delegates elected by Puerto Rican voters who would be responsible for coming up with long-term solutions for the island's territorial status \\u2014 statehood, independence, a free association or other options beyond its current territorial arrangement.\\u201CThe Self-Determination Act does not impose one option on the people of Puerto Rico. Instead, it allows for a thorough discussion about the implications of each of the status option and what transitional plans would look like,\\u201D Velázquez said. \\u201CPuerto Ricans have never had the benefit of having any of this information upfront. Congress should commit itself to following through on the self-determination process.\\u201DGonzález blasted Velázquez\\u2019s bill saying it \\u201Cshamelessly ignores the will of voters in Puerto Rico.\\u201D\\u201CLetting the losing minority deny the clear choice of the majority in a free and fair vote isn\\u2019t democracy, and the United States must not take part in such an egregious act,\\u201D González said.During the lengthy hearing, pro-statehood witnesses continued slamming the self-determination bill, arguing that the proposed process unnecessarily stretches a debate Puerto Ricans on the island have been having for over five decades and opens a pathway to debate territorial options that may not be consistent with U.S. constitutional law.Aníbal Acevedo-Vilá, former governor of Puerto Rico under the Popular Democratic Party, one of the witnesses defending the self-determination bill, said that one of the key parts of that legislation is the creation of a congressional negotiating commission. It would answer the many legal, constitutional, cultural and economic questions that will surface as Puerto Rico discusses ways to transition out of their current status.\\u201CThere's a lot of things that need to be clarified by Congress before people vote,\\u201D Acevedo-Vilá said.Rep. Ed Case, D-Hawaii, expressed solidarity with the complexities of Puerto Rico\\u2019s status debate, saying that while he is \\u201Cstrongly inclined\\u201D towards favoring the statehood bill, it does trouble him that \\u201Cthe indication from the voters of Puerto Rico thus far has not been at the same level of overwhelming agreement with statehood\\u201D compared to some of the states that were last admitted into the union, when statehood support was at over 60 percent.\\u201CI wish it was higher because then it would be an easier decision,\\u201D he said.Generations of Puerto Ricans have longed viewed their ambiguous relationship to the U.S. as having the best of two worlds, since they are born U.S. citizens while also having authority over their own internal governance. But debates questioning this status have intensified over the last decade following a series of crises and natural disasters that have shined a light on the flaws of Puerto Rico\\u2019s current status.Puerto Ricans living on the island are U.S. citizens who are unable to vote for president. They don't pay federal income taxes, since they don't have voting representation in Congress. But they do pay payroll taxes, helping fund federal programs such as Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Earned Income Tax Credit, which often serve as lifelines in a territory where 44 percent of the population lives in poverty. But as a U.S. territory, Puerto Rico receives less money to fund these programs compared to states.\\u201CRegarding the status problem, Puerto Rico has been the victim and the United States, the perpetrator,\\u201D María de Lourdes Santiago, senator of Puerto Rico under the Independence Party, said in Spanish during her testimony supporting the self-determination bill. \\u201CContrary to the case of Washington D.C., Puerto Rico is financially bankrupt as a result of the failure of the colonial relationship.\\u201DAfter U.S. laws arbitrarily excluded Puerto Rico from the federal bankruptcy code, blocking the island from resolving their $72 billion debt crisis through Chapter 9, Congress passed the PROMESA law in 2016 to create a federally appointed fiscal board tasked with restructuring the debt. The move has resulted in tough austerity measures.Dr. Christina D. Ponsa-Kraus, a law professor at Columbia Law School, said during her testimony that statehood would not only grant Puerto Rico the presidential vote, two senators and four or five representatives \\u2014 but it would also \\u201Cguarantee equality in legislation that the federal government passes to aid and address issues in the States.\\u201D\\u201CAs a territory, Puerto Rico is subject either to exclusion from certain programs, such as SSI or to caps in benefit programs,\\u201D Ponsa-Kraus said. She added that for Puerto Ricans who want a union with the U.S. and citizenship for themselves, \\u201Cstatehood is your only option because the other options don't guarantee you either of those things.\\u201DJosé Fuentes, chairman of the Puerto Rico Statehood Council and Puerto Rico\\u2019s former attorney general, advocated for the statehood bill during his testimony, pointing out that \\u201Cpolitics are playing a role in this process that is really unacceptable.\\u201DBut he anticipated that the issue around Puerto Rico's status will grow in importance as more Puerto Ricans continue moving to the states \\u201Cto get better quality of life.\\u201D\\u201CWe now have 3 million Puerto Ricans living on the island, 6 million living in the mainland. That starts to create political power,\\u201D Fuentes said, adding that political power starts to be recognized as more lawmakers meaningfully engage in the debate around Puerto Rico's future.Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.Nicole Acevedo is a reporter for NBC News Digital.

Even gardening grew in popularity for those hoping for a distraction during the spring.SKIP AHEAD Best string trimmersShopping readers have been increasingly interested in patio furniture sales and expert-recommended gas grills, too. Sprucing up greenery around your home might be on your to-do list ahead of the summer \\u2014 and one of the tools that might be handy to have on hand is a string trimmer. We consulted experts on what string trimmers are, how they work and what are the best string trimmers to consider right now.Designed to complement a lawn mower and target the weeds it can\\u2019t catch, a string trimmer is \\u201Cprimarily used to create crisp lawn edges and lawn borders after mowing to give that nice, polished look,\\u201D explained Kristin Monji, founder of landscaping firm Birch and Basil Design.You'll sometimes see string trimmers referred to as weed trimmers, weed whackers and grass trimmers. \\u201CThese are all the same product with slightly different descriptions based on how a consumer is using them,\\u201D said Monji.There\\u2019s also a company called Weed Eaters, which makes its own line of string trimmers \\u2014 and this causes \\u201Csome confusion as there are many people who refer to the tool itself as a weed eater, regardless of which brand it is,\\u201D explained Joshua Bateman, a landscaper and owner of Prince Gardening in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. But string trimmer is the most common name for this tool \\u2014 that\\u2019s how you\\u2019ll find it marketed at retailers like The Home Depot and Lowe\\u2019s.String trimmers are powered by either gas, electricity or a battery. Here\\u2019s how Will Hudson, senior merchant of outdoor power equipment for The Home Depot, explained the differences between the three.\\u201CMy pick for homeowners would be a powerful battery model so you don't need to worry about wires or filling with gas,\\u201D Monji said. For the average yard, Bateman agreed that battery-powered string trimmer would be best, especially since he has seen battery life improve significantly in recent years. The kinds of weeds in your front or back yard also can help you decide whether you need an electric, gas or battery-powered trimmer. With thick weeds or overgrown lawns, an electric or battery powered trimmer could struggle more than one that uses gas, Bateman said.But that doesn't mean gas or electric string trimmers shouldn\\u2019t be used at home. For larger properties, gas provides the most power \\u2014these trimmers do generally require more upkeep and are heavier to carry around, Bateman advised. And electric string trimmers, which tend to be the most affordable of the three, are more suitable for small yards since a cord can only go so far, he added.We\\u2019ve compiled expert-recommended string trimmers across gas, electric, and battery-powered options and price ranges.Bateman\\u2019s favorite battery powered trimmer is this foldable model from DEWALT, a purveyor of power tools. He praised the battery of this string trimmer, saying it runs longer than many others on the market \\u2014 more than 950 reviewers at Home Depot left it a 4.4-star average rating. Besides the battery and the ability to toggle between two speeds, this trimmer features a 14-inch swath surrounding one side of the head and designed to help it cut through wider areas.Gary McCoy, a Lowe\\u2019s store manager in Charlotte, North Carolina, recommended EGO\\u2019s line of electric string trimmers. These trimmers \\u201Cimpress with a single battery platform capable of matching or exceeding the performance of conventional gas models, all without the noise or fumes,\\u201D he said. This model boasts a 4.8-star rating over more than 200 reviews on Amazon. The trimmer features a 15-inch cutting swath and a motor that\\u2019s designed for low vibrations. The battery is compatible with other EGO POWER+ tools and includes LED charging indicators. You can find the tool itself, without the battery included, at Lowe\\u2019s and Ace Hardware.Bateman suggested this model as \\u201Ca much cheaper option that gets the job done for small yards.\\u201D It features an 18-inch cutting path to cover more ground and a molded grip handle to make it easier to use in your hand. The trimmer also includes a lock to keep the cord in place as you move around the lawn. It\\u2019s a popular pick with Amazon shoppers, earning a 4.4-star rating over close to 2,000 reviews.Monji recommended this string trimmer, describing it as \\u201Cwell-priced for the performance and features.\\u201D The trimmer includes a two-speed switch and can be adjusted to cut 13 to 15 inches in width. The handle is adjustable as well. The battery and charger on this model are compatible with other tools in the Ryobi One+ line. At Home Depot, this trimmer boasts an average 4.2-star rating over close to 700 reviews.For professional use, Bateman\\u2019s pick is this trimmer from STIHL, which is well-known for its chainsaws and other outdoor equipment. It features a rubberized loop handle to grip at the center of the shaft and baffles, which are tools that help reduce the noise coming from the trimmer. Bateman also said this trimmer could work well for those with larger properties. \\u201CThis gas-powered trimmer is exceptionally easy to start, has a ton of power for cutting through tall weeds and has reduced vibration which is great for longer use,\\u201D Bateman explained. Although sold out on STIHL\\u2019s own website, you can find the model at Ace Hardware and receive free in-store or curbside pick up with it.While the experts recommended their favorites, here are a few retailers (in alphabetical order) that carry a range of string trimmers to use outdoors.Simply put, a string trimmer operates \\u201Cwith a shaft and string line that uses a circular motion to cut grass or weeds,\\u201D explained McCoy. The shaft can be either curved or straight. Straight shafts typically offer more customization: You can choose add-ons to switch out of the string trimmer head, McCoy said. Some of these attachments are specially designed for edges, others for trees.The head of a string trimmer holds the spool. And the \\u201Cstring\\u201D in string trimmer does actually refer to a string. Many of the more modern string trimmers will have an easy-load spool to let you load string through two holes without having to remove the spool at all \\u2014 the spool winds up the string to work, Bateman noted. He recommended beginners find a string trimmer with an easy-load spool feature \\u2014 some traditional and professional-grade string trimmers require taking the entire spool out to replace the string.Since string trimmers can be powerful, it\\u2019s important to be prepared and protected before turning one on, explained Hudson, who offered up some specific tips.Ambar Pardilla is a reporter for NBC News Shopping."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Everlane's first ever swimwear collection is here","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/shopping\/apparel\/everlane-swimwear-collection-n1264198","content":"Our editors independently selected these items because we think you will enjoy them and might like them at these prices.

According to medical doctors we've consulted, as well as the CDC, it\\u2019s imperative to wear a face mask while working out to help protect yourself and others from the coronavirus. The CDC also advised that gym-goers should exercise in well-ventilated spaces and practice social distancing. When shopping for an exercise face mask, the trainers and doctors we consulted suggested masks made from moisture-wicking fabrics like polyester and nylon to help prevent the face masks from becoming drenched in sweat, which impact their efficacy.While not all states have mask mandates, it is sometimes up to individual gyms whether patrons are required to wear a face mask in order to enter their facilities. For example, face masks are recommended but not required at Equinox gyms in Texas. In Virginia, the only time Equinox members are allowed to remove their face masks is when they are exercising.Medical doctors and personal trainers rely on these eight exercise face masks when exercising, picks ranging from affordable finds to higher-end silk face masks.Under Armour's face mask is the most popular expert-recommended model on our list.

You aren\\u2019t alone: Many Americans are ditching public transportation in favor of other ways to commute. And for many, that means using two wheels as opposed to four. Electric bikes sales are skyrocketing, said Nate Nielsen, REI\\u2019s general manager for cycling, as consumers look for more environmentally-friendly, healthy ways of getting around.\\u201CIn some areas, our sales have just quadrupled in the past few months,\\u201D Nielsen said. \\u201CIt\\u2019s growing faster than any other category. It\\u2019s inspiring to see how people are embracing them.\\u201DSKIP AHEAD Best electric bicyclesElectric bikes, known as e-bikes, are regular bikes with an electric motor and battery attached to the back of the bike. The motor assists in pedaling the bike, but it\\u2019s not like a motorized scooter or motorcycle: You\\u2019ll still have to pedal, and you can\\u2019t go as fast. In fact, you don\\u2019t even need to use the motor if you don\\u2019t want to \\u2014 \\\"most models allow you to easily turn it on and off,\\\" said Nielsen.\\u201CE-bikes really only provide an extra boost to your own pedal power, allowing you to ride longer distances, tackle tougher climbs, and maintain a faster pace,\\u201D explained Andy Levine, founder and CEO and Duvine Cycling and Adventure Company, a bicycle tour company. While electric bikes are faster and more powerful than traditional bicycles, they\\u2019re also heavier.We\\u2019re calling them \\u2018The Great Equalizer.\\u2019Andy Levine, founder and CEO, Duvine Cycling and Adventure CompanyYes, said Nielsen: Electric bikes are for everyone, no matter their lifestyle.Maybe you\\u2019re an avid cyclist who wants to go on longer rides. Or maybe you\\u2019re a bit older or are rehabbing an injury and want to keep up with your friends and family. Or maybe you\\u2019re a commuter that wants to avoid public transportation but not show up to work sweaty, added Levine. For a company like Duvine, electric bikes have proven much easier for travelers to enjoy destinations otherwise might be too challenging to bike.\\u201CElectric assist gives you a fallback: more gain for less pain,\\u201D Levine said. \\u201CI feel the stigma surrounding e-bikes is swiftly disappearing and they\\u2019re beginning to be rebranded as the cool new tech in the cycling world. We\\u2019re calling them \\u2018The Great Equalizer.\\u2019\\u201DTo get it out of the way: Electric bikes are more expensive than non-electric bikes, said Nielsen. It will be difficult to find a solid bike under $1,000 \\u2014 the average cost is typically between $2,000 and $3,000, added Dax Downey, owner of Greenline Cycles, a bike shop in Chico, California. Spending a little more to get a durable bike will pay off in the long run, he explained. While you\\u2019re shopping for your electric bike, you\\u2019ll generally be looking at three \\u201Cclasses\\u201D of electric bikes:These classes determine the type of motor the bike uses, and if it\\u2019s able to be used in certain areas. All three classes\\u2019 motors are limited to 750 watts.When shopping for an electric bike, consider what you want to use it for. If you live somewhere flat or plan to ride mostly for short stretches on city streets, a commuter e-bike would work best for you \\u2014 that\\u2019s typically a class 1 electric bike. Avid bikers looking for a road bike should pay attention to battery life and max bike speed. Like with electric cars, you\\u2019ll need to charge your electric bike regularly (though not for as long as a car), and you\\u2019ll want to consider where to charge your bike. Most electric bike models allow you to remove the battery, but it\\u2019s not necessary in order to charge the bike.Beyond the general guidance above, the cycling experts we consulted noted other and more specific features to consider before buying an electric bike.To help you navigate the world of e-bikes, here are some of the best options on the market right now, according to the guidance we got from cycling experts above.This classic, class 1 bike is slightly more affordable than other models, and the \\u201CNeo\\u201D series from Cannondale is one of the most durable lines out there, said Downey. This model is made from Shimano parts and a Bosch battery, which can charge in 3.5 hours and lasts up to 65 miles without a recharge. It can hit a max speed of 20 miles per hour and weighs about 54 pounds. Another recommended Neo Bike is the Quick EQ, a pricier option but can last twice the distance with a single charge.If you\\u2019re an avid rider looking for an electric upgrade, this class 3 model may be worth the high price tag. This bike is extremely lightweight \\u2014 just over 26 pounds \\u2014 and allows you to track your ride via a dedicated app. The Neo 2 is made of high-quality Shimano parts and is designed for road riding. The battery lasts up to 75 kilometers and charges within hours. For experts, this model perfectly captures what you\\u2019ll get for a higher price tag.\\u201CYou can take it to the Alps and pretend you\\u2019re in the Tour de France,\\u201D said Levine.Designed for both short trips around town and longer trail rides, the class 1 model has step-over pedals, typically found on racing and mountain bikes, which offers additional pedal power and a more balanced ride. This model is made of Bosch parts and sports 27.5-inch tires and a battery that lasts up to 65 miles. Additional unique features include a SmartphoneHub controller, which monitors ride data and Electra\\u2019s patented Flat Foot technology, which moves the pedals forward relative to the saddle. This allows riders to get a full leg extension while riding (which can be more comfortable) and be able to put their feet flat on the ground when shopping.Downey recommended this versatile, class 1 electric bike from the brand\\u2019s \\u201CUrban\\u201D line. The hybrid electric bike, made of Shimano parts, has a low center of gravity, making it easy to mount and dismount, ideal for commuters or those taking shorter trips. It has a seat you adjust with a button on the handlebars and sports large, 27.5-inch tires. It falls in the middle of the electric bike price range.This class 2 e-bike is an affordable option for a novice cyclist or someone who wants an easy way to get around without many bells and whistles. Bikes come in two sizes based on the standover height of the frame. The light, seven-pound battery fits under the seat and has a 25-45 mile range, depending on how much you rely on the motor. Other basic features include a twist-grip throttle and LED control panel for adjusting between gears.This class 1 model is an affordable, highly-rated option from well-known bike retailer Schwinn. It\\u2019s perfect for commuters \\u2014 with five different pedal-assist modes and seven speeds (up to 20 mph). Riders can get only 30 miles on the battery (which charges in under six hours), much lower than other models on the list. But the low price makes this bike perfect for beginner cyclists or those biking shorter distances. The bike weighs a little over 50 pounds and has 26-inch tires.This sleek model is another class 3 e-bike, with strong acceleration and smooth turns, said Downey. The Vado comes with three assist levels, four sizes and a rear rack to attach your belongings. The model is made from Shimano parts, and the battery charges in a little over four hours and promises up to 50 miles in battery life. This bike is another good option for avid riders looking for a road electric bike at a more affordable price than the Neo 2.This foldable, affordable, class 1 bike is perfect for commuters or those who are low on storage space. The battery sits in the back on the bike for a lower center of gravity and it is made of Bosch electric parts. The battery can charge in between 2.5 hours and 4.5 hours and can last between 32 and 74 hours. It can reach up to 20 mph and weighs 58 pounds. Whether you\\u2019re taking your child for a ride or lugging your work bag to work, riders easily can attach an extra seat or bag in the back. The bike\\u2019s wheels are much smaller than other models, at 20 inches, which makes the entire bike frame lighter and easier to carry.This e-bike is ideal for anyone with cargo, including commuters. It comes with Shimano disc brakes (to avoid skidding) and has a very low center of gravity. Of course, it includes a wide basket that can fit gym bags and packages \\u2014 and even some pets, assuming they won\\u2019t jump out of the basket. Parents can even attach a seat in the back for kids. The battery lasts up to 75 kilometers on a single charge.Falling in the middle price range, the Vanmoof S3 brings a sleek and stylish design to their electric model, which is designed for riders 5\\u20198\\u201D to 6\\u20198\\u201D. Bikes come with an automatic gear-shifting system and disc brakes \\u2014 the brand also promises \\u201Cpuncture-resistant\\u201D tires. A key feature of the S3 is the theft defense system \\u2014 you can track your bike\\u2019s location or set off an alarm from your smartphone via Vanmoof\\u2019s app, which also tracks ride data. The battery has a range of 37 to 93 miles, about on par with other models.Catch up on the latest from NBC News Shopping guides and recommendations and download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak.Hanna Horvath is a personal finance reporter based in New York City.

It's a quick and easy way to apply sunscreen, and eliminates time you\\u2019d otherwise be spending rubbing in a messy, white and creamy substance. Spray sunscreen is sold by brands like Coppertone and Neutrogena and it\\u2019s easily accessible. You can purchase spray sunscreen in stores such as Sephora and Ulta, or online at retailers like Amazon and Dermstore.Harold Lancer, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in Beverly Hills, says that in the mind of a consumer, spray sunscreen is easier to apply. But it actually may be less efficient and less effective compared to cream, lotion and gel sunscreens, he added. We talked to Lancer \\u2014 who's consulted Beyoncé, Oprah, Margot Robbie and J.Lo, to name a few of his clients \\u2014 about how protective spray sunscreen really is and the best options on the market.This spray sunscreen is lightweight and breathable, so it won\\u2019t leave skin feeling sticky. It\\u2019s specifically designed for those participating in outdoor activities like running and playing volleyball.

This sunscreen is also non-comedogenic, which means it's designed to prevent clogging pores or irritating acne.The coconut fragrance infused into this sunscreen might transport you momentarily to a tropical island. It\\u2019s made from moisturizing ingredients \\u2014 like mineral oil and fruit extracts \\u2014 that leave a light texture on skin; it's designed so you won\\u2019t feel like you\\u2019re wearing sunscreen at all. Since this broad-spectrum sunscreen sprays on clear, it does not coat skin in a white residue.This broad-spectrum spray sunscreen is made from a zinc-based mineral formula. It\\u2019s hypoallergenic and good for those with sensitive skin. Sun Bum suggests shaking the bottle before using, and applying it to skin 15 minutes before sun exposure.Hint, known best for its fruit-infused water, also makes a line of spray sunscreen. It comes in three scents: Pineapple, Grapefruit and Pear. The sunscreen is water-resistant for up to 80 minutes and dries quickly once applied. You can purchase each scent individually or as a pack of three, and Hint sells travel-sized bottles of spray sunscreen to take with you on the go.PCA\\u2019s non-aerosol continuous spray sunscreen allows you to evenly coat skin. The product was created specifically for people who engage in outdoor activities like hiking and sports, as it provides sweat-resistant broad spectrum protection. This spray sunscreen was designed in compliance with Hawaii Act 104, which prohibits the sale and distribution of sunscreens that contain the chemicals oxybenzone and octinoxate in Hawaii. Since PCA\\u2019s spray sunscreen meets these standards, it\\u2019s ocean- and environmental-friendly.Neutrogena designed this spray sunscreen specifically for kids. It\\u2019s oil-free and hypoallergenic, as well as provides broad-spectrum protection. You can apply this spray sunscreen to wet or dry skin, making it easy to use right after kids get out of the pool or when they\\u2019re sweaty from playing outdoors.Supergoop\\u2019s spray sunscreen is powered by air, which makes its zinc-based formula free of chemical propellants.

You can spray the sunscreen on kids\\u2019 skin from any angle, providing maximum coverage. The sunblock is water-resistant for 80 minutes, useful for kids who love to swim or play in sprinklers.According to Lancer, people often think spray sunscreen is more effective than its cream, lotion and gel counterparts. However, that might not be the case. Whether or not spray sunscreen is effective at protecting skin also has to do with how often it's reapplied. He said sunscreen in any form should not be depended on alone; it\\u2019s best when paired with sun-avoidance accessories, like sunglasses, hats and visors.Because spray sunscreen is usually an aerosol product, Lancer said applying it can be quite difficult. Wind currents and airflow outside can move particles of spray sunscreen away from the body so not enough gets on skin. Because of this, Lancer said, you have to use a lot of spray sunscreen. Often, however, people don\\u2019t use nearly enough. Considering improperly applied sunscreen has, Lancer increasingly concerned about sunburns and the development of skin cancer. Additionally, inhaling spray sunscreen is dangerous, not to mention it can coat furniture (or toilet seats) and make floor surfaces slippery.Overall, Lancer thinks of spray sunscreen as similar to an electric toothbrush: It might seem \\u201Cbetter\\u201D in theory, but how much it really works depends on if it\\u2019s used properly.After you spray sunscreen to the body, it\\u2019s important to make sure you can see the substance on your skin. If you can\\u2019t, the particles probably got lost in the air. Lancer said it\\u2019s also critical to rub in spray sunscreen. If you don\\u2019t, there won\\u2019t be an even distribution across your skin, thus increasing the chance of getting sunburned. Regardless of the type of sunscreen you use, it needs to be applied every two hours, according to Lancer. If you\\u2019re participating in outdoor sports or are going in the water, you need to apply sunscreen every hour.In general, Lancer thinks using cream, lotion or gel sunscreen is a safer option when compared to spray sunscreen. But as long as you\\u2019re using some type of sunblock, Lancer said it\\u2019s better than nothing, adding many people think they\\u2019re invincible to skin cancer, so they\\u2019re lazy about using sunscreen and practicing sun avoidance.Zoe Malin is a digital editorial intern for NBC News Shopping."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"The 5 best pressure washers, according to experts","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/shopping\/home\/best-pressure-washers-n1263444","content":"Our editors independently selected these items because we think you will enjoy them and might like them at these prices.

Pressure washers are power tools that can scrub dirt and grime off major outdoor surfaces by pressurizing water from a hose using electric motors or gas engines.Pressure washers \\u201Ccan be extremely effective at removing tough stains or mildew on house siding, garage floors, wooden decks, brick and concrete patios, outdoor furniture, vehicles and even grills,\\u201D said Bailey Carson, head of cleaning at Handy. Experts told us that April and May are the best months for investing in a pressure washer \\u2014 which can cost anywhere from $90 to over $700 \\u2014 as it\\u2019s just before the summer rush when many manufacturers tend to sell out.Electric pressure washers use an electric motor or pump to boost the water pressure from your garden hose. According to David Steckel, a home expert at Thumbtack, electric pressure washers are more cost-effective, typically more lightweight and better for non-specialist use.Gas pressure washers, on the other hand, are gas-powered machines that are commonly used by professional pressure washing services. Gas pressure washers are more expensive \\u2014 usually at a price point above $300 \\u2014 heavier, noisier and bulkier than electric pressure washers. They\\u2019re also more powerful than electric machines, making them a more efficient option for large surfaces with tough stains and dirt like decks, concrete and siding, and they don\\u2019t require a power outlet. But Steckel warned that the intensity of gas pressure washers can ultimately do more harm than good by stripping away paint and other material. He recommended sticking to an electric pressure washer if you\\u2019re looking to do casual maintenance at home or if you aren\\u2019t a power tools professional.A pressure washer\\u2019s specific features can determine its strength and reliability when cleaning different types of outdoor surfaces. Depending on the pressure washer you get and its adjustability, you can clean several spots: fences, decks, cars, windows, boats, patio furniture and the list goes on. When shopping for a pressure washer, experts recommend considering the following features:Pounds per square inch (PSI): Used to measure the water pressure and a water stream's ability to strip away debris, the PSI varies by type of pressure washer. The higher a pressure washer's PSI, the more powerful the water pressure is.Gallons per minute (GPM): This refers to the water flow from the machine\\u2019s unit to the nozzle and has to do with the rinsing power that washes dirt away. The higher the GPM, the faster the pressure washer will rinse away debris.Nozzle size: The size of the nozzle determines the pressure and spread of the water. According to Carson, nozzles typically come in four or five sizes and \\u201Cthe smaller the nozzle, the more power you will get.\\u201D You can buy nozzles individually, which range from a 0-degree to a 65-degree size. The narrower a nozzle, the more powerful the water stream. And while a wider nozzle uses less pressure, the spread is wider, which can make the job faster if the stains aren\\u2019t too tough. \\u201CMake sure you avoid zero-degree nozzles unless you are a professional \\u2014 these have a higher chance of causing damage to surfaces and even injury,\\u201D suggested Carson.Adjustable wands: This accessory lets you adjust the spray width or the water pressure of your machine without changing the nozzle each time.Portability: Electric pressure washers typically weigh between 15 and more than 60 pounds, while many gas-powered pressure washers weigh well over 100 pounds, so wheels will make transporting the machine onto cars and boats easier.Detergent tanks: Pressure washers can feature an on-board detergent tank, which holds a cleaning solution that\\u2019s pressurized with the water and released through the spray gun with the touch of a switch. If the pressure washer doesn\\u2019t come with a detergent tank, you can use a siphoning hose to mix the detergent in with the water. However, Carson noted to never use bleach through your pressure washer since it can ruin and break your machine.Keeping in mind the guidance from home cleaning experts, we compiled the best pressure washers to consider using on your outdoor space.This electric pressure washer from RYOBI is a medium-duty machine with 2,300 PSI, 1.2 GPM and a built-in detergent tank for powerful and routine cleaning. It includes a brushless induction motor, which is typically quieter and lasts longer than the universal motors on pressure washers. However, it does weigh 49 pounds, making it heavier than other typical electric pressure washers. If you do hope to move it around, its large wheels and 25-foot high-pressure hose makes it easy to transport to different areas of your outdoor space. RYOBI also offers a 3-year limited warranty to repair and replace damaged parts.This heavy-duty Simpson power washer is a powerful and durable option for professional use, with a steel frame and 4,400 PSI. It includes a flexible 50-foot-long hose and a 31-inch spray wand for tackling hard-to-reach places, and comes with five different nozzles, from a zero-degree nozzle to a gentle soap nozzle. Simpson\\u2019s manufacturer warranty includes a five-year pump warranty, a three-year Simpson engine warranty and a 90-day accessory warranty.This one from RYOBI is a more affordable option compared to most pressure washers \\u2014 priced at under $100 \\u2014 and is lightweight, weighing a little over 16 pounds. The handle at the top of the machine makes it a portable option for using inside a car or a boat. It includes three nozzles: a 15-degree nozzle, a soap nozzle and a one-fourth-inch turbo nozzle that, according to the brand, makes cleaning up to 50 percent faster.Designed for professional use, the DEWALT gas-powered pressure washer features 13-inch premium tires that can withstand frequent use on difficult terrain, a tough steel frame that resists corrosion and 4,000 PSI. The brand claims its flexible 50-foot steel-braided hose resists abrasion three times more than rubber. The DEWALT pressure washer also includes an adjustable unloader, which sends pressurized water flow through the bypass and fine-tunes the pressure of the machine to accommodate certain jobs.With a 4.5-star average rating from more than 29,000 reviews on Amazon, this bestselling machine from Sun Joe is both portable and powerful, generating up to 2,030 PSI. It includes two removable on-board detergent tanks that hold 0.9 liters of cleaning solution, a 34-inch wand and a 20-foot-long high-pressure hose. This pressure washer also features a Total Stop System designed by the brand to automatically shut off the pump when the trigger isn\\u2019t being held to both save energy and help the pump last longer.While pressure washers have several uses, they can be extremely dangerous if used improperly. Carson suggested \\u201Cwearing long sleeves, pants, boots, gloves and goggles when operating the machine to mitigate the chance of injury.\\u201D Steckel added to keep the pressurized water away from your body since it can definitely \\u201Cbreak skin.\\\" He also mentioned to avoid using one while on a ladder due to safety concerns.For initial pressure washing \\u2014 especially after a long winter of minimal outdoor maintenance \\u2014 Steckel suggested hiring professionals to avoid having to purchase an expensive and intense machine.\\u201CThe best way to do it is to set yourself up for success and start with a clean slate,\\u201D said Steckel. \\u201CA pro comes in with a super intense gas-powered washer and brings you back to essentially brand new by removing a single micro millimeter, and they're quite accurate.\\u201D Afterward, buying a less expensive electric pressure washer makes the cleaning \\u201Creally easy for you to maintain on a seasonal basis.\\u201DExperts also recommend testing the pressure settings in a safe and discreet area before utilizing it on your desired surface. Steckel suggested starting your pressure washing early to avoid using the machine near a freshly planted garden or flower bed, but not too early where heavy rain can cause your surfaces to be muddy again quickly.UPDATE (April 9, 2021, 12:30 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article included the Greenworks 1500 PSI Electric Pressure Washer. After the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announced April 9 that the same pressure washer had been recalled due to safety concerns, mention of it has been removed from the article.Catch up on the latest from NBC News Shopping guides and recommendations and download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak.Mili Godio is an SEO editorial assistant for NBC News Shopping."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"8 fun outdoor games to play with the family 2021","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/shopping\/lifestyle\/best-outdoor-games-n1263954","content":"Our editors independently selected these items because we think you will enjoy them and might like them at these prices.

Overall, the experts we consulted agree that jump roping offers cardio health benefits and allows you to torch plenty of calories in a relatively short amount of time and with fitness equipment that\\u2019s relatively affordable.\\u201CJump roping is extremely effective at burning fat, particularly at our core,\\u201D explained Roy Oommen, MD, a cardiothoracic surgeon (specializing in heart and chest surgery). He told us that jump roping \\u201Cis all that is needed for a great workout.\\u201D The nonprofit American Heart Association recommends adults partake in 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, like jump roping, each week. In fact, jump roping burns approximately 15 to 20 calories per minute, according to board-certified orthopedic surgeon Marc S. Kowalsky, MD \\u2014 and online calculators from Calories Burned HQ and ACE Fitness can even help you gauge how many calories you burn specifically while jump roping.The two most important factors of a jump rope are its length and weight, according to John Gallucci, Jr., CEO of JAG-ONE Physical Therapy.Use a jump rope that is 3 feet longer than your height, advised Gallucci, the former head athletic trainer of the New York Red Bulls MLS team. Step on the middle of the jump rope and pull it taut, and the point at which the cable meets each handle should hit around the breast on your upper chest.You also have the choice of three types of jump ropes: basic, weighted and speed.You can find jump ropes at Shopping reader-favorite retailers like Walmart, Target and Dick\\u2019s Sporting Goods \\u2014 you can find affordable and highly rated jump ropes for $4. The experts we consulted shared with us their recommendations across price points and use cases.Roy and Donlan are both fans of Crossrope\\u2019s Lean jump rope, which can sync with Apple Health and Google Fit. You have the ability to swap out the handles to upgrade your jump rope from Light (0.25 pounds) to Heavy (0.5 pounds). Roy also appreciates the ergonomic, texturized handles and finds the jump rope doesn\\u2019t tangle like others. It boasts a 4.8-star average rating from 2,990 reviews on Amazon.This is Gallucci\\u2019s favorite jump rope for beginners since it helps users \\u201Cget a feel for the rhythm of jumping and how to do it properly.\\u201D He noted the weighted jump rope is great for engaging arm muscles. It earned a 4.3-star average rating from nearly 250 reviews on Amazon.Gallucci also recommended Lifeline\\u2019s speed jump rope for those who want \\u201Ca killer workout\\u201D and to \\u201Cgo at maximum speed and build endurance.\\u201D It weighs just 0.75 pounds and received a 4-star average rating from more than 150 reviews on Amazon.One highly-rated PVC jump rope worth considering is from EliteSRS. It has a 4.4-star average from more than 330 reviews on Amazon and is height-adjustable. After measuring the correct height, pull part of the 10-foot cord through one of the handles, release the attached lock and once you have the right length, snap the lock back in place (and use scissors to snip any excess cord poking out). The jump rope is available in six colorways, ranging from Pink\\\/Purple to Silver\\\/White.This jump rope is the No. 1 bestseller on Amazon and it boasts a 4.3-star average rating from more than 35,200 reviews. The 9-foot jump rope is height adjustable and covered with PVC that\\u2019s designed to help prevent floor damage. It also features ergonomic memory foam handles.Morten Mueller, a performance coach at personal training service Future, said two of the most common mistakes his clients make with jump roping are overexerting themselves and jumping too high. \\u201CThe rope is all about rhythm and coordination for sustained periods. If we jump too high, we will have a hard time replicating the almost same technique over and over again and might even have to stop early,\\u201D he said. Mueller noted that jumping too high also limits the cardio benefits of jump roping and can cause joint stress to your lower body. \\u201CThink rhythm first, duration second and height last.\\u201DMueller also shared three simple steps to help you get started with jump roping:Nicole Saunders is the associate commerce editor at NBC News Shopping, covering wellness and lifestyle."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Covid eye protection isn't required but 'doesn't hurt,' experts say","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/shopping\/wellness\/best-coronavirus-eye-protection-n1263834","content":"Our editors independently selected these items because we think you will enjoy them and might like them at these prices.

While rare, Yuna Rapoport, MD, founder and director of Manhattan Eye, said our eyes are an entry point for viral particles and can be a channel through which we become infected with Covid-19. But does that mean we should wear eye protection to school, work and the grocery store?\\u201CI don\\u2019t think we need to routinely wear glasses, goggles or face shields like we need to wear masks,\\u201D said Rapoport. \\u201CBut then again, it doesn't hurt to wear protective eyewear, either.\\u201DThomas Steinemann, MD, spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and professor of ophthalmology at MetroHealth Medical Center, said there have been a few studies about wearing eye protection as a Covid-19 mitigation measure. One of the most prominent ones is a study published in the medical journal JAMA Ophthalmology in September 2020. It examined whether or not there\\u2019s an association between people wearing eyeglasses daily and their susceptibility to the coronavirus. The study, which examined 276 individuals hospitalized with Covid-19 in Suizhou, China, found that the proportion of daily eyeglass wearers \\u2014 those who wore eyeglasses for more than eight hours a day \\u2014 was just 5.8 percent, while the number of local individuals who wore eyeglasses daily was 31.5 percent. Steinemann said the study suggests that daily wearers of eyeglasses may be less susceptible to Covid-19. But he thinks more studies need to be done around the topic in order to make public health recommendations.\\u201CI think the study is fascinating and it\\u2019s compelling for more studies, but it\\u2019s just one small observational study,\\u201D Steinemann said. \\u201CI don\\u2019t want people to lose sleep over it.\\u201DThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently only recommends eye protection for healthcare professionals in \\u201Careas with moderate to substantial community transmission\\u201D As for the rest of us, Rapoport and Steinemann said recommendations for wearing eye protection are situational. We talked to medical experts about when we may want to wear eye protection during the pandemic, and the types of eye protection we may want to consider.The CDC states that it \\u201Cdoes not recommend face shields or goggles as a substitute for masks,\\u201D but it notes that goggles or other eye protection may be used in addition to a mask. Face shields and goggles are primarily used to protect the eyes of the person wearing them, the CDC says.Steinemann said the three types of eyewear he recommends are goggles, safety glasses and face shields. Overall, he noted that you should look for eyewear that creates a seal around the eyes in order to eliminate gaps where particles could get in.Rapoport said goggles are very protective, and when she saw Covid-19 patients in the hospital early on in the pandemic, she wore a pair. If you look at pictures of people who are on the frontlines, she said they often wear goggles in addition to masks, gowns, gloves and other personal protective equipment.Safety glasses are another, more inconspicuous option, especially if you plan to wear them to run errands in crowded public spaces or travel on public transportation. The safety glasses should have barriers on the tops and sides, and look for glasses that have a seal (usually made from foam or rubber) around the inside of the frames.Face shields are another option, which, as we previously reported, can block large particulates from getting into your eyes and mouth. On top of its caution against replacing masks with face shields, the CDC notes that \\u201Cface shields have large gaps below and alongside the face where respiratory droplets may escape and reach others around you.\\u201DThese safety glasses are designed with side and top shields to protect your eyes from airborne particles. They\\u2019re made from polycarbonate, a lightweight, shatterproof material, and block UV rays. The lenses feature an anti-fog coating and anti-glare lenses for better visibility, and the brand states that they\\u2019re blue light blocking (although experts previously told us that blue light glasses with clear lenses are minimally effective). The glasses come in a variety of colors, including Tortoise, Black, Blue and Red, and they can be purchased individually or in a pack of two. The safety glasses are also available for kids.The inside of these glasses\\u2019 frames are lined with foam padding to create a seal around the eyes. The glasses feature curved lenses that wrap around to protect the sides of the eyes, as well as create a secure fit. The lenses are constructed from scratch-resistant polycarbonate and have an anti-fog coating. They provide UVA, UVB and UVC protection as well. The glasses come in five styles: two with Clear lenses, two with Dark Grey lenses and one designed for indoor and outdoor use.Dewalt\\u2019s safety goggles feature a soft, dual rubber lining around the inner frames that conforms to the face, creating a seal around the eyes. The goggles have an adjustable elastic headband, and the shatter- and scratch-resistant lenses are made with an anti-fog lens coating. The goggles are available with Clear or Smoke lenses.SolidWork\\u2019s safety goggles are built with a rubber lining around the inner frames to provide a seal around the eyes. The glasses feature a panoramic lens design to offer full side vision while protecting the eyes against particles. The lenses have a coating that makes them scratch-resistant on the outside and fog-free on the inside, and they also provide protection against UV rays.This one-size-fits-all face shield features acrylic glasses that can fit over most eyeglasses. The anti-fog shield offers 180-degree protection around the face as well as full visibility. The face shields come in a pack of 10, and they can be cleaned and reused.This full-length face shield provides coverage over the face, and its wrap-around design offers protection from particles, too. It\\u2019s designed with a foam strip that rests on the forehead and an adjustable elastic band headband. Its visor can be cleaned and reused. The face shield comes in a pack of two.Like our mouth and nose, our eyes have a mucous membrane through which viruses can enter the body, according to Steinemann. The eyes\\u2019 mucus membrane is connected to those of the nose and mouth, which he said people usually understand if they think about how their nose gets stuffy when they cry. Steinemann said it\\u2019s less common to contract the coronavirus through the eyes because their surface area is smaller than that of the nose and mouth, which makes it harder for airborne virus particles to enter the eyes.Rapoport said people infected with the coronavirus can also spread the disease through their tears. If you touch tears that carry the coronavirus (or a surface where the tears landed) and then touch your eyes, you may become infected with Covid-19 by spreading the virus to your body. Additionally, you can contract the coronavirus by touching your eyes after touching a surface that has virus particles on it. While possible, she emphasized that it\\u2019s uncommon.Rapoport said you should \\u201Cabsolutely wear eye protection\\u201D if you\\u2019re a caregiver for an actively infected individual who lives in your home, or if you suspect someone may be infected. She said you should take every precaution when you\\u2019re in close contact with them, including wearing eye protection.Additionally, if you\\u2019re taking public transportation and are on a crowded flight, train or bus, Steinemann said to consider wearing eye protection. The same goes for people gathering in crowded public spaces and for those who are at high risk of severe Covid-19 illness: the more protection, the better.\\u201CI think it\\u2019s entirely appropriate to be as cautious as possible in these situations,\\u201D Steinemann said. He also noted that eye protection can serve as a reminder to not touch your eyes and face.Catch up on the latest from NBC News Shopping guides and recommendations and download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak.Zoe Malin is a digital editorial intern for NBC News Shopping."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"The 7 best outdoor dog beds of 2021","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/shopping\/pets\/best-outdoor-dog-beds-n1262554","content":"Our editors independently selected these items because we think you will enjoy them and might like them at these prices.

These crystals could change that.","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/science\/environment\/solar-panels-are-reaching-limit-crystals-change-rcna545","content":"When the Biden administration announced in late March a $128 million initiative to improve the costs of solar power, a significant chunk of the money went to research into materials named after an obscure 19th century Russian geologist and nobleman: Lev Perovski.Among the projects listed: $40 million for research and development into so-called perovskite materials that scientists are using to push the limits of just how efficient and adaptable solar cells can be. And while perovskites aren't anything new \\u2014 they were first found in Russia\\u2019s Ural Mountains in 1839, and they are relatively common \\u2014 their more recent applications in solar power technology has sparked hope that humans will use them to better harness the thousands of megawatts of energy from the sun that falls on Earth every hour.\\u201CPerovskites, I would argue, are one of the most exciting opportunities for solar cells in the immediate future,\\u201D said David Mitzi, a professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Duke University, who has studied the materials since the 1990s. Any new solar power technology had to compete with silicon solar cells, an entrenched technology used for more than 50 years, Mitzi said. But perovskites had the potential to both enhance the efficiencies of silicon cells, and perhaps to compete with them directly: \\u201CI think there definitely are opportunities.\\u201DEfficiency is just one of the features. Perovskite cells can be easily manufactured into a variety of electricity-generating materials, and at much lower temperatures \\u2014 and therefore potentially lower costs \\u2014 than silicon cells. But the stability and durability of perovskite cells will have to be addressed before they can entirely replace silicon.Scientists have now discovered a whole class of perovskite materials that share a specific structure, incorporating three different chemicals within a cubic crystal shape. They recognized years ago that some perovskites were semiconductors, like the silicon used in electronics. But it was only in 2009 that researchers found perovskites could also be used to build solar cells, which turn sunlight into usable electricity.The first perovskite cells had very low efficiencies, so most of the sunlight that fell on them wasn\\u2019t used. But they\\u2019ve rapidly improved. \\u201CThe efficiency with which solar cells that have these perovskite materials convert sunlight to electrons has increased at a really incredible rate, to the extent that now the efficiencies are close to those of silicon solar cells in the lab,\\u201D said Lynn Loo, a professor of chemical engineering at Princeton University and the director of the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment. \\u201CThat's why we are so excited about this class of materials.\\\"Perovskite solar cells can also be made relatively easily \\u2013 unlike silicon cells, which need to be refined at very high temperatures and so need a lot of energy to make. Perovskites can be made as thin sheets at low temperatures, or as inks that can effectively be \\u201Cprinted\\u201D onto substrates of other materials, such as flexible rolls of plastic. That could lead to their use on surfaces where silicon solar cells wouldn\\u2019t be practical, such as the exteriors of cars or trucks; or they might even be printed onto cloth to power wearable electronics. Another possibility is to apply thin films of perovskites to the glass of windows, where they\\u2019d let through most of the light while using a part of it to generate electricity.But one of the most promising uses of perovskite cells is to combine them with silicon cells so that they use more of the sun\\u2019s energy than silicon alone. The best silicon cells are approaching their theoretical maximum efficiency of about 29 percent. But perovskite cells can be tuned to generate electricity from wavelengths of light that silicon cells don\\u2019t use \\u2013 and so covering silicon solar cells with semi-transparent films of perovskite cells could overcome that fundamental limit.Physicist Henry Snaith at the University of Oxford, a leading researcher in perovskite solar cells, sees this as a way to combine the industrial dominance of silicon with the technological advantages of perovskites. He thinks \\u201Ctandem\\u201D silicon and perovskite cells with efficiencies above 40 percent efficiency could be commercially widespread within 10 years, and that they could soon be followed by multilayered cells with efficiencies of over 50 percent.The potential of perovskite solar panels has also caught government attention, both here and overseas. As well as creating new commercial opportunities for U.S. companies, perovskites could become a relatively inexpensive way for solar power to challenge fossil fuels for generating electricity. \\u201CI think a lot of us have aspirations for the technology to really begin to address some of the climate change issues that need to be handled by 2050,\\u201D said physicist Joe Berry, who leads research into solar perovskites at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado.Perovskite solar cells still face problems, however, and key among these is the issue of stability. In part because they\\u2019re easy to make, perovskite cells also degrade quickly from humidity and heat. Some experimental perovskite cells have stayed stable for tens of thousands of hours, but they still have a long way to go to meet the 25 or 30 years of use of silicon cells, Snaith said.Some of the most promising perovskite materials for solar power also incorporate lead, which can be released into the environment when the perovskite cells degrade. Researchers are studying alternatives to lead-based perovskites, such as tin-based perovskites, and similar crystal structures that incorporate other, safer substances. \\u201CI think there are some challenges ahead,\\u201D Loo said. \\u201CWhether [perovskites] are going to play a significant role depends on whether we can overcome these challenges.\\\"  Tom Metcalfe writes about science and space for NBC News."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Biden pressed on emissions goal as climate summit nears","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/science\/environment\/biden-pressed-emissions-goal-climate-summit-nears-rcna708","content":"When President Joe Biden convenes a virtual climate summit on Thursday, he faces a vexing task: how to put forward a nonbinding but symbolic goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that will have a tangible impact on climate change efforts not only in the U.S. but throughout the world.The emissions target, eagerly awaited by all sides of the climate debate, will signal how aggressively Biden wants to move on climate change, a divisive and expensive issue that has riled Republicans to complain about job-killing government overreach even as some on the left worry Biden has not gone far enough to address a profound threat to the planet.The climate crisis poses a complex political challenge for Biden, since the problem is harder to see and far more difficult to produce measurable results on than either the coronavirus pandemic relief package or the infrastructure bill.The target Biden chooses \\u201Cis setting the tone for the level of ambition and the pace of emission reductions over the next decade,\\u2033 said Kate Larsen, a former White House adviser who helped develop President Barack Obama\\u2019s climate action plan.The number has to be achievable by 2030 but aggressive enough to satisfy scientists and advocates who call the coming decade a crucial, make-or-break moment for slowing climate change, Larsen and other experts said.Scientists, environmental groups and even business leaders are calling on Biden to set a target that would cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.The 50 percent target, which most experts consider a likely outcome of intense deliberations underway at the White House, would nearly double the nation\\u2019s previous commitment and require dramatic changes in the power and transportation sectors, including significant increases in renewable energy such as wind and solar power and steep cuts in emissions from fossil fuels such as coal and oil.Anything short of that goal could undermine Biden\\u2019s promise to prevent temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, experts say, while likely stirring up sharp criticism from international allies and Biden\\u2019s own supportersThe target is significant, not just as a visible goal for the U.S. to achieve after four years of climate inaction under President Donald Trump, but also for \\u201Cleveraging other countries,\\u2033 Larsen said. \\u201CThat helps domestically in the battle that comes after, which is implementing policies to achieve that target. We can make a better case politically at home if other countries are acting at the same level of ambition as the U.S.\\u2033The 2030 goal, known as a Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC, is a key part of the Paris climate agreement, which Biden rejoined on his first day in office. It\\u2019s also an important marker as Biden moves toward his ultimate goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\\u201CClearly the science demands at least 50 percent\\u201D in reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, said Jake Schmidt, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a leading environmental group.The 50 percent target \\u201Cis ambitious, but it is achievable,\\u2033 he said in an interview. It\\u2019s also a good climate message, he said: \\u201CPeople know what 50 percent means \\u2014 it\\u2019s half.\\u2033Whatever target Biden picks, the climate summit itself \\u201Cproves the U.S. is back in rejoining the international effort\\u2033 to address climate change, said Larsen, now a director at the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm.The summit is \\u201Cthe starting gun for climate diplomacy\\u201D after a four-year \\u201Chiatus\\u201D under Trump, she said. John Kerry, Biden\\u2019s climate envoy, has been pressing global leaders in person and online ahead of the summit for commitments and alliances on climate efforts.Nathaniel Keohane, another former Obama White House adviser and now a vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund, said experts have coalesced around the need to reduce emissions by at least 50 percent by 2030.\\u201CThe number has to start with 5,\\u201D he said, adding, \\u201CWe\\u2019ve done the math. We need at least 50 percent.\\u2033The 2030 target is just one in a sometimes overlapping set of goals that Biden has outlined on climate. He also has said he expects to adopt a clean energy standard that would make electricity carbon-free by 2035, along with the wider goal of net-zero carbon emissions economy-wide by 2050.Biden\\u2019s climate adviser, Gina McCarthy, acknowledged that the sheer volume of numbers can be confusing. At a forum last week, she and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said climate activists should focus on actions in the next decade.\\u201CLet\\u2019s stop talking about 2050,\\u2033 said McCarthy, who is leading White House efforts to develop U.S. climate commitments for 2030.Bloomberg, 79, was even more blunt: 2050 \\u201Cis a good number for people who give speeches, but I don\\u2019t know anyone giving those speeches who\\u2019s going to be alive in 2050.\\u2033Some Republican lawmakers call the focus on reducing U.S. emissions counter-productive, saying Biden\\u2019s plan would raise energy costs and kill American jobs while allowing Russia, China and other countries to increase greenhouse gas emissions.\\u201CThe Biden administration will set punishing targets for the United States, while our adversaries keep the status quo. That won\\u2019t solve climate change,\\u2033 said Sen. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy Committee. The United States already leads the world in reducing carbon emissions, Barrasso said, adding that Biden should try to \\u201Cmake American energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising costs for consumers.\\u201DSome on the left think Biden is not going far enough.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat who has called for a massive Green New Deal, said Biden deserves \\u201Ca lot of credit\\u201D for his infrastructure plan\\u2019s vision and scope, but said it falls far short of what is needed to meaningfully combat the climate crisis. She and her supporters are calling for at least $10 trillion in federal spending over the next decade to address climate change and other problems.McCarthy disputed the notion that Biden has backtracked from campaign promises to lead on climate.\\u201CWe\\u2019re always either doing too little or too much,\\u2033 she told reporters earlier this month. \\u201CBut rest assured that the president put a (spending) number out here that he felt was not just defensible but required to meet this moment in time.\\u2033Much of the proposed spending to address climate change is included in Biden\\u2019s $2.3 trillion infrastructure bill.If Republicans think less money should be spent on clean energy and infrastructure, McCarthy added, \\u201Cthen we\\u2019ll have those conversations.\\u201DMarcella Burke, a former Trump administration official who now is an energy lawyer in Houston, gives Biden an \\u201CA-Plus for enthusiasm\\u201D on climate, but an incomplete on details. \\u201CWe\\u2019ve had a lot of goals, but not a lot of strategy announced to get there,\\u2033 she said. \\u201CSo the jury is still out.\\u2033"},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Feuds set aside as U.S. and China agree to cooperate on climate change","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/world\/feuds-set-aside-u-s-china-agree-cooperate-climate-change-n1264419","content":"They have feuded recently over Hong Kong, the treatment the Uighur community and future of Taiwan, but the U.S. and China can agree on one thing \\u2014 the fight against climate change.Ahead of President Joe Biden's summit of world leaders to address the issue this week, the world's two biggest greenhouse gas emitters \\\"committed to cooperating with each other and with other countries\\\" to tackle the issue, a joint statement from the State Department and China\\u2019s Ministry of Ecology and Environment said late Saturday.The agreement between Washington and Beijing was reached by John Kerry, the U.S. special envoy for climate, and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua during two days of talks in Shanghai last week, the statement said.The United States and China are \\\"to tackle the climate crisis, which must be addressed with the seriousness and urgency that it demands,\\u201D it added.Together, they agreed to discuss specific emission reduction actions to decarbonize industry and power, including energy storage, carbon capture and green hydrogen, as well as increasing use of renewable energy, reducing emissions from coal, oil, and gas, and addressing emissions from international aviation, the statement added.China is the world\\u2019s biggest carbon emitter, followed by the United States, and the statement said discussions had also focused on the need to maximise financing for developing countries to switch to low-carbon and renewable energy.Biden made climate one of his key commitments in last year\\u2019s election campaign, pledging that the U.S. will achieve net-zero emissions no later than 2050.He rejoined the 2015 Paris climate accord, a global pact to curb emissions, on the first day of his presidency.

Bezos also owns the Washington Post.The U.S. space agency made the announcement of the contract for the first commercial human lander, part of NASA's as part of the Artemis program, in a video conference. NASA said the lander will carry the two American astronauts to the lunar surface.\\\"We should accomplish the next landing as soon as possible,\\\" said Steve Jurczyk, NASA's acting administrator. \\\"This is an incredible time to be involved in human exploration, for all humanity.\\\"\\\"If they hit their milestones we have a shot at 2024,\\\" Jurczyk added.NASA said it would require a test flight to the moon before humans make the flight.\\\"In addition, NASA is requiring a test flight to fully check out all systems with a landing on the lunar surface prior to our formal demonstration mission,\\\" NASA official Lisa Watson-Morgan told reporters.NASA official Mark Kirasich said the agency hopes to see all three of the companies that competed for the initial moon landing vying to provide recurring transportation to the moon.\\\"We have to be able to provide for recurring lunar services,\\\" said Kirasich, deputy associate administrator for NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems division, adding that NASA will work on a follow-on competition for \\\"regularly recurring\\\" lunar missions.The NASA announcement added to an extraordinary run for Musk, who is one of the world's richest people thanks to his 22 percent stake in electric car maker Tesla.Tesla has become the world's most-valuable automaker, with a market capitalization of $702 billion, far surpassing the auto industry's giants. Musk has become a one-person technology conglomerate, launching or controlling companies pursuing space flight, electric cars, neural implants and subterranean tunnel boring.A factor in the choice of SpaceX was \\\"what's the best value to the government,\\\" said Kathy Lueders, associate administrator for NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate.NASA said in a news release that SpaceX's HLS Starship, designed to land on the moon, \\\"leans on the company's tested Raptor engines and flight heritage of the Falcon and Dragon vehicles.\\\" It said Starship includes a spacious cabin and two airlocks for astronaut moon walks and that its architecture is intended to evolve to a fully reusable launch and landing system designed for travel to the Moon, Mars and other destinations in space.NASA's decision was a setback for Bezos, a lifelong space enthusiast and one of the world's richest people, who is now more focused on his space venture after having announced in February he would step down as Amazon CEO.The contract was seen by Bezos and other executives as vital to Blue Origin establishing itself as a desired partner for NASA, and also putting the venture on the road to turning a profit, Reuters had reported in February.SpaceX announced on Wednesday it had raised about $1.16 billion in equity financing.Musk has outlined an ambitious agenda for SpaceX and its reusable rockets, including landing humans on Mars. But in the near term, SpaceX's main business has been launching satellites for Musk's Starlink internet venture, and other satellites and space cargo.Unlike the Apollo lunar landings from 1969 to 1972, NASA now is gearing up for a long-term presence on the moon that it envisions as a steppingstone to an even more ambitious plan to send astronauts to reach Mars. NASA is leaning heavily on private companies built around shared visions for space exploration.An uncrewed SpaceX Starship prototype rocket failed to land safely on March 30 after a test launch from Boca Chica, Texas. The Starship was one in a series of prototypes for the heavy-lift rocket being developed by SpaceX to carry humans and 100 tons of cargo on future missions to the moon and Mars.

If there were 2.5 million T. rex instead of 2.5 billion, we would probably have never known they existed, he said.Marshall\\u2019s team calculated the population by using a general biology rule of thumb that says the bigger the animal, the less dense its population. Then they added estimates of how much energy the carnivorous T. rex needed to stay alive \\u2014 somewhere between a Komodo dragon and a lion. The more energy required, the less dense the population. They also factored in that the T. rex reached sexual maturity somewhere around 14 to 17 years old and lived at most 28 years.Given uncertainties in the creatures\\u2019 generation length, range and how long they roamed, the Berkeley team said the total population could be as little as 140 million or as much as 42 billion with 2.4 billion as the middle value.The science about the biggest land-living carnivores of all time is important, \\u201Cbut the truth, as I see it, is that this kind of thing is just very cool,\\u201D said Purdue University geology professor James Farlow."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Covid-19 booster shot likely needed within 12 months, Pfizer's CEO says","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/science\/science-news\/covid-19-booster-shot-likely-needed-12-months-pfizers-ceo-says-rcna692","content":"People are likely to need a third dose of a Covid-19 vaccine within a year of getting fully vaccinated and may subsequently need annual shots to protect against the coronavirus, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said Thursday.Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech, are studying how long the vaccines' protective immunity will last.

Hardin\\u2019s face as he watched 61-year-old Charles McMillian weep while testifying in the murder trial connected to George Floyd's death. He couldn\\u2019t help it: As a Black man, Hardin said he felt McMillian\\u2019s pain.More than a week later, Hardin watched as Floyd\\u2019s brother Philonise broke down on the witness stand when describing his relationship with his older sibling who died last Memorial Day weekend after then-Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for about nine minutes.Hardin cried again.His emotions watching the trial and viewing the video of Chauvin\\u2019s knee on Floyd\\u2019s neck were representative of the trauma many Black men of various ages and locations across America felt during the trial after several weeks of sometimes-riveting testimony.Some found it difficult to watch. Some found it unbearable to watch. Some could not watch at all.\\u201CWe need to watch it,\\u201D Hardin, an entrepreneur and former city councilman in Salisbury, North Carolina, said. \\u201CCovering our eyes or turning away from the TV and being unwilling to feel raw emotions about it is detrimental to us.\\u201D\\\"We can\\u2019t get so desensitized to it and we can\\u2019t get so emotionally wrought that we turn away from it,\\\" he said. \\\"We have to embrace everything and use it as motivation to help make this stuff stop.\\\"Hardin has three adult sons. \\u201CI picture how I would feel if they were victimized like that.

Where is the progress?\\u201D\\\"Charles McMillian cried on the stand because he stood on the side as George Floyd was being handled and told him, 'You can\\u2019t win. You can\\u2019t win.' What he was saying was, 'George, stop. You can\\u2019t beat the system,'\\\" Hardin said. \\\"And the systemic racism in this country beat McMillian down to the point where he knew what the end result would be.\\\"Kennard Johnson, 21, said he watched the trial \\u201Cin bits and pieces\\u201D because of work but also because he did not want to relive the trauma and lose control of his emotions.\\\"My friends, my peers and I talk about it and it\\u2019s too emotional,\\\" said Johnson, who works in banking in Omaha, Nebraska. \\\"But the truth is, I don\\u2019t like talking about it.

Her police chief, Tim Gannon, said he thought she intended to use a stun gun on Wright during a traffic stop but mistakenly fired her service weapon. Wright died, and Potter and Gannon resigned a day before Potter was charged with second-degree manslaughter.\\u201CIf you\\u2019re Black in this country, especially a Black man, you can\\u2019t help but be emotional about this stuff. We are targets. That\\u2019s the painful reality,\\u201D Johnson said.Rodney Coates, a sociologist focusing on social justice and social policy at Miami University in Ohio, said the pain he and other Black men feel is visceral, originating from a history of abuse.\\\"This whole case is symbolic of the past,\\\" Coates said. \\\"I have intentionally tried to not watch the trial and the video. It brings me back to the middle passage and how horrific that was. America has consistently targeted the Black male. Derek Chauvin is not on trial. The American justice system is on trial.\\\"\\\"As Black men, we want affirmation that our lives matter,\\\" Coates continued. \\\"I am George Floyd. I am the people who were there watching his life seep out of him after he pleaded for his mother. All of these images are traumatic.\\\"White, the engineer, said the pain of the visual is magnified by the notion that there likely will be another Black man needlessly killed by law enforcement. Worse, he added, is that there are not enough people who feel the Black man\\u2019s hurt.\\\"Racism today is more cerebral,\\\" White said. \\\"It\\u2019s not the KKK burning down your house. But it\\u2019s cases like this, where people believe it\\u2019s acceptable for a \\u2018good white man to harm and kill a bad Black man.\\u2019 We\\u2019re always the \\u2018bad\\u2019 guy.\\\"\\\"When they have that mentality, they put George Floyd on trial,\\\" White continued. \\\"And when they do that, they put all Black men on trial. If you\\u2019re a Black man, you know this could happen to you \\u2014 and no one could be held accountable for it. And that\\u2019s unacceptable.\\\"Coates agreed: \\u201CThis is all a form of white privilege. Their position is \\u2018It doesn\\u2019t impact me. It\\u2019s not my kids being killed.

Whether you\\u2019re looking to improve leg and core strength or raise your heart rate, mountain climbers are a move that will get it done.However, maintaining proper form is key to performing the exercise correctly and getting the most out of it, while keeping yourself safe.Mountain climbers target many major muscle groups, including the abs, lower back, hamstrings and glutes. Strong glutes and core muscles help us maintain upright posture, and mountain climbers are the perfect move to strengthen both these areas.Although mountain climbers are high intensity and help raise your heart rate, they\\u2019re also low impact. Low-impact exercises are great for people who suffer with joint pain. However, it\\u2019s sometimes hard to find low-impact exercises that are effective at burning calories. Mountain climbers are accessible to most people and are a great move to incorporate into any workout routine.Like the plank, mountain climbers require a specific position to ensure proper performance. A lot of my clients end up arching their backs and raising their hips too high. This disengages the core and will devalue the the move, while also putting stress on the back.I also see a lot of my clients moving too quickly, bouncing on their toes as they move from foot to foot. Although going faster may feel like a more intense workout, it actually makes it more likely that you\\u2019re not properly engaging your core. To fix these mistakes:Mountain climbers require a lot of precision and full-body engagement. If you\\u2019re not there yet, there are plenty of modifications that will help you gain the confidence and strength to perform the real thing correctly.To perform a modified mountain climber, use a chair to lean on. This improves stability and decreases the intensity of the move. Place the chair in front of you. Put your hands on the seat directly below the shoulders with your arms straight. Extend your legs straight out behind you and balance on your toes; your body will be on a slight angle. Begin performing a marching movement, bringing your left leg toward your left elbow, then your right knee toward your right elbow. Continue to alternate legs and squeeze your core.Follow these step-by-step instructions to ensure you\\u2019re performing mountain climbers properly:It's common to make mistakes while performing mountain climbers, especially if you\\u2019ve never tried them before. Here are some moves that work the same muscles; try them first to build strength that will make performing climbers easier.Being able to perform a solid plank will definitely help you perform mountain climbers properly. Put your hands on the floor below your shoulders, keeping your arms straight. With your back straight and your hips low, lift your body weight up, squeezing your core. Hold this position for 10 seconds. Repeat 10 times.High knees require the same type of leg movements that mountain climbers do, but instead of being on the ground, you\\u2019ll be standing. Hold your arms out to your sides in a \\\"cactus position\\\" with your elbows bent at 90 degrees and your hands pointing up towards the ceiling. Cactus arms mimic the stationary upper body in mountain climbers, which recruits more of your core muscles. Holding your arms steady, bring one knee up towards your chest, stopping at waist height so that you\\u2019re making a 90-degree angle at the knee. Alternate your legs, keeping a quick pace. Repeat 10 times per knee.The plank jack falls in between plank and mountain climbers in terms of intensity, making for a perfect stepping stone. In plank position, begin jumping your feet out and in as if you would if you were doing a standing jumping jack. Keep your core and glutes engaged, and try not to let your hips bounce. Repeat for 10 jumps. (to modify: step each foot out to the side and back instead of jumping.)Mountain climbers require strong glutes, so performing squats beforehand will activate these muscles. Standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, bend at the hips as if you're sitting back into a chair. Stand back up squeezing the glutes at the top, and repeat. Use your glutes and abs to bring your body up and down. Repeat 10 times.Stephanie Mansour is contributing health and fitness writer for TODAY.

While there is still a pause in distribution of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are available. As more and more people receive vaccinations, experts stress that your vaccination status does not eliminate the need for mask-wearing and other safety measures.A person is not considered fully vaccinated until two weeks after receiving their second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines; and two weeks after receiving one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\\\"Until you get that second dose, you shouldn't consider yourself protected,\\\" Dr. David Dowdy, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, explained to TODAY last year, referring to the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. Dowdy added that the rollout of the vaccines will take months which means that safety precautions like social distancing and mask-wearing are still important.Short answer: Yes. In early March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released guidance on what fully vaccinated people can and cannot do. While fully vaccinated people can gather with other fully vaccinated people mask-free, in most other settings it is important to still wear a mask and stay at least 6 feet apart from others. The CDC urges fully vaccinated people to follow these precautions when in public, gathering with unvaccinated people from more than one household or visiting with an unvaccinated person who is at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19.Krystal Pollitt, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, said that there are still some unanswered questions: While the vaccines seem to prevent people from getting the disease, it's unclear if people can still be infected and transmit the virus to unvaccinated people. To date, there have been over 5,800 breakthrough infections in people who have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. The majority of those people were not hospitalized and 29% experienced asymptomatic infections.\\\"(People) may be potentially asymptomatic, with low levels of virus in their systems, and be able to spread the virus to others, even if they are vaccinated,\\\" she explained.The CDC notes that early data indicates the vaccines may help keep people from spreading COVID-19, but are learning more as more of the population becomes vaccinated.\\\"It's important to continue wearing masks,\\\" Dowdy said. \\\"People who have gotten the vaccine should be operating in much the same way as people who have not had the chance to get the vaccine, as far as trying to slow the spread of transmission of the disease.\\\"RELATED:This story was updated on April 19, 2021.Kerry Breen is a reporter and associate editor for TODAY.com, where she reports on health news, pop culture and more.

I had so many friends, and a loving family,\\u201D she told TODAY. But because of her weight, she steered clear of any physical activity as much as she could.TODAY first connected with Alexander in 2018, when she shared how she had stepped on a scale in January 2012 at age 19 and the number she saw shocked her \\u2014 306 pounds. \\u201CI knew I needed to make a change,\\u201D she said.She researched healthy eating, taught herself to cook, started exercising and began logging her calories with the MyFitnessPal app, averaging 1,200 to 1,300 calories per day. After almost two years of slow, steady progress, she lost 150 pounds. Along the way, she built a business \\u2014 Bri Healthy \\u2014 and an Instagram platform where she inspires other people to make healthy changes.At first, maintaining her weight came easy. She added 300 calories to her daily average plus a treat meal with dessert on the weekends. For years, that worked just fine.It would be nice if the story ended there. But the truth is that Alexander didn\\u2019t just hit her goal weight and settle there happily ever after. It\\u2019s been an ongoing challenge for her to maintain her weight, but her self-love has kept her grounded through the ups and downs.In 2016 she met her now-husband. \\u201CHe\\u2019s one of those people who can eat whatever he wants and stay skinny,\\u201D she said. He would eat things like processed foods and packaged cookies \\u2014 things that are engineered to be delicious. Alexander would eat them too.\\u201COnce I started to eat them, I felt like I had been missing them for a long time. Feelings of, \\u2018I can have things like this again\\u2019 popped into my mind. Anything in moderation is good. But I got a little too comfortable,\\u201D she said. Eating what worked for her husband rather than what worked for her led to weight gain.\\u201CI really started looking at myself like a failure,\\u201D she said. \\u201CMy whole journey has been \\u2018Bri Healthy.\\u2019 I\\u2019m this girl who lost all this weight and I show people that. I started to feel so disconnected from myself. I was asking, \\u2018Who did I become? How did I let myself get here?\\u2019\\u201DShe tried to lose weight again and her earlier strategies weren\\u2019t working. So she asked herself what was different. \\u201CAnd it came to me \\u2014 I was being nice to myself back then. I loved myself. I wasn\\u2019t tearing myself down,\\u201D she said. \\u201COnce I started to love myself more and put energy into that, the weight started to come off.\\u201DShe settled into a weight that was higher than her lowest weight but felt comfortable to her and healthy for her body, and maintained that weight for a long time.Alexander had been following the idea of intuitive eating and \\u201Call foods fit,\\u201D where you honor what your body wants and feed yourself what you need. She supports the idea for a lot of people, but found that it didn\\u2019t work so well for her. If she wanted a muffin, she had a muffin, but she started to want a muffin every day. Or, she would choose healthy foods during the day and then eat snacks in the evening.Her less-healthy food choices escalated during the pandemic. Plus, she started to eat a lot more takeout. And she was missing out on a lot of movement \\u2014 not only the group exercise classes she liked, but the day-to-day activity of walking and climbing stairs in New York City.A few months ago she stepped on a scale and saw that, even though her weight was under 200 pounds, it was the highest it had been since her original weight-loss success. \\u201CI wasn\\u2019t upset with myself. But I\\u2019m trying to keep in my mind my intention for being healthy,\\u201D she said.She refocused her weight-loss efforts. \\u201CI\\u2019m trying to keep myself in the mindset of knowing that I can do it and that it\\u2019s for my health,\\u201D she said. \\u201CI\\u2019m still figuring it out. And I think that there\\u2019s power in admitting that vulnerability, in the fact that we\\u2019re always all figuring it out. Life is a journey. It\\u2019s not static.\\u201DShe\\u2019s tracking her calorie intake again, aiming for 1,700 calories a day. \\u201CThat feels very freeing for me. The progress is happening slower, but I don\\u2019t feel like I\\u2019m restricting myself,\\u201D she said. She\\u2019s striking a balance between freedom and accountability.Alexander is aiming to return to her favorite weight, not her lowest weight. It\\u2019s a weight she maintained for a long time, where her clothes fit and where she feels comfortable. \\u201CIt\\u2019s where I feel nice and light and free,\\u201D she said. \\u201CI\\u2019m about 12 pounds away. It feels attainable.\\u201D\\u201CIn this journey, I\\u2019ve been loving myself where I\\u2019m at and appreciating my body where I\\u2019m at, at every level,\\u201D she said. \\u201CI am so proud that I am allowing myself to enjoy this journey, to trust the process, and to stick with it even through all of the challenges. I love learning more about myself and I know that I will find the balance I desire. It\\u2019s not always easy, but it\\u2019s always worth it.\\u201DStephanie Thurrott is a writer who covers mental health, personal growth, wellness, family, food and personal finance, and dabbles in just about any other topic that grabs her attention. When she's not writing, look for her out walking her dog or riding her bike in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley. "},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Is the COVID vaccine free? - TODAY","url":"https:\/\/www.today.com\/health\/covid-vaccine-free-today-t215538","content":"Since the beginning of the coronavirus vaccine rollout, the vaccines have been offered free of charge: People who receive a shot do not pay anything at any point.However, a survey from the U.S. Census Bureau found that as of early March nearly 7 million Americans were mistakenly \\\"concerned about the cost\\\" of the coronavirus vaccines, making it one of the more common reasons people were not planning to get vaccinated.Vaccine awareness campaigns have highlighted that there is no fee or charge associated with vaccinations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) noted in a list of frequently asked questions that the vaccine is \\\"free of charge to all people living in the United States, regardless of their immigration or health insurance status.\\\"As of April 19, anyone in the United States over the age of 16 is eligible to be vaccinated, with trials underway in younger children.\\\"The vaccine is being offered for free in order to encourage the community to take the vaccine and remove any financial impediment,\\\" Dr. Gerard Brogan, chief revenue officer for Northwell Health and professor of emergency medicine at Zucker School of Medicine in New York, said. \\\"... There is no patient responsibility for this vaccine, whether you have insurance or not.\\\"In addition to not being charged for the vaccine, people cannot be charged \\\"directly for any administration fees, copays or coinsurance\\\" or charged an \\\"office visit or other fee\\\" if the patient only receives a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the CDC. Medical providers also cannot \\\"require additional services\\\" for a person to receive a coronavirus vaccine or \\\"deny vaccination to anyone who does not have health insurance coverage, is underinsured, or is out-of-network.\\\"Brogan said that insurance information is collected because health care providers can seek reimbursement from an insurance plan or program for a \\\"vaccine administration fee,\\\" but that will not lead to a charge for the patient. If you do provide insurance, you will not be charged any portion of the bill.\\\"Whether you have insurance or not, there will be no patient billing at any point for any part of the vaccine administration,\\\" Brogan said.Brogan said that some people may receive an \\\"explanation of benefits\\\" note from their insurance if they provide that information. That document will show what was charged and what the company paid.\\\"This is a standard form that we've all seen patients get from their insurance company ... but there will be no patient responsibility of any type, whether it be a deductible, a copay, or coinsurance. Zero,\\\" Brogan said.There is also no cost associated with making a vaccine appointment. As the rollout continues, vaccine scams have popped up around the country, asking people to pay to have a vaccine appointment booked.Nenette Day, an assistant special agent in charge with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told TODAY in late March that there is \\\"no legitimate process that requires you to pay for the vaccine or to pay for a spot in order to get the vaccine.\\\"Day continued that no one should ever share payment information or other personal data while booking their vaccine appointments.\\\"You should never be entering your credit card, that's the very first thing. You shouldn't be ever entering things like 'What's your mother's maiden name,' those types of security question information. And you shouldn't be giving your Social Security account number, either.\\\"If you have questions about being vaccinated, contact your health care provider or local health department. NBC News also has a tool called Plan Your Vaccine to help every American sign up for COVID-19 vaccine alerts and stay up to date on vaccine news.Related:Kerry Breen is a reporter and associate editor for TODAY.com, where she reports on health news, pop culture and more.

This year's march is also taking place in the final days of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.The al-Aqsa mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, is located on a hilltop complex known by Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) and by Jews as the Temple Mount. Jews revere it as the location of two Biblical Temples and it is the holiest site in Judaism.The latest violence follows days of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police in the nearby Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem, with the possible eviction of Palestinian families from their homes there by Jewish settlers a focal point for Palestinian anger.Israel's Supreme Court had been due to hold a hearing in the long-running case on Monday, but the session was postponed due to the unrest.Fears had mounted that it would be a tense day in Jerusalem and so it turned out. The confrontation started first thing in the morning.As I passed the Old City walls beneath the glittering Dome of the Rock, heavily armed Israeli police had entered the compound and were firing volleys of stun grenades at Palestinians who were throwing stones and other objects at them. Ambulances screamed past ready to ferry away the wounded.The site holy to Muslims and Jews lies at the core of the region's conflict.Hundreds of Jewish activists had planned to go there in the morning, but were ultimately stopped by police. Muslim worshippers had stayed in al-Aqsa all night - ready, they said, to defend their mosque.The city's surging tensions stem from several causes. Among them, the threatened eviction of several Palestinians families from their homes in East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers.That case is now on hold for several weeks after Israel's government intervened. But despite the growing international calls for calm, today has seen more fuel poured on an already volatile mix.What happened at the al-Aqsa mosque?Israel's police force said thousands of Palestinians barricaded themselves in the building overnight with stones and Molotov cocktails in anticipation of a confrontation during the Jerusalem Day Flag March, which was scheduled to start at about 16:00 (13:00 GMT).Officers were ordered to enter the mosque compound to \\\"repel the rioters using demonstration dispersal methods\\\" on Monday morning after a police post was attacked and stones were thrown towards a nearby road, it added.For over an hour, police fired stun grenades, rubber bullets and tear gas at Palestinians, who threw stones and other objects.Video posted on social media showed crowds running for cover and some of the stun-grenade canisters landing inside the mosque.During clashes outside the Old City walls, a car was pelted with stones before crashing into bollards and hitting a man.The Palestinian Red Crescent said 305 Palestinians were injured in the clashes, and that 228 were taken to hospital for treatment. Seven of them are in a critical condition.The Israeli police force said 21 officers were injured and that three required hospital treatment.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, defended the police.\\\"This is a battle between tolerance and intolerance, between lawless violence and order,\\\" he said. \\\"Elements that want to expropriate our rights periodically force us to stand strong, like Israel's police officers are doing.\\\"Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the Israeli actions.\\\"The Israeli occupation forces' brutal storming and assault on worshippers in the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque and its courtyards is a new challenge to the international community,\\\" spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh said.Monday's flare-up follows a weekend of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police around the al-Aqsa mosque, which left hundreds of people injured.Confrontations between Palestinians and Israelis were also reported in the northern Israeli city of Haifa, and near the West Bank city of Ramallah.King Abdullah II of Jordan, which is the custodian of Jerusalem's Islamic and Christian holy sites, condemned \\\"Israeli violations and escalatory practices at the blessed al-Aqsa mosque\\\".Jordan assumed custody of the sites when it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1948 Middle East war, and was allowed to continue the role after the areas fell to Israel in 1967.The Quartet of Middle East negotiators - the US, the EU, Russia and the UN - has also expressed deep concern over the violence, urging all sides to show restraint.Why is Jerusalem a flashpoint?The city, with its sacred sites, is the most sensitive place of all in the decades-old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.Alongside its religious importance are national claims too - Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by most other countries.Palestinians claim the eastern half as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own.The hilltop compound containing the al-Aqsa mosque and buttressed by the Jewish holy site of the Western Wall is especially sensitive, with both Israel and Palestinians wary of each other's intentions and activities there.Israel says the current violence there was planned \\\"well in advance\\\" by Palestinian extremists, though a series of events has driven unrest in Jerusalem.Palestinian anger fuelled in the past few days by the uncertain fate of the families in Sheikh Jarrah came after a month of escalating tensions in the city.After Ramadan began in mid-April, clashes erupted nightly between police and Palestinians protesting against security barriers outside Damascus Gate, worsening after a march by ultra-nationalist Jewish extremists angry over assaults by Palestinians on ultra-Orthodox Jews.Meanwhile rare Palestinian elections planned for this month were called off by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who blamed restrictions on Palestinian voting rights in East Jerusalem, in a move which further angered Palestinians. Critics suggested Mr Abbas feared a victory by his party's Islamist challengers Hamas.","postDate":"2021-05-10T12:30:31.000Z","title":"Jerusalem violence: More clashes ahead of nationalist march - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-middle-east-57053074"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/AD7E\/production\/_118441444_colonial-tanks.jpg","author":"By Mary-Ann Russon","description":"The US government issued emergency legislation on Sunday after the largest fuel pipeline in the US was hit by a ransomware cyber-attack.The Colonial Pipeline carries 2.5 million barrels a day - 45% of the East Coast's supply of diesel, petrol and jet fuel.The operator took itself offline on Friday after the cyber-attack and work to restore service is continuing.The US government has relaxed rules on fuel being transported by road.It means drivers in 18 states can work extra or more flexible hours when transporting refined petroleum products.US fuel prices at the pump were largely unaffected on Monday, but there are fears that could change if the shutdown is prolonged.Independent oil market analyst Gaurav Sharma told the BBC a lot of fuel was now stranded at refineries in Texas.\\\"Unless they sort it out by Tuesday, they're in big trouble,\\\" said Mr Sharma. \\\"The first areas to be hit would be Atlanta and Tennessee, then the domino effect goes up to New York.\\\"He said oil futures traders were now \\\"scrambling\\\" to meet demand, at a time when US inventories are declining, and demand - especially for fuel for cars - is on the rise as consumers return to the roads and the economy recovers.The temporary waiver issued by the Department of Transportation enables oil products to be shipped in tankers up to New York, but this would not be anywhere near enough to match the pipeline's capacity, Mr Sharma warned.Sources said the ransomware attack was likely to have been caused by a cyber-criminal gang called DarkSide, who infiltrated Colonial's network and locked the data on some computers and servers, demanding a ransom on Friday.The gang tried to take almost 100 gigabytes of data hostage, threatening to leak it onto the internet, but the FBI and other government agencies worked with private companies to respond. The cloud computing system the hackers used to collect the stolen data was taken offline on Saturday, Reuters reported.Colonial's data did not appear to have been transferred from that system anywhere else, potentially limiting the hackers' leverage to extort or further embarrass the company, the news agency said.On Sunday, Colonial said that although its four main pipelines remain offline, some smaller lines between terminals and delivery points were now operational.\\\"Quickly after learning of the attack, Colonial proactively took certain systems offline to contain the threat. These actions temporarily halted all pipeline operations and affected some of our IT systems, which we are actively in the process of restoring,\\\" the firm said.It added it would bring its full system back online \\\"only when we believe it is safe to do so, and in full compliance with the approval of all federal regulations\\\".Ransomware as a serviceThe incident highlights the risk ransomware can pose to critical national industrial infrastructure, not just businesses.In addition to a notice on their computer screens, victims of a DarkSide attack receive an information pack informing them that their computers and servers are encrypted.The gang lists all the types of data it has stolen, and sends victims the URL of a \\\"personal leak page\\\" where the data is already loaded, waiting to be automatically published, should the company or organisation not pay before the deadline is up.DarkSide also tells victims it will provide proof of the data it has obtained, and is prepared to delete all of it from the victim's network.According to Digital Shadows, a London-based cyber-security firm, DarkSide operates like a business.The gang develops the software used to encrypt and steal data from companies.It then provides ransomware to \\\"affiliates\\\" who pay DarkSide a percentage of their earnings from any successful attacks.When it released new software in March that could encrypt data faster than before, the gang issued a press release and invited journalists to interview it.It even has a website on the dark web where it lists all the companies it has hacked and what was stolen, and an \\\"ethics\\\" page where it says which organisations it will not attack.How did the attack occur?Digital Shadows said the Colonial attack was helped by the coronavirus pandemic, with more engineers remotely accessing control systems for the pipeline from home.James Chappell, co-founder of Digital Shadows, said DarkSide could have bought account login details for remote desktop software such as TeamViewer and Microsoft Remote Desktop.\\\"We're seeing a lot of victims now, this is seriously a big problem,\\\" said Mr Chappell.\\\"The amount of small businesses that are falling victim to this... It's becoming a big problem for the economy globally.\\\"Digital Shadows' research shows the cyber-criminal gang is likely to be based in a Russian-speaking country, as it avoids attacking companies in post-Soviet states including Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.","postDate":"2021-05-10T14:19:22.000Z","title":"US passes emergency waiver over fuel pipeline cyber-attack - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-57050690"},{"thumbnail":"Unknown","author":"Unknown","description":"Lockdowns, social distancing, working from home, furloughs and job losses - the pandemic has put an extra strain on people's lives, relationships and mental wellbeing.According to a study by the Mental Health Foundation published in February, anxiety and worry because of the pandemic actually declined, as people became more hopeful about lockdowns lifting.

The minister in charge of the armed forces, Florence Parly, said they would be punished for defying a law that forbids reservists or serving members of the military from expressing opinions in public on religion and politics.However, far-right leader Marine Le Pen, a candidate in next year's presidential election, spoke out in support of the estimated 1,000 servicemen and women who backed the April letter.The new text was published late on Sunday by Valeurs Actuelles, although the numbers and ranks of its original signatories - said to be active members of the military - remain unclear.The authors of the letter describe themselves as part of a younger generation of soldiers who have served in Afghanistan, Mali and the Central African Republic, or joined domestic anti-terrorism operations.\\\"They gave their skin to destroy the Islamism to which you are giving concessions on our soil,\\\" they wrote.Step into the unknownBecause of their anonymity, it is impossible to gauge how far the writers of this new letter represent the rank-and-file of the armed forces. Online petitions where no-one has to give their name cannot be regarded as firm evidence of anything.Nonetheless, it would come as no surprise if this kind of generalised pessimism about the state of France were indeed the commonplace of barrack-rooms and officers' messes the length and breadth of the country.Most French civilians are also concerned about violence, drugs and Islamism, so for soldiers - by instinct more attached than most to tradition, law-and-order and authority - to share those views is hardly in itself of note.What's contentious is the willingness to go public and blur the lines between the military and the political.

The current Pope is Tawadros II.The Coptic Church separated from other Christian denominations at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, in a dispute over the human and divine nature of Jesus Christ.Coptic Christians are estimated to make up about 10%-15% of Egypt's population of over 100 million.","postDate":"2021-05-10T10:09:24.000Z","title":"Wael al-Saad Tawadros: Coptic monk hanged over bishop's murder in Egypt - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-middle-east-57055411"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/E06B\/production\/_118415475_ligon_ap.jpg","author":"By Swaminathan Natarajan & Lauren Potts","description":"America's \\\"longest juvenile lifer\\\" recently walked out of prison a free man. Joe Ligon spoke to BBC World Service about spending nearly seven decades in jail, why he waited so long for freedom, and how he intends to spend the rest of his days.\\\"I've never been alone, but I am a loner. I prefer to be alone as much as I possibly can. Being in prison, I've been in a single cell all this time, from the time of my arrest all the way up until my release.\\\"That helps people like me, who want to be alone - I was the type of person, once I went in the cell and closed the door, whatever was going on, I didn't see or hear nothing. When we were allowed to have the radio and TV - that was my company.\\\"It's perhaps fair to say that prison life rather suited Joe Ligon, to a degree. It allowed him to keep his head down, his mouth shut and out of trouble - all lessons, he says, he has learned in his 68 years behind bars.And when it came time to retire to his cell at the end of the day, it didn't bother him there was no-one else there. In fact, keeping his own company was something of a considered choice.\\\"I had no friends inside. I had no friends outside. But most people that I associated with\\u2026 I treated them as though they were a friend. And we were cool, we were alright with each other,\\\" he says.\\\"But I didn't use that word friend, I learned that that choice of word means a whole lot to a person like me. And a lot of people say that [if you're a] friend\\u2026 you can be making a big mistake.\\\"Ligon has, by his own admission, always been the solitary sort. Growing up in the country with his maternal grandparents in Birmingham, Alabama, he didn't have many friends and instead remembers fond times with his family, such as the Sundays they spent together watching his other grandfather preach in a local church.He was 13 when he moved from the deep south to Philadelphia to live in a blue-collar neighbourhood with his nurse mum, mechanic dad and younger brother and sister. He struggled in school and could neither read nor write. He didn't play sports and as for friends, they weren't much of a feature.\\\"I didn't do too much hanging out. I was the type of person that had one or two friends, that was it for me - I didn't go for crowds.\\\"When Ligon \\\"got into trouble\\\" on a Friday evening in 1953, he didn't really know the people he was with then either. He had met up with a couple of people he knew casually and as they walked around the neighbourhood, they bumped into some other people who were drinking.\\\"We started asking people for some money so we could get some more wine and one thing led to another...\\\"He trails off. But he admits the night ended in a stabbing spree in which he was involved, violence which left two people dead and six injured.Ligon was the first to be arrested. At the police station, he says he quite truthfully couldn't tell officers who he had been with that night.\\\"Even the two I did know, I didn't know their names, I knew them by their nicknames.\\\"Ligon says he was taken to a police station far from his home in Rodman Street and held for five days, without access to legal help. He says he was angry for a long time that his parents were turned away when they tried to visit.That week, the then 15-year-old was charged with murder - an accusation he has always denied although he has since accepted in an interview with US broadcaster CBS that he stabbed someone who survived and has expressed remorse.\\\"They [the police] started giving us statements to sign, that implicated me in murder. I didn't murder anybody.\\\"Pennsylvania is one of six US states where life imprisonment carries no possibility of a parole. Ligon faced what was called a degree of guilt hearing, where he admitted to the facts of the case, and the judge found him guilty on two counts of first degree murder.The teenager wasn't in court to hear he had been given mandatory life without parole - not unusual given the sentence was a foregone conclusion at the time. But it meant he went to jail without knowing the full terms of his sentence - and it didn't occur to him to ask anyone.\\\"I didn't even know what to ask. I know it's hard to believe but it was the truth,\\\" says Ligon. \\\"I knew I had to do time, but I had no idea I'd be in prison for the rest of my life. I had never even heard the words 'life with parole'.\\\"I'll tell you how messed up I was as a child - I couldn't read or write, couldn't even spell my name. I knew my name was Joe, because that's what I was referred to as far back as I could remember.\\\"Ligon says he entered the prison system confused, rather than scared. The main thing on his mind was being away from his family.As prisoner AE 4126, Ligon seemingly never questioned how much time he had left to serve. He lived in six jails over 68 years, adapting each time to the routine of prison life.\\\"They wake you up at 6 o'clock by the bullhorn, by the voice, 'stand up for count, everybody, it's count time'\\u2026 7 o'clock is meal time, 8 o'clock is work time.\\\"Ligon sometimes worked in the kitchen and laundry room, but was for the most part a cleaner. After a midday meal, he reported back to his duties. A roll call again in the evening and dinner marked the remainder of his day - prison life remaining largely the same while the world outside changed irrevocably over the decades.\\\"I didn't mess with drugs, I didn't drink in jail, I did none of that crazy stuff that causes people to get killed, I didn't try to escape, I didn't give nobody a hard time,\\\" he recalls.\\\"I stayed as humble as I possibly could - what prison has taught me along with many other things is mind your business, always try to do what's right, stay away from trouble when it's humanly possible to do.\\\"Some 53 years into his sentence, Ligon was told a lawyer wanted to see him.Buoyed by the US Supreme Court's ruling in 2005 that juveniles couldn't be executed, Bradley S Bridge had started looking into what he believed would be the next big legal issue to come out of it - juveniles who had been given life without parole.At the time, Pennsylvania had 525 prisoners in such circumstances which was the highest in the US, according to Bridge. Philadelphia had 325 - and Ligon was its longest serving. The assistant defender arranged to meet him.\\\"He was not really aware of his sentence,\\\" says Bridge, from the Defender Association of Philadelphia. \\\"He knew nothing about it until I met with him. It's kind of interesting he had never given up hope - he was completely optimistic, from the very beginning, always expected that something would be done.\\\"For Ligon, the meeting was eye-opening. When Bridge showed him a copy of the appeal challenging the legal status of his sentence, it was the first time Ligon learned the terms of his incarceration.\\\"I realised that I was being mistreated from the time of my arrest. And I was taught and I learned that it was unconstitutional to be sentenced [as a juvenile] without the possibility of parole.\\\"In 2016, the US Supreme Court ruled all juvenile lifers had to be resentenced. The following year, Ligon was resentenced to 35 years, meaning he could apply for parole due to time served. Bridge urged him to but was met with flat refusal. Ligon felt his sentence had always been unconstitutional, so why should he accept parole, which would mean his liberty was monitored.Bridge therefore had to challenge the 2017 judgement and eventually took the case to federal court, where in November 2020, the judge ruled in his favour. When Bridge went to Montgomery County to pick Ligon up on 11 February, he found the former inmate remarkably calm.\\\"I would have expected a stronger 'oh my god' reaction. But he didn't have that. No drama, nothing.\\\"Ligon was perhaps simply doing what he had done for decades: keeping his thoughts to himself.A month since his release, he reflects on the day he left State Correctional Institution Phoenix with a degree of wonder.\\\"It was like being born all over again. Because everything was new to me - just about everything [changed].\\\" Cars and tall buildings especially, he notes.The last 68 years have come at a cost to Ligon. He knows he has lost further time by waiting for release without parole - time he could have spent with his family, many of whom have since died.And yet, as this 83-year-old adjusts to what he has waited so long for, he has few plans. Rather, he's going to stick to what he knows best.\\\"I'm gonna do the same thing I've been doing my whole life. Give me a job of cleaning, as a janitor.\\\"","postDate":"2021-05-09T00:55:47.000Z","title":"Joe Ligon: America's 'longest juvenile lifer' on 68 years in prison - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-57022924"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/16F7E\/production\/_118387049_hi066759958.jpg","author":"By Geeta Pandey","description":"When millions of devout Hindus gathered last month in the Himalayan town of Haridwar to participate in the Kumbh Mela festival even as India battled a devastating second wave of coronavirus, many feared that it would turn out to be a \\\"super-spreader event\\\".Those fears, it now seems, are coming true, with reports of Kumbh returnees testing positive - and possibly spreading the infection - coming from many parts of the country.When Mahant Shankar Das arrived in Haridwar on 15 March to participate in the festival, cases of Covid-19 were already rising in many parts of India.On 4 April, just four days after the festival officially began, the 80-year-old Hindu priest tested positive for Covid-19 and was advised to quarantine in a tent.But instead of isolating, he packed his bags, boarded a train and travelled 1,000km (621 miles) to the city of Varanasi.There, his son Nagendra Pathak met him at the railway station and they rode a shared taxi to their village 20km (12 miles) away in the adjoining district of Mirzapur.Speaking to me on the phone from his home recently, Mahant Das said he was \\\"now hale and hearty\\\" and that after his return, he had remained at home in quarantine.He insisted that he did not pass on the virus to anyone else, but within days, his son and a few other villagers also developed Covid symptoms.Mr Pathak, who's also made a full recovery, says their village has seen \\\"13 deaths in the past fortnight from fever and cough\\\".The infections in the villagers may - or may not - be linked to Mahant Das, but health experts say his behaviour was irresponsible and that by travelling in a crowded train and sharing a taxi, he may have spread the virus to many along the way.Epidemiologist Dr Lalit Kant says \\\"huge groups of mask-less pilgrims sitting on the river bank singing the glories of the Ganges\\\" created an ideal environment for the virus to spread rapidly. \\\"We already know that chorus singing in churches and temples are known to be super-spreader events.\\\"In Haridwar, officials said 2,642 devotees had tested positive, including dozens of top religious leaders.Akhilesh Yadav, former chief minister of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state, and Nepal's former King Gyanendra Shah and former Queen Komal Shah, were among those who tested positive after returning home. Bollywood composer Shravan Rathod died in a Mumbai hospital soon after his return from Kumbh. Nine Hindu seers from one group also perished.With growing fears that the Kumbh returnees could start to infect others, several worried state governments ordered a 14-day mandatory quarantine and warned of strict action against those who withheld information about their travels.Some made the RT-PCR test mandatory for them, but few states have a database of travellers and no state has a foolproof system of testing and tracing those entering its borders.In the past fortnight, reports of Kumbh returnees testing positive have come from all over India:\\\"It's disastrous,\\\" says Dr Kant. \\\"And these numbers are only the tip of the iceberg. The groups of pilgrims travelling in crowded trains and buses would have the multiplier effect on the number of infections. I can say without hesitation that the Kumbh Mela is one of the main reasons behind the rise in cases in India.\\\"Mahant Das is combative when I ask him if it would have been better to cancel the Kumbh at a time India was recording huge surges in daily cases and hospitals were turning away patients due to a shortage of beds, medical oxygen and life-saving drugs.\\\"How is it right for the government to hold election rallies and elections in West Bengal then? Why is it that only we, the devout, are being told that it was wrong to gather?\\\" he asks.Critics say Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reluctance to cancel the gathering was because of possible backlash from Hindu religious leaders like Mahant Das. The priests, the seers and the ascetics are among the party's biggest supporters and play an important role in mobilising Hindu votes during elections.On 12 April, the first big day of the festival - when more than three million devotees took a dip in the river Ganges in the belief that bathing there would help them attain salvation - India logged more than 168,000 new cases, overtaking Brazil to become the country with the second-highest number of cases globally.The festival was scaled down only a week later after the lead monk of one of the participating groups died. Mr Modi requested the seers to turn the festival from then on into a symbolic event.But the damage had already been done.Last week, the event organisers said 9.1 million pilgrims visited Haridwar even as the Uttarakhand high court said the state had become a \\\"laughing stock by allowing the Kumbh Mela in the midst of a raging pandemic\\\".There had been concerns from the start that holding the Kumbh was fraught with risks.Health experts had warned the government in early March that \\\"a new and more contagious variant of the coronavirus was taking hold in the country\\\" and letting millions of largely unmasked people gather for a festival was not prudent.Uttarakhand's former chief minister, Trivendra Singh Rawat, told me that he had planned the Kumbh to be a \\\"limited, symbolic event\\\" from the start because experts were \\\"telling me that the pandemic is not going to end soon\\\".\\\"The festival attracts people from not just India, but other countries too. I was worried that healthy people would visit Haridwar and take the infection back with them everywhere. \\\"But just days before the festival, he was replaced by Tirath Singh Rawat, who famously remarked that with \\\"the blessings of Ma Ganga [Ganges, the river goddess] in the flow, there would be no corona\\\".The new chief minister said \\\"nobody will be stopped\\\", a negative Covid report was not necessary to attend, and that it would be enough to follow safety rules. But as millions descended on the town, officials struggled to impose safety norms.Haridwar's chief medical officer, Dr Shambhu Kumar Jha, told me that crowd management became \\\"very difficult\\\" because people didn't come with negative reports and that they \\\"couldn't turn back the devout who had come all the way driven by faith\\\".\\\"You can't hang people for wanting to attend a religious festival, can you?\\\" he asked.\\\"There were standard operating procedures (SOPs) by the federal government and the high court and we tried our best to implement them,\\\" he added.\\\"With crowds of that size, SOPs became almost impossible to follow. They look very good on paper, but it's impossible to implement them,\\\" Anoop Nautiyal, founder of an Uttarakhand-based think tank, told the BBC.Mr Nautiyal, who has been collating the health ministry data since the state recorded its first case on 15 March 2020, says Uttarakhand had recorded 557 cases in the week from 14 to 20 March, just as pilgrims had begun arriving. The cases rose rapidly after that, with 38,581 cases recorded between 25 April and 1 May - the last week of the festival.\\\"It will be wrong to say all the cases were because of the festival, but the surge has coincided with the festival,\\\" he said.I asked Dr Kant if there's anything India could do now to contain the damage done by allowing the gathering.\\\"Someone said that the devotees will take the coronavirus as prasad [god's blessing] and spread it. It's tragic that the pilgrims have carried the infection everywhere,\\\" he said.\\\"I can't think of anything that can be done now to rectify the situation. Our ship has gone too far out into the sea. We can't even return to the safety of the harbour. It's very, very tragic. I just pray that the infections were mild and people can get over them.\\\"","postDate":"2021-05-09T23:02:03.000Z","title":"India Covid: Kumbh Mela pilgrims turn into super-spreaders - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-india-57005563"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/1419A\/production\/_118303328_carbyne-connecticut-still-image-01.png","author":"By Mary-Ann Russon","description":"Mary-Kate Smith was out kayaking off the coast of Connecticut last August when she overturned.\\\"I was very scared, didn't know what to do, or where to go,\\\" she says.Only four months earlier another kayaker had drowned in the same area. That incident had alarmed the mayor of coastal city Stamford, who asked the local emergency services to look at new safety technologies.Carbyne, a cloud-based emergency communication platform, was installed in August. It enables a 911 dispatcher to send a text message to the caller. This includes a link, which once opened starts a video chat.Just a few hours after it went live Ms Smith had her accident in Long Island Sound, and the system was put to the test for the first time.\\\"There weren't any boats going by [but] I was able to show with my phone where I was,\\\" she says.From the video call, 911 dispatcher AJ Minichino saw that Ms Smith had badly injured her leg. Her kayak was sinking, but she had been able to free herself and make it to a nearby rock and use her mobile.The Carbyne system also provided Ms Smith's exact GPS co-ordinates, so Mr Minichino was able to get a rescue boat out to her \\\"in a matter of seconds\\\".\\\"I feel like if we didn't know where she was, we would have been searching around for a while,\\\" says Mr Minichino.Carbyne is an Israeli company, and one of many technology firms around the world that have helped emergency services and health authorities during the pandemic.Founded in 2016 by Amir Elichai, he came up with the idea after he was robbed on a beach.\\\"I tried to call the police, and the reaction was horrible,\\\" he says. \\\"I gave them my name, my location, but it was hard to know [exactly] where I was on the beach.\\\"When you call an Uber, Uber knows exactly where you are, but if you call the emergency services, they're blind.\\\"Today, the platform handles one million calls a day, in more than 70 countries.There has been a jump in usage due to the pandemic. In Ohio, a woman kidnapped by her husband and held at gunpoint was able to click on a link sent via text message, and silently communicate with emergency services, enabling police to rescue her.And in Maharashtra, India, a woman showing coronavirus symptoms gave birth remotely, with doctors coaching her husband over video on how to deliver the baby.\\\"On average, after governments started using Carbyne, they have seen a 25% reduction in the time to dispatch emergency responders, a 15% reduction in the total responders dispatched, and a 50% reduction in prank or mistaken calls,\\\" says Mr Elichai.In the UK, half of the country's police forces are now using software provided by US-Israeli firm Nice to cut down on the time taken to collect video evidence, and then store it securely in the cloud.\\\"Video is prolific in the UK, but one of the problems today is that the investigator has to go and find all the people who have CCTV cameras around the incident, knock on their doors asking for their footage, and talk to citizens taking video on their phones,\\\" says Nice's executive vice president Christopher Wooten.Its software works by sending witnesses a link via text message, taking them to a website where they can immediately upload pictures or video, while standing at the scene of an incident.Cleveland Police in north-east England says the software has eliminated 4,500 trips per week made by officers to collect evidence.French firm Teleperformance is a leading global provider of call centres for companies and health providers.It has an artificial intelligence-based platform that detects distress signals in customer calls. The system alerts the operator that they need to be extra empathetic when dealing with people worried about access to food, emergency loans or needing healthcare. It also reroutes calls to operators trained to deal with crisis calls.At the start of the pandemic, Teleperformance, which has a global workforce of 383,000, had to work out a way to enable its staff to work from home. And then a European government asked for its help with track and trace monitoring.The firm set up a new virtual call centre platform in less than two weeks. Regarding the request from that particular country, it enabled 6,000 of its home-working employees to provide citizens with information on local testing centres.\\\"I think we even surprised ourselves,\\\" says Teleperformance's founder and chief executive Daniel Julien. \\\"We had to build a totally new virtual company.\\\"He says it has been an ongoing challenge requiring a huge amount of troubleshooting and the invention of new software to help manage the crisis, plus the hiring of thousands of new staff to support call centres globally.There are now 12 countries using Teleperformance to provide coronavirus track and trace services.New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.During the first lockdown, the UK's Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) realised it didn't have enough volunteers to staff its 238 lifeboat stations, as 250 crew members were in self-isolation and 15 crew members had Covid symptoms.The service turned to US firm Esri, which specialises in geographic information systems - a mapping technology that combines different types of data with cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide useful insights.Esri offered its technology for free last year to any organisation trying to solve a pandemic challenge, donating £8m worth of software to emergency responders, universities, charities, local government and even utility companies.The RNLI used Esri's software to alert it to gaps in crew rotas and geographic areas that would be impacted by the shortage.From 23 March to 4 May 2020, the RNLI launched its lifeboats 314 times and aided 236 people. It believes that at least seven people alive today would have died at sea, without the software.\\\"This was an innovative use of our platform that we'd not foreseen,\\\" says Miles Gabriel, the Covid-19 disaster response programme lead at Esri UK.There are many other examples of how Esri has been used, but the most famous is Johns Hopkins University's live coronavirus tracking map, which was voted one of 2020's best innovations by Time Magazine.Another technology firm that has assisted health authorities during the pandemic is US giant Cisco. When the UK government built the temporary Nightingale Hospital at the ExCeL London conference and exhibition centre in April 2020, Cisco helped build a \\\"medical grade\\\" infrastructure system for the facility in just seven days.This included each of the 4,000 intensive care unit beds having a stable 1GB wi-fi connection, so that the data from up to 20 internet-connected medical devices would be instantly sent to the cloud and reviewed by medical staff.\\\"We have the resources and technology, and culturally we believe we have a moral obligation to help where we can,\\\" says Cisco UK and Ireland's chief executive David Meads.Back in Connecticut, AJ Minichino is thrilled at how technological advances are helping the emergency services. \\\"Once I saw the rescue boat come on the video [from Ms Smith], I had this feeling of, 'Wow it actually worked, and in record time.'\\\"","postDate":"2021-05-10T00:49:43.000Z","title":"'I was injured but the rescue boat found me in seconds' - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56741003"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/171E3\/production\/_118419649_hvaldimir1.jpg","author":"By Joshua Nevett","description":"A mysterious beluga whale was dubbed a spy when he appeared off Norway's coast wearing a Russian harness. Two years on, little more is known of the animal's past, but now activists are concerned for his future welfare.One campaign group led by an American filmmaker wants to create a sanctuary and is urging Norway to support it.The whale's first known sighting in Norway came at the end of April 2019, when a blob of white flashed past fishermen near the islands of Ingoya and Rolvsoya.This was strange because belugas are rarely seen this far south of the high Arctic. Stranger still was the harness wrapped tightly around the whale's body.The whale seemed to be seeking help. A concerned fisherman, Joar Hesten, sent images to marine biologist Audun Rikardsen, who contacted the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries for assistance. Seafaring inspector Jorgen Ree Wiig was dispatched to investigate.\\\"I saw the whale, thinking this is really something,\\\" Mr Ree Wiig told the BBC. \\\"I knew this situation was quite unique.\\\"The fisherman put on a survival suit and jumped into the icy water, freed the whale and retrieved the harness. To his surprise it had a camera mount and clips bearing the inscription \\\"Equipment St. Petersburg\\\".An investigation was launched by Norway's domestic intelligence agency, which has since told the BBC \\\"the whale is likely to have been part of a Russian research programme\\\".Russia has a history of training marine mammals such as dolphins for military purposes and the Barents Observer website has identified whale pens at three different locations near naval bases in the north-west area of Murmansk.The purpose of the pens and the origin of the whale have never been officially addressed by the Russian military.A retired Russian colonel, Viktor Baranets, told Reuters news agency he had been informed that the scientists in Russia's north were \\\"using beluga whales for tasks of civil information gathering, rather than military tasks\\\".Norwegians were captivated by the whale's dramatic rescue. Because of the whale's apparent spy status, he was given a tongue-in-cheek name. In a nod to hval, Norwegian for whale, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the beluga was christened Hvaldimir.Within days of his rescue, he had taken up residence in the harbour at Hammerfest, a coastal town of about 11,000 people. The first few weeks there were rough for Hvaldimir, who was struggling to feed himself.To save his life, Norway's fisheries directorate approved a programme to monitor and feed Hvaldimir.The beluga recovered, left Hammerfest harbour and started feeding independently. Since 19 July, 2019, he has been a \\\"free-swimming\\\" whale, according to the Norwegian Orca Survey, which ran the feeding programme.American film-maker Regina Crosby, a part-time resident in Norway, saw cinematic potential. She set out to make a short film, but is still awaiting a happy ending.\\\"Nothing was what I thought it was,\\\" she told the BBC.\\\"I thought it was going to be a happy story about a whale escaping from the Russian military. I thought it was going to be done in a week. But as time went on, no-one was doing anything for this whale.\\\"That was when her campaign began.For a sociable animal that seeks out human interaction, dangers abound, and Ms Crosby felt Hvaldimir needed protection.Boat propellers, fishing nets and tourists are among the most severe threats. By the end of 2019 her campaign had begun and when others joined her cause activist group OneWhale was formed.Against keeping the whale in captivity, they decided to keep Hvaldimir safe and, if possible, return him to the wild. Ms Crosby sought expert advice from American activist Ric O'Barry.A former dolphin trainer, he has since spent decades campaigning against captivity and featured in The Cove, an Oscar-winning documentary about the slaughter of dolphins in Taiji, Japan.\\\"Whenever a dolphin or a whale is in trouble, my phone will ring,\\\" Mr O'Barry told the BBC.One call from Regina Crosby and he was on a plane to Norway in July 2020. When he arrived Hvaldimir had suffered a nasty gash across his body, apparently inflicted by a boat.Urgent action was needed, Mr O'Barry believed. \\\"My thought was to swim him into a fjord.\\\"Fjords are abundant along Norway's coastlines. The long, narrow waterways stretch far inland from the sea. Perhaps one could be sealed off and turned into a secure sanctuary, he thought.All Ms Crosby had to do was convince Norway's government - a country with a history of whale hunting.For months, OneWhale has been in talks with government agencies about creating a sanctuary for Hvaldimir and other stricken marine wildlife in a disused fjord.The group's idea is for \\\"an enormous, open-water marine wildlife reserve\\\" in a fjord at least two kilometres long (1.2 miles) and one kilometre wide. The mouth of the fjord would be closed off by a sub-sea net and there would be a cabin with facilities for staff.OneWhale says two communities in northern Norway have expressed serious interest and funds have been approved for studying the sanctuary's impact. \\\"Right now it's very much a green light,\\\" said Ms Crosby.Not everyone agrees with the idea. Mr Rikardsen, the marine biologist, said the whale seemed to be in good health, feeding at different fish farms.\\\"As far as Norway is concerned, he's a free-living whale,\\\" said Mr Ree Wiig, an observer for the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission. \\\"I think the situation now is the best one.\\\"For him keeping an animal in a closed-off fjord is \\\"not a Norwegian thing to do\\\". \\\"But if someone can convince me otherwise, I'm open-minded. If there's a good plan, I think the government would consider it.\\\"Various government agencies need to give their approval and Norway's fisheries directorate told the BBC it had discussed the idea with OneWhale and believed Hvaldimir should be \\\"left alone and given the opportunity to live as a free animal\\\" if he was not at great risk.Mr O'Barry fears such freedom could mean a life of solitude for the whale and argues that sanctuary care \\\"may be the best we can do\\\".He points to a dolphin sanctuary he founded in West Bali, Indonesia, where former captive animals are assessed for their fitness for life in the wild. If not, they remain in the sanctuary for the rest of their lives.For now, Hvaldimir eats and sleeps at a fish farm, where a hungry whale is not particularly welcome.He is free to roam, occasionally seeking humans to fulfil his social needs. He seems to share an affinity with humans that's as dangerous as it is endearing, because of the apparent captivity he endured.Videos of him playing with tourists appear on social media from time to time, heightening concern for his welfare.His self-appointed guardians visit whenever they can. Ms Crosby described how the whale recently chased her boat when it started to leave. Hvaldimir slowly faded from view, a blur of white below the setting sun.","postDate":"2021-05-09T23:04:27.000Z","title":"Hvaldimir: Seeking sanctuary for whale dubbed a Russian spy - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-56956365"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/7E16\/production\/_118387223_orie.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"Nigeria's Igbo community have a reputation for being highly successful businessmen - partly thanks to a community-run apprentice scheme that emerged from the ruins of war, writes the BBC's Chiagozie Nwonwu in Lagos.A smiling Onyeka Orie, 28, looks the picture of happiness in his mobile phone accessories shop at the sprawling Computer Village in Nigeria's main city, Lagos.The shop and everything in it had been given to him by his former boss after Mr Orie worked for him without payment for several years, learning the trade.\\\"I served my oga [boss] for eight years. My oga gave me this shop. I had been managing the shop for four years before he gave it to me.

In exchange, the boys pick up life skills and are taught how to run a business. They are also given food and somewhere to live.At the end of an agreed period, their boss gives them capital to set up their own business.The Igbo apprenticeship system has roots in Nigeria's post-civil-war years, says Ndubuisi Ekekwe, a Nigerian professor whose article on the apprentice scheme is set to appear in the Harvard Business Review later this month.The Igbos, emerging from defeat following the 1967-70 civil war, managed to recover a significant portion of their pre-war economic status within just two years.This was despite the Nigerian government confiscating bank accounts belonging to many Igbos. It then gave them just £20 ($28) to start anew, while others saw their property seized by neighbours in some parts of the country.The Peoples Club, a popular social club formed in the town of Aba in 1971, is also credited for kick-starting the Igbo apprenticeship scheme.The ethos of the club, the Igbo philosophy of \\\"onye a hana nwanne ya\\\" (don't leave your brother behind) is seen as a guiding principle of the scheme.\\\"The Peoples Club was a social-cum-economic movement\\u2026[that] designed an economic template of how the Igbo could move out of the ruins of the war and began a new movement of survival,\\\" says Benedict Okoro, founder of the Odinala Cultural Heritage Foundation. \\\"That is the genesis of the Igba Boi in Igbo cosmology.\\\"The apprentice system is mostly aimed at boys and young men as families are generally unwilling to let their daughters live with a businessman for the five years or so it takes to learn a trade.Women instead usually learn at established businesses where they pay to be taught for six months to one year, while still living at home.'I got nothing after seven years'Prominent Nigerian businessmen such as auto tycoons Innocent Chukwuma of Innoson Motors and Cosmas Maduka of Coscharis Group are among the products of the scheme.In a 2019 interview with BBC Igbo, Mr Maduka said that the 200 naira ($0.70; £0.50) given to him by his boss at the end of his apprenticeship in 1976 had laid the foundation for his multimillion-naira business empire.The success of the scheme is also visible in eastern cities such as Onitsha, Aba and Nnewi where sprawling markets attract traders from across West Africa.But the system is not without its critics, as it relies on the goodwill of the employer to look after the apprentice at the end of their service.Ndubuisi Ilo, who now runs a successful auto parts shop in Ladipo, Lagos, says he was given nothing after serving his boss for seven years.\\\"My boss called me one day and told me that he can't afford to settle [pay] me. He prayed for me and asked me to start hustling for myself. It was very difficult at first and I even had to sleep in cars, but now I look back and smile,\\\" he says.Nevertheless, he does not consider his apprenticeship a waste of time, as he used the knowledge he gained to start trading.\\\"Some businessmen don't want to keep to the agreement because of the amount of money involved in setting up a business for an apprentice that has completed his time.\\\"Some of them accuse the apprentices of theft or something else and terminate the agreement,\\\" Mr Ilo says.Igba Boi agreements are usually verbal and when a businessman reneges on them, apprentices have few options for redress.Since many of the businessmen are relatives, the extended family usually tries to mediate in any disputes and when they fail, the ancestral village of one or both parties steps in and try to resolve the matter.Sometimes issues are amicably resolved, at other times they are not, leaving the apprentice to fend for himself after years of free labour.'An example for Africa'Mr Okoro's foundation is looking to institutionalise the Igba Boi scheme to minimise the risk of people defaulting on agreements.\\\"An institutionalised system would have backing of the law and won't just be something between the traders and the apprentice and his family,\\\" he says. \\\"The apprentice will even get a certificate after his apprenticeship.\\\"You may also be interested in:Mr Ekekwe notes that helping potential business rivals goes against traditional capitalist thinking but it goes to the heart of this system, which generally seems to work well for all concerned.\\\"[Economist] Adam Smith believes that success in business entails ensuring driving out your competitors, but this system is hinged on bringing more people into the business,\\\" he says.In the forthcoming issue of the Harvard Business Review he says he wants \\\"to present the Igbo Apprenticeship System [IAS] as a thesis for the world as the conversation continues on stakeholder capitalism, not just shareholder capitalism\\\".On his website, he suggests that it should be used across Africa. \\\"Put the IAS in Economics textbook in Nigeria!\\\"'Better than a university degree'Current unemployment data in Nigeria paints a dire picture - 33% of those looking for work cannot find any. Many of them are university graduates.Mr Orie says his financial situation is better than many of his peers who went on to acquire a university education.He has also started thinking of getting a young man from the village to learn the trade under him, an act that is at the heart of the system.Many of his peers are now hiring sales assistants to run their shops, rather than using the Igba Boi system.However Mr Ilo says the future of the system that produced him and millions of other businessmen is safe.\\\"As long as there are markets and Igbo traders, there will be apprentices,\\\" he says.","postDate":"2021-05-10T00:39:41.000Z","title":"How a Nigerian scheme forged in war creates billionaires - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-africa-56985304"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/DC54\/production\/_118440465_gettyimages-1232742268.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"Scotland's first minister has told Prime Minister Boris Johnson that a second independence referendum is \\\"a matter of when - not if\\\".Nicola Sturgeon spoke directly with Mr Johnson for the first time since the SNP won an emphatic victory in Thursday's Holyrood election.Earlier, Ms Sturgeon said she did not expect the debate to end up in court.A senior UK government minister appeared to suggest it would not mount a legal challenge to her plans.During a phone call with Mr Johnson on Sunday afternoon, the first minister pledged to work with the UK government on steering the country through the Covid pandemic towards recovery.The SNP said the leaders also agreed the importance of both governments working together \\\"closely and constructively\\\" to make the forthcoming UN climate conference in Glasgow a success.But a party spokeswoman added: \\\"The FM also re-iterated her intention to ensure that the people of Scotland can choose our own future when the crisis is over, and made clear that the question of a referendum is now a matter of when - not if.\\\"The UK Government said Mr Johnson spoke to the first minister to \\\"congratulate her on her party's success\\\" in the Scottish Parliament election.A spokesman said the prime minister emphasised \\\"the importance of focusing on Covid recovery at this time\\\".He added: \\\"They both agreed that their immediate focus should be on working together to build back from the pandemic.\\\"The Prime Minister reiterated his invitation for the first minister to join a summit meeting to discuss our shared challenges on Covid recovery and how we can overcome them.\\\"'Significant challenges'Meanwhile, appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Nicola Sturgeon was questioned whether she would introduce a referendum bill as early as next spring based on predictions that the UK will have recovered in terms of coronavirus circulation and GDP.She said: \\\"That would certainly work for that timescale of within the first half of the parliamentary term.\\\"I desperately hope those predictions are correct but we have to judge that as we go through this year. We've still got significant challenges ahead. I wouldn't rule that out but I'm not sitting here saying that is the timescale.\\\"Mr Johnson earlier invited Ms Sturgeon and her Welsh counterpart Mark Drakeford to a summit to discuss a UK-wide approach to recovery from the pandemic.He has said it would be \\\"reckless and irresponsible\\\" to have a referendum right now, and the UK government is not currently expected to grant formal consent for a vote to be held - as it did ahead of the 2014 referendum.There has been speculation that the row could end up with the courts being asked to rule on whether the Scottish government has the power to hold a referendum without the UK government's agreement.But Ms Sturgeon said she did not believe either side wanted a legal battle over the issue.She said: \\\"The UK government knows that if we ever get into a situation where this is being determined in the courts then actually what the UK government is arguing is that there is no democratic route for Scotland to have independence.\\\"The implications of that would be very grave indeed. If the argument of the unionist side is that Scotland is trapped it strikes me that that is one of the strongest arguments for independence.\\\"Ms Sturgeon also said it would be \\\"absurd and completely outrageous\\\" if the UK government went to court over the issue and that it was \\\"up to the Scottish people\\\" to decide the country's future.Her party stood on a manifesto to steer the country out of the pandemic, and to then hold a referendum, which she said people had \\\"voted overwhelmingly for\\\".She added: \\\"The fact that we are sitting here having a debate about whether or not that outcome is going to be respected says a lot about the lack of respect for Scottish democracy that this UK government has demonstrated for quite some time now.\\\"No green lightAlso appearing on the programme, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said he would \\\"not go near\\\" the issue of the UK government potentially challenging a referendum bill in court.He said: \\\"Whatever parties we come from, the priority at the moment is not court cases, it's not independence legislation - it is recovery from the pandemic.\\\"When asked if Scotland was allowed to leave the UK, he said: \\\"Of course it is, through a legal referendum which would allow people to make that choice.\\\"But he also insisted that the SNP's failure to win an overall majority showed that the people of Scotland were not \\\"agitating\\\" for a referendum.The SNP finished on 64 seats in Thursday's Scottish election - one short of a majority but one more than it won in 2016 - while the Conservatives won 31, Labour 22, the pro-independence Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four.But Mr Gove said a majority of voters - 51% - had backed parties that were opposed to independence in the constituency ballot - although the same percentage voted for pro-independence parties in the regional list ballot.BBC Scotland's Sunday Show later asked Mr Gove to clarify the indication he gave to Marr that the UK government would not mount a legal challenge to a Scottish independence referendum bill.Mr Gove said: \\\"We are not going to go down the route of talking about independence or legal challenges or anything like that now when our principle focus and exclusive attention is going on pandemic recovery.\\\"At the moment all we want to do is work with the first minister to concentrate on dealing with the consequences of the pandemic and the need to recover and build back better.\\\"Mr Gove denied he was giving the Scottish government a green light to pass a referendum bill, saying \\\"we are concentrating on recovery at the moment\\\".'Difficult journey'In her victory speech, Ms Sturgeon said her priority was leading the country through the pandemic - but said she still intended to hold an independence referendum once the crisis has passed.In a letter to Ms Sturgeon published on Saturday night, the prime minister invited Ms Sturgeon to \\\"discuss our shared challenges\\\", adding \\\"we will not always agree - but I am confident... we will be able to build back better, in the interests of the people we serve.\\\"Mr Johnson said the country needed to \\\"show the same spirit of unity and co-operation that marked our fight against the pandemic\\\" in engineering a Covid-19 recovery.But he warned it would be a \\\"difficult journey\\\", adding: \\\"The broad shoulders of the UK have supported jobs and businesses the length and breadth of the country, but we know that economic recovery will be a serious shared responsibility.\\\"","postDate":"2021-05-09T18:18:00.000Z","title":"Nicola Sturgeon tells PM referendum is case of 'when -

It has since transpired that the letter was intercepted by MI5.By April 1941, Hess was desperate. He had been practising with his aircraft, waiting for Hamilton to indicate he was ready to talk.He went back to Haushofer who told him there were still people who wanted peace.Dr Crossland says Hess interpreted this as the go-ahead and made the fateful decision to fly to Britain.\\\"From Hess's point of view, the alleged existence of people who are dissenting towards Churchill's stance was enough to assume that these people were ready to overthrow Churchill and make a peace with Hitler,\\\" he says.Dr Crossland says: \\\"Hess was a very desperate man, he quite naïve, he was delusional and so for him this made all the sense in the world.\\\"Why was Hess so desperate?Dr Crossland says Hess was one of Hitler's earliest adherents. He served time with him in Landsberg Prison, following the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923.\\\"At one time he was possibly the closest thing Hitler had to a real friend,\\\" Dr Crossland says.But by WW2 his star was waning within the inner circle of the Third Reich and he was often derided and made fun of by other leading figures.\\\"He did have a certain amount of desperation to reclaim the favour of Hitler,\\\" Dr Crossland says.Dr Crossland says the official story is that this was a flight undertaken by a deluded man who got bad information and believed something that was not real.He says conspiracy theories were borne of a period where there were gaps in the historical record but many of these have been filled by the declassification of papers which have pushed the burden of evidence towards the conventional reading of events.After his arrest Hess was examined by Dr Henry Dicks whose first impression was of a \\\"schizoid psychopath\\\".As their talks progressed, Dr Dicks was struck by Hess and Hitler's admiration of the British, despite Germany having the upper hand in the war at that time.Dr Dicks thought an affection for the British may have been why Hess chose to make his solo flight to Scotland.Hitler said he had no knowledge of what Hess was trying to do and the Nazi Party soon declared him insane.In 1946, Hess was sentenced at the Nuremberg trials to life imprisonment. He died at Spandau prison in 1987, at the age of 93.The fact that Hess was kept in the prison alone after other Nazi figures were released in 1966 led to assumptions that he was being held because they did not want his true story to ever get out.However, files released in 2017 show the British government petitioned the Soviets on multiple occasions to release Hess.\\\"If there was something to hide about Hess's knowledge it does seem peculiar that the British government would want him released to tell his side of the story,\\\" Dr Crossland says.He said that for scholars of WW2 the Hess story was \\\"curiosity\\\" but it merited no more than a couple of paragraphs in most historians' account of the war.\\\"It is enduringly bizarre and I engage with it on that level,\\\" Dr Crossland says.","postDate":"2021-05-10T01:23:46.000Z","title":"Why did a Nazi leader crash-land in Scotland? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-scotland-56908183"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/2D3E\/production\/_118428511_gettyimages-1215124320-170667a.jpg","author":"Soutik Biswas","description":"On Saturday morning, Dr Akshay Nair, a Mumbai-based eye surgeon, was waiting to operate on a 25-year-old woman who had recovered from a bout of Covid-19 three weeks ago.Inside the surgery, an ear, nose and throat specialist was already at work on the patient, a diabetic.He had inserted a tube in her nose and was removing tissues infected with mucormycosis, a rare but dangerous fungal infection. This aggressive infection affects the nose, eye and sometimes the brain.After his colleague finished, Dr Nair would carry out a three hour procedure to remove the patient's eye.\\\"I will be removing her eye to save her life. That's how this disease works,\\\" Dr Nair told me.Even as a deadly second wave of Covid-19 ravages India, doctors are now reporting a rash of cases involving a rare infection - also called the \\\"black fungus\\\" - among recovering and recovered Covid-19 patients.What is mucormycosis?Mucormycosis is a very rare infection. It is caused by exposure to mucor mould which is commonly found in soil, plants, manure, and decaying fruits and vegetables. \\\"It is ubiquitous and found in soil and air and even in the nose and mucus of healthy people,\\\" says Dr Nair.It affects the sinuses, the brain and the lungs and can be life-threatening in diabetic or severely immunocompromised individuals, such as cancer patients or people with HIV\\\/AIDS.Doctors believe mucormycosis, which has an overall mortality rate of 50%, may be being triggered by the use of steroids, a life-saving treatment for severe and critically ill Covid-19 patients.Steroids reduce inflammation in the lungs for Covid-19 and appear to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body's immune system goes into overdrive to fight off coronavirus. But they also reduce immunity and push up blood sugar levels in both diabetics and non-diabetic Covid-19 patients.It's thought that this drop in immunity could be triggering these cases of mucormycosis.\\\"Diabetes lowers the body's immune defences, coronavirus exacerbates it, and then steroids which help fight Covid-19 act like fuel to the fire,\\\" says Dr Nair.Dr Nair - who works in three hospitals in Mumbai, one of the worst-hit cities in the second wave - says he has already seen some 40 patients suffering from the fungal infection in April. Many of them were diabetics who had recovered from Covid-19 at home. Eleven of them had to have an eye surgically removed.Between December and February, just six of his colleagues in five cities - Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi and Pune - reported 58 cases of the infection. Most of the patients contracted it between 12 to 15 days after recovery from Covid-19.Mumbai's busy Sion Hospital has reported 24 cases of the fungal infection in the past two months, up from six cases a year, according to Dr Renuka Bradoo, head of the hospital's ear, nose and throat wing.Eleven of them had to lose an eye, and six of them died. Most of her patients are middle-aged diabetics who were struck down by the fungus two weeks after recovering from Covid-19. \\\"We are already seeing two to three cases a week here. It's a nightmare inside a pandemic,\\\" she told me.In the southern city of Bengaluru, Dr Raghuraj Hegde, an eye surgeon, tells a similar story. He has seen 19 cases of mucormycosis in the past two weeks, most of them young patients. \\\"Some were so sick that we couldn't even operate on them.\\\"Doctors say they are surprised by the severity and the frequency of this fungal infection during the second wave, compared to some cases during the first wave last year.Dr Nair says he has come across not more than 10 cases in Mumbai in the past two years. \\\"This year is something different,\\\" he says.In Bengaluru, Dr Hegde had never seen more than one or two cases a year in over a decade of practice.Patients suffering from the fungal infection typically have symptoms of stuffy and bleeding nose; swelling of and pain in the eye; drooping of eyelids; and blurred and finally, loss of vision. There could be black patches of skin around the nose.Doctors say most of their patients arrive late, when they are already losing vision, and doctors have to surgically remove the eye to stop the infection from reaching the brain.In some cases, doctors in India say, patients have lost their vision in both eyes. And in rare cases, doctors have to surgically remove the jaw bone in order to stop the disease from spreading.An anti-fungal intravenous injection which costs 3,500 rupees ($48) a dose and has to be administered every day for up to eight weeks is the only drug effective against the disease.One way to stall the possibility of the fungal infection was to make sure that Covid-19 patients - both in treatment and after recovery - were being administered the right dose and duration of steroids, says Dr Rahul Baxi, a Mumbai-based diabetologist.He says he treated some 800 diabetic Covid-19 patients in the past year, and none of them contracted the fungal infection. \\\"Doctors should take care of the sugar levels after the patients are discharged,\\\" Dr Baxi told me.A senior government official says there is \\\"no big outbreak\\\". Yet it is difficult to say why a growing number of cases of mucormycosis are being reported from all over the country. \\\"The strain of the virus appears to be virulent, sending blood sugars soaring to very high levels. And strangely, the fungal infection is affecting a lot of young people,\\\" says Dr Hegde.His youngest patient last month was a 27-year-old man, who was not even a diabetic. \\\"We had to operate on him during his second week of Covid-19 and remove his eye. It's pretty devastating.\\\"","postDate":"2021-05-09T01:37:12.000Z","title":"Mucormycosis: The 'black fungus' maiming Covid patients in India - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-india-57027829"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/11E91\/production\/_118316337_wetv1.png","author":"By Tessa Wong","description":"Being kicked out of a reality TV show might not be something to celebrate, but for one Russian man it was a dream come true - and the latest twist in his unlikely journey to becoming an icon for Chinese slackers.Vladislav Ivanov - better known by his stage name Lelush - is one of the hottest stars of the Chinese internet at the moment.Hashtags and memes featuring his sulky, bored face dominate social media, as thousands of youths have embraced the 27-year-old model as the new symbol of \\\"sang wenhua\\\", a youth sub-culture centred on pessimism and apathy.It all began when he made the worst - but also possibly the best - decision of his life.Trapped in a TV showEarlier this year, Lelush was asked to give Chinese lessons to two Japanese contestants in Chuang 2021, a reality TV competition aimed at creating China's next boy band sensation.The Russian model, who is fluent in the language after living in China for several years, agreed.But Lelush's good looks did not escape the notice of the show's producers. Days before the show began in early February, they asked him: would he like to join as well?Figuring he had nothing to lose - in later interviews he said he \\\"felt like trying out a new life\\\" - Lelush said yes.As one of the show's 90 contestants, he was promptly enrolled in boy band boot camp - hours upon hours of singing and dance classes, with his every move broadcast to the rest of China.According to reports, contestants could not leave their accommodation on the island of Hainan, and were cut off from the online world. They had no access to computers and even had to hand over their mobile phones.This was clearly not what Lelush had expected - and he was brutally honest about it.\\\"I don't want to dance. I'm also not suitable for a boy band too. So I'm really very tired. I want to go home this month,\\\" he bluntly stated in one interview.But there was not much of a way out - the contract contestants had signed reportedly carried a hefty fine if they decided to leave. The only way they could escape was if they got voted out.And so, Lelush decided to be the worst contestant ever on Chuang 2021.Week after week he slept in late, sulked through his interviews, and listlessly took part in classes, taking every opportunity to slack off during rehearsals.For his stage performances, while other contestants crooned romantic ballads or performed energetic dance numbers, he mumbled his way through a mournful Russian rap - twice.To his exasperation, the audience loved it all - his dourness, his deadpan answers, his low-key frustration at being trapped in a 21st Century Kafkaesque nightmare.The show's directors, sensing he was ratings gold, played up his reluctance in their edits of episodes. Meanwhile his ever-growing fanbase - who christened themselves \\\"sun si\\\", or \\\"mean fans\\\" - voted for him repeatedly to ensure he remained in the show for weeks, grimacing and gyrating for their viewing pleasure.Thus, like an unwilling phoenix half-heartedly flapping out of the ashes, a new star of Chinese slackerdom was born.Disillusioned rejectionExpressed largely in online memes and jokes - but also now a marketing trend that sells bubble tea, among other things - China's \\\"sang wenhua\\\", or \\\"sang\\\" culture, is a movement that ironically celebrates aimlessness and hopelessness. Its name uses a Chinese character that means \\\"loss\\\".Previous poster boys have included a popular Chinese actor slumped on a sofa, Pepe the Frog (which, unlike elsewhere, is not considered a right-wing symbol in China), Bojack Horseman, and even a lazy Japanese fried egg mascot.Slouching its way into the public eye about five years ago, it emerged as a disillusioned rejection of China's achievement-oriented culture epitomised in recent years by the Chinese Communist Party's \\\"positive energy\\\" propaganda slogan.Faced with worse inequality and unemployment rates compared to previous generations, and rising housing prices in major cities, many youths have found traditional goals such as getting a job and owning a home becoming increasingly unattainable, say experts.\\\"Much of China has been lifted out of poverty, but youths' desires to fulfill their dreams, that has become increasingly difficult because there's a greater level of social inequality than seen in their parents and grandparents' generations,\\\" says Dr K Cohen Tan, associate professor of digital media and cultural studies at University of Nottingham Ningbo China.\\\"So it's a huge barrier, but at the same time there are still these expectations [to do well.\\\"\\\"Sang\\\" culture thus represents \\\"an illusory utopia where youths can escape from their exhausting, anxiety-ridden everyday lives\\\", says Dr Hui Faye Xiao, associate professor of modern Chinese literature and culture at the University of Kansas.Lelush's slacker ethos was particularly relevant for a 2021 Chinese audience, whose \\\"sense of powerlessness has been further heightened during the pandemic\\\", Dr Xiao tells the BBC.Lelush memes have flourished online, while phrases that he often used on the show - \\\"I'm really tired\\\", \\\"when do we finish class\\\" and \\\"I want to go on leave\\\" - have gone viral.In particular, Dr Tan says, Lelush's frustration about having to work hard on the show mirrored many young people's \\\"sense of defeatism\\\" about China's notorious gruelling \\\"996\\\" work culture - so-called for people who work from nine in the morning to nine in the evening, six days a week.\\\"This sense of entrapment, of helplessness, is what many young people feel - they work very long hours, but are unable to quit even though they would love to,\\\" he tells the BBC.One turning point was when Lelush was graded F for a lacklustre performance, to which he declared: \\\"F is for freedom.\\\"In an instant, he turned a prospect that many Chinese youths dread - getting a bad grade - into an ironic rallying cry embodying \\\"the desire to be liberated from the pressures that many face themselves\\\", says Dr Tan.'If you love me, don't support me'But perhaps the only person who hated Lelush's journey to become a slacker icon was Lelush himself.\\\"If you love me, please don't support me,\\\" he pleaded with fans, in video after video filmed for the show.His wish was finally granted late two weekends ago when, to his utter relief, he finally got voted out of Chuang 2021 after three long months on the show.Footage of that episode showed him waving onstage along with other contestants, then dashing headlong towards the exit, with show staff in hot pursuit.Shortly afterwards a new post popped up on his official Weibo account, though it's not known if it was penned by him or the show's producers: \\\"Thank you everyone for your support, I finally get to knock off work.\\\"Since leaving the show he has kept a low profile, saying little to the media. He did not respond to the BBC's requests for an interview.He refused to tell Chinese news outlets what his next steps were, only cryptically saying: \\\"I don't want to constrain my freedom.\\\"But there are signs that he intends to cash in on his newfound fame. Over the weekend he plugged a mobile phone game on his Weibo account - with the ironic hashtag \\\"Lelush working on Labour Day\\\" - and has been offered a deal with another game developer.And of course, China's newly-crowned slacker god appears to be enjoying a well-deserved break.This week Lelush posted on Instagram a photo of himself lounging in bed, saying in a mixture of English, Mandarin and Russian: \\\"Finally resting and relaxing.\\\"Additional reporting by Waiyee Yip.You might also be interested in:","postDate":"2021-05-06T00:06:32.000Z","title":"Lelush: How a sulky Russian model became China's slacker icon - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-china-56967923"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/5D1A\/production\/_118243832_img_6688.jpg","author":"By Zlata Onufrieva and Kateryna Khinkulova","description":"Arina and Nina used to only meet once a week - at activities organised for the care home where Nina lived. Now, Arina is applying to become Nina's guardian, giving the 27-year-old hope she might finally be able to leave the institution where she has lived her entire adult life.For the past few months Nina Torgashova has been able to enjoy an independence that had always been out of reach for her - shopping, cooking and washing her own clothes.Things that would be every-day life experiences for most 27-year-olds.But not for Nina, who has always lived in institutions, and moved when she was 18 to what, in Russia, is called a psycho-neurological care home. When the pandemic hit, she was able to savour life outside the home, with a volunteer, Arina Muratova.Nina recalls the moment she found out she was leaving.\\\"I never thought anyone would take me. I had thought: \\\"Oh no, I am going to be stuck in the care home.\\\"It was April 2020 and the Covid-19 pandemic forced Moscow into lockdown. As visits to Nina's institution were stopped, charities lobbied for volunteers to be allowed to take responsibility for some of the residents until they could start up again.Arina, a market research expert who loves nail art and embroidery, offered to look after Nina.But when the 27-year-old got a taste for the freedom she'd never had, she decided she didn't want to go back.Her 31-year-old friend was faced with a life-changing decision.Arina has been involved in voluntary work for a decade - starting with helping children with learning difficulties and their families. She then became involved in adult care, which is when she met Nina through a Russian charity called Life Route. The charity organises trips and classes for the residents of some Russian psycho-neurological care homes (known as PNIs).Arina started volunteering in PNI 22 - where Nina was living with hundreds of other residents - about four years ago. The care home looks after adults with a wide range of disorders, thought to relate to both cognitive disabilities and mental illness of varying severity.Nina's diagnosis remains confidential to everyone except her care home director. This is usually the case for those residents the state judges are unable to live independently. So neither she nor Arina know why she is in the home, but Arina is surprised that she is.Although Nina struggles with literacy and maths, Arina says she is very capable.\\\"She is such a quick learner and is well-adapted in everyday living,\\\" she says.Nina was admitted to a home for disabled children when she was very young, before transferring to the PNI at 18. It is not clear whether she was taken to the children's home by her parents or was forcibly removed from their care.She says they visited her there once, but she was frightened and hid under the bed.\\\"They were drunks. I was afraid. They stank of alcohol,\\\" she says.Arina says Nina always stood out during her visits with Life Route, taking an active role in the activities and trips organised by the charity.\\\"Nina was a very active person at her care home,\\\" says Arina. \\\"She took part in various creative activities: amateur dramatics, arts and crafts workshops. She took part in sporting competitions, too: she played darts, she played football. Football was something she really missed after leaving the home.\\\"When the lockdown last spring made these visits impossible, Arina suggested Zoom calls with the residents instead. But from the start is was clear this wasn't going to work - the home's internet simply wasn't strong enough. Other charities helping other care homes in Moscow and St Petersburg were facing similar problems.So these charities pressured the authorities to allow some care home residents to be released for the lockdown.\\\"It was all arranged in a day, and the next day the person was out. I cannot imagine anything like this before the pandemic,\\\" says Life Route's director Ivan Rozhansky.Nevertheless Arina admits she was nervous when she made the initial decision to look after Nina. She was counting on Nina's relative independence, given she needed to work from home.\\\"There was a certain calculation in taking Nina. I had a lot of work to do, even during the lockdown. I realised I had to live with someone who'd be able to occupy themselves - at least some the time. With Nina it was clear that I'd be able to say: 'Now I have to work for three hours but afterwards we can make lunch together!'\\\"But Nina's move into the flat the charity had given the pair to live in during lockdown did get off to a slightly rocky start.\\\"She had very few possessions with her, just a small rucksack. She looked lost. While I was signing papers brought by the care worker, she walked around the flat. She didn't look especially overjoyed, and I had been counting on that.\\\"When I saw Nina looking so lost, I wondered if this had been a good idea. It's one thing to ask a person in a text if they want to move, but it's quite different to actually move them.\\\"But not long afterwards, Arina shared a selfie with the other volunteers of herself with a grinning Nina, arms raised in joy.Not only did Nina start shopping for food and cooking for herself, Arina arranged for her to have a maths tutor - important now she was buying things on her own.\\\"It's not that Nina doesn't understand things. She just never needed maths before,\\\" Arina says.Arina herself began helping Nina with her literacy - she could read and write, but slowly and with difficulty.\\\"I need to be able to read and write,\\\" says Nina. \\\"To be able to cook for myself, to go to work. I do want to have a job.\\\"I could make and sell friendship bracelets. I asked Arina: 'Do you know anyone who might want one?' She asked her mum, her mum was quite keen. I said: 'I will sort this!' Her mum picked the colours, Arina showed me a photo [of the colours], and I started making it.\\\"Arina says she wanted to make sure she gave Nina responsibility for herself, rather than always taking charge, even if this did not always go to plan.She cites the example of Nina wanting to learn to draw. Arina found another volunteer who could teach her over Zoom, and explained to Nina that she should make sure she joined the lessons. But after a while she discovered Nina had been missing some sessions.\\\"I don't want to chase another grown-up and pester them,\\\" says Arina. \\\"I felt this was the kind of responsibility Nina could sustain, and we had conflicts around it.\\\"But on another occasion Arina wanted to be more involved in Nina's life than regulations allowed.Nina had complained of a terrible stomach ache and was admitted to hospital for several days of tests. Arina was not allowed to stay with her because she was not a relative or guardian.\\\"Pleas, send Nina some reassuring messages,\\\" she texted to the volunteer group chat. \\\"Poor thing's terrified, she is having a third blood test and is scared.\\\"Thankfully there was nothing seriously wrong.As the Moscow lockdown eased in June, the Life Route charity was faced with a challenge.\\\"It became obvious that those people our foundation took to the assisted living flats for the duration of the quarantine did not want to go back to the PNI,\\\" says Ivan Rozhansky, the charity's director.These institutions have been a focus of concern for some time.In early 2019, Russia's deputy prime minister Tatiana Golikova ordered an inspection of living conditions in 192 psycho-neurological care homes. A consumer watchdog, Rospotrebnadzor, discovered violations of health and safety and other regulations in around 80% of them.In January of this year Russia's Ministry of Labour introduced a number of structural changes to the provision of care for those in PNIs, including a move to help social workers provide assistance for some people in private homes rather than in state institutions.\\\"Obviously, all these changes will not be realised immediately on January 1, 2021, but step-by-step the situation will be changing,\\\" Golikova said.Cramped conditionsMaria Sisneva from the charity Stop PNI says the quality of life in Russian care homes is poor.\\\"At a PNI you will have 500-1,000 people living in close quarters, but with very different levels of ability, and different backgrounds, different needs. They live in extremely cramped conditions, at best they'd be two to a small room, often in corridors, in spaces similar to military barracks, isolated from the outside world. They barely have any real social experience.\\\"The director of PNI 22, where Nina was living, is clear about the benefits of care homes, however.\\\"The main advantage of psycho-neurological homes is security,\\\" says Anton Kliuchev. \\\"The residents are looked after by professionals, who know exactly how to help and support them, how to talk to them, how to take care of them.\\\"Care homes for people with specialist needs and mental illness exist all over the world. But from the mid-20th Century in the US and some European countries, a process of deinstitutionalisation started, aimed at replacing long-stay closed facilities with care within the community. Yet, in Russia care homes are still the predominant model.According to Russian government statistics, as of February 2020 there were more than 150,000 people living in PNIs.Unlike many countries, Russia's assisted living provision is only in its infancy. National charities believe that if this alternative system were more established, many care home residents could leave their institutions.\\\"Right now the system in Russia is such that if a person is believed to be insufficiently independent by the state, there is nowhere for them to go apart from a PNI, or [for those with physical disabilities] an invalids' home,\\\" says Sisneva.Life Route began to discuss how the assisted living arrangement could be made permanent for the nine people they rehoused during lockdown. The charity rented four apartments, including one for Nina to share with fellow care home residents Sergey and Ivan. Arina moved back to her own apartment, and began instead to spend one night a week at Nina's new accommodation on rotation with other volunteers.But there was another hurdle.The PNI can only release their residents' care permanently to Life Route if those people have what is termed \\\"legal capacity\\\" - in other words, the state considers them able to function independently in theory, even if in practice they are in a care home.Nina does not have legal capacity - all decisions about her life are made for her by the director of her PNI. As Nina is so functionally able, it is not clear why this is, though experts say it can be simply a foible of the system. If, like Nina, someone has arrived from previous care such as a children's home, and has never been properly assessed, their legal status might never be challenged.So Arina has applied to become Nina's guardian.\\\"One day it just sort of clicked. And I realised I had to do it.\\\"If her request is granted, Arina will become responsible for every element of Nina's life - financial, practical, emotional and medical. As her guardian the PNI will finally share Nina's diagnosis with her.The process won't be straightforward, she says, involving extensive financial, physical and psychological check-ups on Arina.\\\"Emotionally [the decision] wasn't easy either,\\\" says Arina. \\\"But once I took Nina out of the care home, she became my responsibility.\\\"This all-consuming obligation might explain why there are so few people who volunteer to become legal guardians in Russia.While Arina waits to be granted Nina's guardianship, the PNI could demand that Nina - whose state benefits they are currently losing out on - return to them at any time.Meanwhile, Arina says she is still working out the exact role she plays in Nina's life.\\\"I can never be Nina's mum. I will never be able to give her the childhood she deserved.\\\"But she accepts that Nina sees her as much more than a friend. Nina expects her presence on all important errands: to the dentist, to get her ears pierced, to get registered at the local GP.And these new responsibilities have come at a time when life has been tough for Arina in other ways.\\\"It wasn't just Nina who went through a big emotional change. I went through a lot emotionally, too - during this time my salary was cut; I have had complicated developments in my personal life.\\\"But Arina says all this has brought them closer together.\\\"Once you have gone through all these experiences [alongside another person], it is hard to backpedal.\\\"I won't say I'm not anxious about it. I'm incredibly anxious. And there are certain people around me who freak me out even more. They keep asking me. 'Have you thought it through? It's for life!'\\\"I calm myself down by saying that we have a plan.\\\"That plan is to work towards eventually restoring Nina's full legal capacity.Nina needs to be deemed independent by the state if she ever wants to live alone or get a job.Other than Arina, she has one other close relationship - with a man called Sasha, who she met in PNI 22, and who is now in assisted living in a different apartment. Nina regularly meets up with Sasha in the city, and is clearly fond of him. Arina is aware that Nina may want to eventually marry and she would need legal capacity for that too.So Arina hopes Nina's tutoring will give her the option to be assessed at some point.\\\"Examiners look closely at a person's reading, writing and counting abilities,\\\" Arina has heard.The process is not publicly available but anecdotal accounts suggest it can include everything from being expected to dance or sing a song, or even know the price of a loaf of bread.Arina says they won't apply for Nina to take this test until she is as prepared as she can be.In the meantime, Arina is involved in all the important moments of Nina's life.\\\"Maybe I'm just the type of person that is not afraid of responsibility. It is an unexpected - but actually a good thing - that has happened to me.\\\"I love her. There's not much to it. I love her very much.\\\"My Friend from a Care Home is available to watch now on YouTube.-","postDate":"2021-05-01T23:07:27.000Z","title":"The young woman trying to adopt her friend - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-56919234"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/17702\/production\/_118320069_gettyimages-1232646215.jpg","author":"By Vikas Pandey","description":"On Monday, a senior official from India's federal government told journalists that there was no shortage of oxygen in Delhi or anywhere else in the country.As he spoke, several small hospitals - only a few miles from where he stood in the capital - were sending out desperate messages about them running out of oxygen, putting patients' lives at risk.The chief doctor of one of the hospitals - a specialist paediatric facility - told the BBC that \\\"our hearts were in our mouths\\\" because of the risk of children dying. They got supplies just in time, after a local politician intervened.And yet, the federal government has repeatedly insisted that there was no shortage. \\\"We are only facing problems in its transportation,\\\" Piyush Goyal, a senior official from India's home ministry, said.He also advised hospitals to \\\"ensure judicious use of oxygen as per the guidelines\\\". Several doctors who have spoken to the BBC say they are giving oxygen only to patients who need it, but there is not enough.But experts say that the shortage of oxygen is just one of the problems which shows both federal and state governments were not prepared, having failed to do enough to stop or minimise the damage of the second wave.Warnings have in fact been repeatedly issued, including:Despite this, on 8 March, the country's health minister announced that India was in the \\\"endgame of the pandemic\\\".So, where did it go so wrong?The basicsIn January and February, the national number of daily cases fell to under 20,000 from peaks of around 90,000 in September last year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared Covid beaten, and all places of public gathering opened.And soon, people were not adhering to Covid safety protocols, thanks in part to confused messaging from the top.While Mr Modi asked people to wear masks and follow social distancing in his public messages, he addressed large unmasked crowds during his election campaigns in five states. A number of his ministers were also seen addressing large public gatherings without wearing masks. The Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival - which attracts millions - was also allowed to go ahead.\\\"There was complete disconnect between what they practised and what they preached,\\\" says public policy and health systems expert Dr Chandrakant Lahariya.Prominent virologist Dr Shahid Jameel says \\\"the government just did not see the second wave coming and started celebrating too early\\\".But there is more to the story: the devastation has also exposed the underfunding and neglect of the public healthcare system in India.The heart-breaking scenes that have been witnessed outside hospitals - people dying without getting treatment - shows the grim reality of India's healthcare infrastructure.As one expert puts it, India's \\\"public health infrastructure was always broken, the rich and the middle class are just finding out\\\". Those who could afford it have always relied on private hospitals for treatment, while the poor struggle to get even a doctor's appointment.Recent schemes, like health insurance and subsidised medicines for the poor, are not helping because very little has been done in decades to increase the number of medical staff or hospitals.India's healthcare spending, including both private and public, has been around 3.6% of GDP for the past six years, the lowest percentage in the five Brics countries: Brazil spent the most at 9.2%, followed by South Africa at 8.1%, Russia at 5.3% and China at 5% in 2018.Developed nations spend a far higher proportion of their GDP on health. In 2018, for instance, spending in the US was 16.9% and Germany 11.2%. Even smaller nations like Sri Lanka (3.76%) and Thailand (3.79%) spend more than India.And India has fewer than 10 doctors per 10,000 people, and in some states the figure is less than five.PreparationSeveral \\\"empowered committees\\\" were last year looking at the preparations needed to tackle the next coronavirus wave, so experts are baffled by the shortages of oxygen, beds and drugs.\\\"When the first wave was tapering, that's when they should have prepared for a second wave and assumed the worst. They should have taken an inventory of oxygen and [the drug] remdesivir and then ramped up manufacturing capacity,\\\" Mahesh Zagade, former health secretary of Maharashtra state, told the BBC.Officials say India produces enough oxygen to meet the spike in demand but transportation was the problem. Experts say this should have been fixed much earlier.The government is now running special trains carrying oxygen from one state to another and stopping use of oxygen in industries - but only after many patients died because of a lack of oxygen.\\\"The outcome has been that desperate family members are spending thousands of rupees to secure an oxygen cylinder on the black market and then stand for hours in a queue to get it filled,\\\" points out Dr Lahariya.Meanwhile, those who can afford it are also paying hefty amounts to procure drugs like remdesivir and tocilizumab.An executive from a pharmaceutical company which manufactures remdesivir said \\\"demand had dried up\\\" in January and February. \\\"If the government had placed an order, we would have stockpiled and there wouldn't have been any shortage. We have ramped up production but demand has grown significantly,\\\" he said.In contrast, the southern state of Kerala planned for the surge in advance. Dr A Fathahudeen, who is part of the state's Covid taskforce, says there was no shortage of oxygen in the state as necessary steps were taken in October last year.\\\"We also procured sufficient stock of remdesivir and tocilizumab and other drugs well in advance. We also have a surge plan in place to tackle any exponential rise in the numbers in the coming weeks,\\\" he says.Mr Zagade says other states should have also taken similar steps \\\"to avoid the suffering\\\".\\\"Learning means someone else has done it and you can do it now, but that means it will take time,\\\" the former health secretary for Maharashtra said.But time is running out as the second wave is now spreading to villages where healthcare systems are not equipped to deal with the surge.PreventionGenome sequencing of the virus is an important step in identifying new variants that could be more infectious and deadly. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG) was set up last year and it brought together 10 labs in the country.But the group reportedly struggled to get funding initially. Virologist Dr Jameel says India started seriously looking at mutations fairly late, with sequencing efforts only \\\"properly started\\\" in mid-February 2021.India is sequencing just over 1% of all samples at the moment. \\\"In comparison, the UK was sequencing at 5-6% at the peak of the pandemic. But you can't build such capacity overnight,\\\" he said.However, India's main hope was always vaccination.\\\"Any public health specialist will tell you there is no practical way to strengthen an already broken public healthcare system in a matter of months,\\\" one woman, whose family runs a large private hospital in Delhi, told the BBC.\\\"The best and most effective alternative to battle Covid was to vaccinate the population as quickly as possible so the majority wouldn't need hospital care and hence not overburden the healthcare system.\\\"India initially wanted 300 million people vaccinated by July, \\\"but it seems the government did not do enough planning to secure vaccine supply to run the programme\\\", Dr Lahariya says.\\\"On top of it, it has opened the vaccination for all adults without securing vaccine supplies.\\\"So far, only about 26 million people have been fully vaccinated out of a population of 1.4 billion, and about 124 million have received a single dose. India has millions more doses on order, but still far short of what it actually needs.The federal government needs 615 million doses to vaccinate everyone above the age of 45 - about 440 million people. There are 622 million people between the age of 18 and 44, and 1.2 billion doses are required to vaccinate them.The government has also cancelled exports, reneging on international commitments.The government has enlisted other firms like Biological E and the state-run Haffkine Institute to produce vaccines. It has also given credit support of $609m to the Serum Institute of India, which produces the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab which is being made in India as Covishield, to ramp up production.But that funding should have come earlier, Dr Lahariya says, saving precious lives. \\\"It will take months before we have enough vaccines to speed up the programme. In the meantime, millions will continue to be at risk of getting Covid,\\\" he adds.Experts say it is ironic that India is known as the world's pharmacy and it is now facing shortages of vaccines and drugs.All of this, Dr Lahariya says, should serve as wake-up call for for both federal and state governments, which should invest drastically more in the healthcare sector because \\\"this definitely is not the last pandemic we will have to fight against\\\".\\\"The future pandemic may come earlier than any model can predict,\\\" he says.","postDate":"2021-05-05T06:18:12.000Z","title":"Coronavirus: How India descended into Covid-19 chaos - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-india-56977653"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/18638\/production\/_118169899_3stephands.jpg","author":"BBC Trending","description":"A charismatic anti-vaccination campaigner has gained popularity by claiming that medical science's approach to the pandemic is entirely wrong.

But Mr Chowdhury has used the pandemic to spread his messages.He teaches his followers that hospitals increase their chances of dying and says that Covid patients with breathing difficulties would do better sitting in front of a handheld fan than receiving oxygen.To his many critics, he is a dangerous fraud whose bad advice can only further fuel India's horrific second wave of coronavirus.\\\"Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury is a quack,\\\" says Dr Sumaiya Shaikh, science editor of the Indian fact-checking website Alt News. \\\"He has a huge following and that makes him even more dangerous.\\\"It's a following that has been cultivated through numerous books, online videos and courses and packed-out live events.YouTube, Twitter and Facebook banned Mr Chowdhury last year, but not before he assembled an army of followers - nearly one million on YouTube alone before his account was deleted.He still has official channels on WhatsApp and Telegram. Biswaroop's fans are also uploading and spreading his content on proxy accounts.WhatsApp told us they are working hard to limit the spread of false coronavirus information on their platform. Telegram didn't respond to a request for comment.A gift for publicityMr Chowdhury presents himself as a plucky underdog figure pitted against a medical establishment intent on deceiving the public.Covid-19 is \\\"just like normal flu\\\" he asserts - despite the fact it's actually significantly deadlier. And despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, he claims that face masks don't help stop the spread of virus and will actually make wearers ill.He has co-opted the Urdu word azaadi, meaning \\\"freedom\\\" - a rallying cry that resonates with many oppressed communities in India, for his slogan \\\"masks se azaadi\\\" (\\\"freedom from masks\\\").In one of his several coronavirus e-books, Mr Chowdhury offers 100,000 rupees (about £960; $1,300) to anyone who \\\"can prove that vaccines have ever helped anyone in any way\\\".There is, of course, a vast literature of medical research stretching back decades that documents how vaccines have helped control and even eradicate diseases all over the world. But Mr Chowdhury discounts it entirely.Diet cure claimsMr Chowdhury started developing his controversial diet \\\"cures\\\" about a decade ago.It's just one strand of a colourful and varied career. After training as an engineer, he dabbled in Bollywood film-making and even cast himself as the star in one movie.He is also the chief editor and founder of both the India and Asia Book of Records which is modelled on, but not affiliated with, the Guinness Book of Records.Nilesh Christopher, a journalist with the tech website Rest of World, says Mr Chowdhury became interested in nutrition when his wife couldn't shake a flu-like illness.\\\"What he told me was, he was running around from pillar to post, visiting doctors, and trying to figure out a cure for it, but he couldn't,\\\" he says. \\\"That is when he goes into this mode of self-learning and he claims to have read research papers and figured out this magic formula which is coconut water, citrus fruits and vegetables.\\\"The Anti-Vax FilesThe Anti-Vax Files: A new series from BBC Trending, on the World Service weekly from 05:30 GMT Saturday.

He set up a consultation service where patients are charged 500 rupees (£4.80; $6.70) to receive a diet plan.\\\"He's built a massive digital empire through online nutrition courses, certification programmes and consultancy services and that's his business model,\\\" says Mr Christopher. \\\"That doesn't change, no matter what the disease you throw at him.\\\"Mr Chowdhury says he has cured more than 50,000 people of Covid-19 without any fatalities. But Dr Arun Gupta, President of the Delhi Medical Council points out that most people will recover from the virus regardless of what they eat.\\\"If you claim you take 100 patients and I claim that I cure all of you, you see 97 per cent are going to get cured, even without any intervention,\\\" he says.Dr Gupta says more should be done to stop the spread of such misinformation. \\\"It is the responsibility of the government to take a note of it and make sure these people are contained,\\\" he says.Mr Chowdhury stands by his methods and rejects allegations that his teachings put people at risk.\\\"Are they giving any evidence? I don't think so,\\\" he told the BBC.Criminal complaintHowever, the nutritionist is under investigation for one specific claim that his methods have caused real life harm.Jaideep Bihani, from Delhi, has made a criminal complaint against Mr Chowdhury over the death of his mother Shanti in August 2017.Mr Bihani told the BBC he blamed Mr Chowdhury for her death \\\"100%\\\".Mrs Bihani, 56, was suffering from diabetes, and heart and thyroid problems. After discovering Mr Chowdhury on the web, Mr Bihani paid hundreds of dollars to take his mother to a three-day event to learn his diabetes cure.The event was held at a holistic sanctuary on the outskirts of Delhi. A video of the first evening shows Mr Chowdhury urging his audience to stop taking their medicines.\\\"I've got a box with me, it is called the medical orange box... All the medicines, we will put here and put a lock [on it]. So I hope you will never need those medicines again,\\\" he said.Mr Chowdhury told the audience that patients who were in very poor health, like Shanti Bihani, would be monitored and given back some medicine if needed - but that food would act as their primary medication going forward.\\\"The moment you have your first diet, that will make you heart attack proof from that time,\\\" he told the assembly.Mrs Bihani had been taking a range of medicines, but into the large orange box they went. The next day she complained of feeling drowsy and later collapsed. Eventually she was taken to hospital where she died after suffering a heart attack.In his criminal complaint, Mr Bihani accuses Mr Chowdhury of falsely claiming to be a medical practitioner, offering fraudulent treatments and failing to provide emergency care at the course. Mr Chowdhury denies all this.The most prominent qualification listed on Biswaroop's website is an honorary PHD in diabetes, from Alliance International University, Zambia. It's an institution that according to its website is headquartered not in Africa but in the Caribbean. This degree appears to be why Mr Chowdhury calls himself a doctor, although he didn't answer our questions about this issue.In response to Mr Bihani's allegations, a spokesperson for Mr Chowdhury told us that Mrs Bihani was a very ill woman who had been chewing paan masala, a mild but addictive stimulant made with areca nut and other substances. Her son denies that she was during the course.The spokesperson for Mr Chowdhury also said Mr Bihani had his mother's medications on him throughout the course. But Mr Bihani also denies this was the case.Mr Bihani said he hoped his experiences should be a warning to anybody thinking of following Mr Chowdhury's advice.\\\"Watching my father every day just alone at this age, and watching my kids not being there with grandmum - you know, I can't even tell you what I feel.\\\"With reporting from Shruti Menon in Delhi.Listen to The Anti-Vax Files from BBC Trending, on the World Service.

But officials say he reached a village on Monday, looking healthy.He reappeared in Basly, 32km (20 miles) from the hunting base.His all-terrain vehicle had been found 6.5km from the base in Pospelovo, another village. The doctor is now having a medical check, the Omsk government told Russian media.Last August Navalny collapsed on a flight and was treated in Omsk, then airlifted to Berlin. Western experts concluded that he had been poisoned with Novichok, a Russian military-grade nerve agent.Two senior doctors at the Omsk hospital died aged 55 and 63 this year.The hospital, headed by Dr Murakhovsky last year, insisted that it had found no trace of nerve agent while treating Navalny.The Kremlin has repeatedly denied allegations that Russian state agents tried to kill Navalny. Lab tests in three Western countries, confirmed by the global chemical weapons watchdog, established that Novichok had poisoned him.At the weekend police, an emergencies ministry team and volunteers searched a swampy forest about 2,200km (1,370 miles) east of Moscow for the missing doctor, who is currently health minister for the Omsk region.Navalny is the most prominent Russian critic of President Vladimir Putin, whom he accused of having ordered the Novichok attack.Since February Navalny has been in jail in a penal colony, serving a term of nearly three years for an old embezzlement case. He called the conviction fraudulent and politically motivated.The top medical team at the Omsk hospital which treated Navalny has changed since it was in the world media spotlight last year.A deputy to Dr Murakhovsky - intensive care specialist Dr Sergei Maximishin - died in February aged 55, from a heart attack.In March the hospital's traumatology chief, Dr Rustam Agishev, died aged 63. He had had a stroke in December.Dr Murakhovsky left in November, to head the Omsk regional health service.

In the UK , 67% of the population has received a first dose and in the US 56% of those eligible have had one jab.On Friday, the EU agreed to purchase 900 million more doses of Pfizer\\\/BioNTech vaccine, with the option for 900 million morePatent waiver versus export bansSouth Africa and India argue that surrendering patents would mean the secret vaccine recipes would be released and other countries could start producing the life-saving jabs, potentially lowering the cost. India is currently in the grip of a devastating second wave, which yesterday alone left more than 4,000 people dead.This week the US backed the proposed waiver.The plan also has the support of the World Health Organization (WHO) and Pope Francis, who said on Saturday the world was infected with the \\\"virus of individualism\\\", with \\\"the laws of... intellectual property\\\" put \\\"over the laws of love and the health of humanity\\\".Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had hoped to get the European Union's support, speaking to leaders who had gathered together on Saturday via video call.However, he failed to secure the backing he sought, with EU leaders remaining sceptical. Mr Macron argued increasing exports and production was the best way to solve the crisis.\\\"The key to produce vaccines more rapidly for all poor countries or intermediate countries is to produce more,\\\" Mr Macron said.He singled out the US in particular, calling on it to \\\"put an end to export bans not only on vaccines but on vaccine ingredients, which prevent production\\\".On Friday, Mr Macron had pointed to the fact that, so far, \\\"100% of the vaccines produced in the United States are for the American market\\\".The US - which has pledged to donate 60 million doses from its stockpile of AstraZeneca in the coming months - has imposed curbs on the export of the raw materials needed to produce the vaccines.Mr Macron noted the UK had also placed restrictions on vaccine exports. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously denied there is a ban, however publicly available information suggests vaccines are not being exported from the UK.Germany and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have voiced opposition to a waiver.Ms von der Leyen told reporters waiving intellectual property patents would \\\"not bring a single dose of vaccine in the short- and medium-term\\\", while Germany said it was not patents which were hindering production.Others have pointed to other issues with the waiver plan, which critics say strips financial rewards from cutting-edge drug developers.For example, BioNTech, the German company which partnered with Pfizer, say validating production sites to produce its vaccine can take up to a year.What is intellectual property?Intellectual property describes creations, such as inventions, which are protected by patents, copyrights and trademarks. These prevent copying and allow the originator to be financially rewarded.Patents give innovating firms a short-term monopoly on production to cover the costs of development and encourage investment.Biotech firms argue that such protection has provided incentives to produce Covid vaccines in record times.","postDate":"2021-05-08T18:22:47.000Z","title":"Covid: Macron calls on US to drop vaccine export bans - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-57039362"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/15773\/production\/_117632978_56457890.jpg","author":"BBC Trending","description":"False information from the mouths of politicians and preachers is reaching remote villages in the Amazon via WhatsApp, reports BBC News Brasil's Juliana Gragnani.A helicopter loaded with health workers and coronavirus vaccine doses took off from Labrea, in the southern part of the Amazon, heading to a village some 50km away.But the villagers, part of the indigenous Jamamadi group, greeted the chopper armed with bows and arrows - and demanded that it leave.They'd been hearing false rumours about vaccines and wanted reassurances from a religious missionary - not doctors - before getting jabbed. The helicopter left without administering any of the doses.Fragile relationshipThe incident in early February was described to BBC News Brasil by several sources who asked not to be identified for fear of upsetting the fragile relationship between health teams and indigenous people.The people we spoke to say that armed welcoming parties are very rare, but they are worried about vaccine rumours being spread to indigenous people through mobile phones.Many mobile phone operators in Brazil include free use of Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp in their payment plans, whereas use of other networks and websites incurs a cost.WhatsApp - a common source of community and family news - presents a particular problem, experts say.Information on chat apps tends to come from people closer to us, who we instinctively trust - but data packages discourage people, particularly the cash-strapped, from double-checking health information.Indigenous journalist Anapuaka Tupinamba says WhatsApp enabled \\\"a leap\\\" for indigenous people in the areas of politics and education, but calls technology \\\"a double-edged sword\\\".\\\"What we have today is a 'fake' internet. When you see fake news, you can't check it,\\\" Anapuaka says. \\\"So it feels like I'm on the internet, but not really. I'm almost on the intranet of a large company.\\\"Anapuaka cites one recent example circulated on the app - a story about 900 indigenous Xingu people dying after receiving a vaccine. It was false.Sources of infoMuch of the bad vaccine information circulating on WhatsApp originates not from the villagers themselves but from politicians and religious leaders.This includes Brazil's President.\\\"Nobody can force me to get the vaccine,\\\" Jair Bolsonaro said in September. The following month, he declared: \\\"The Brazilian people will not be anyone's guinea pig\\\". He wasn't going to get the vaccine, he said, \\\"and that's it.\\\"He appeared to echo bizarre and false claims, common in anti-vaccine groups online, about Covid vaccines altering people's DNA.\\\"If you become an alligator, it's your problem \\u2026 if a woman grows a beard or a man starts to speak with a thin voice, they [pharmaceutical companies] will have nothing to do with it.\\\"It was those kinds of statements that resonated most with indigenous communities, says Indianara Machado, a nurse from Brazil's Central-West region.\\\"People in the village ask themselves: 'If the president didn't take it [the vaccine], how are we going to take it?'\\\" she says.'The beast's chip'Religious missionaries and evangelical churches have influence in indigenous territories, and some - though certainly not all - have also spread vaccine falsehoods.Indianara Machado says that many of the videos that went viral were of indigenous pastors holding services telling people not to get the vaccine, declaring it was \\\"the beast's microchip\\\" - calling to mind fake rumours that vaccines include chips that can track and enslave people.Pastor Henrique Terena, president of the National Council of Evangelical Indigenous Pastors and Leaders, admits that in the Central-West region there is \\\"a neo-Pentecostal segment that says that vaccines are not good, that they are from the devil, and they tell their members they shouldn't get the jab.\\\"But he says his members are by and large not the problem, and he says anti-vaccine pastors only \\\"claim\\\" to be evangelical.The Anti-Vax FilesThe Anti-Vax Files: A new series from BBC Trending, on the World Service from 05:30 GMT Saturday. Download the podcast or listen onlineVideo disinformationOnline misinformation convinced Joel Paumari's parents that Covid vaccines were unsafe. He's a teaching coordinator in the Amazon region, and his concern for his parents grew as he saw a rise in the number of deaths of indigenous people.According to official figures, more than 650 indigenous people living in villages have died due to Covid-19 out of a total population of 517,000. Across Brazil, around 400,000 people have died. In raw numbers, the country's death toll is second only to the United States.Joel says that his parents saw videos that included false claims about drugs, about vaccines \\\"distancing\\\" people from God, and those rumours about DNA and genetic codes. All of them were untrue.It took three days of pleading WhatsApp voice notes to convince his parents to take the jab - and while they did in the end, Joel's brother did not.Limited forwardingAudio, text and videos with disinformation have spread across Brazilian WhatsApp groups for years, and played a part in the 2018 elections.Since then, the company has limited message sharing to five times and inserted a tag that shows when a message has been forwarded multiple times.WhatsApp told BBC News Brasil that since it's encrypted, the company doesn't have access to the content of the messages. And the company says it has acted to combat misinformation, for instance by launching free services with information about Covid-19 within the app.Vaccine hesitationStill, disinformation appears to be having an impact on vaccine uptake in indigenous villages.The villagers are a priority group when it comes to Covid vaccination, and statistics indicate that 75% have received at least one vaccine dose.But that lags behind other recent vaccine drives.BBC News Brasil obtained, via Brazil's Access to Information law, data on the immunisation of indigenous people in Brazil since 2011. We found that virtually all previous vaccines drives had a 90% take-up rate.After a decade-long campaign to build trust, take-up of the flu vaccine reached 90% in 2019. What's more, that level was reached within a month. By contrast, the current Covid-19 campaign began in mid-January - more than three months ago.The government remains optimistic, however. The office of Brazil's Special Secretary for Indigenous Health noted that it has a workforce of 14,000 indigenous health professionals.\\\"Indigenous vaccination continues at a favourable pace,\\\" it said.MissionariesThe Jamamadi - who met the helicopter armed with bows and arrows - are one group who've been strongly influenced by missionaries from the United States in recent decades.By contrast, according to anthropologist Miguel Aparicio, the Banawa people, who are neighbours to the Jamamadi, have been fully vaccinated.The difference? \\\"The missionary presence within the Banawa is not strong,\\\" he says.But a few days after the rejection of the jabs, a Jamamadi chief made contact with health officials saying he wanted to get the vaccine.The team returned and vaccinated some villagers. But that's not quite the end of the story - most of the Jamamadi have not yet had a jab.Follow Juliana on TwitterListen to The Anti-Vax Files from BBC Trending, on the World Service.

But his fall from grace is so pronounced, Mr Vaishnav says, because, unlike former US President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, he was not a \\\"Covid denier\\\". And yet he failed to prevent what happened, despite the warning signs.Mr Modi allowed a Hindu festival where millions gathered on the banks of the Ganges river over several weeks for a holy dip. He insisted on a month-long election in West Bengal state and campaigned unmasked at massive rallies, marvelling at the size the crowds.\\\"These displays of negligence or defiance were shocking to see from parts of the world which had seen lockdowns recently,\\\" says Alex Travelli, The Economist's India correspondent.They were also a vivid reminder of Mr Modi's brand - a strong, popular leader of an overwhelmingly Hindu country - and the Indian exceptionalism that he touted to the world in January.\\\"For foreign observers, his nationalist impulses were always paired with a sense of technocratic competence. But technocratic competence has been entirely missing from the [Covid] response,\\\" says Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the State University of New York.Mr Modi's reputation as a both a populist leader and a vigilant administrator started to fray in 2016 when a disastrous currency ban knocked down millions of Indians who largely relied on cash. Then, last year, he shut down the country overnight to stop the spread of Covid - but again, millions lost jobs and many lost their lives. India's economy is still reeling from all of this.Mr Modi's defence was that there was a greater good at stake, be it flushing out illegal cash or beating Covid. But this latest misstep cannot be explained away easily, says Ravi Agrawal, editor-in-chief of Foreign Policy.\\\"You can explain away numbers like GDP, but you can't explain away a brother's death,\\\" he says. \\\"Indians have always believed that although Modi makes mistakes, he still fights for them, he believes in them.\\\"But this time, he says, they are questioning his intent. \\\"There is a crack, a very visible crack in the edifice, the facade that is Modi.\\\"The making - and unmaking - of a brand\\\"Modi means business\\\" declared a Time magazine cover in 2012.Back in 2002, more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, died in riots that erupted in Gujarat state after 60 Hindus were killed in a train fire. Mr Modi, who was then the chief minister of the state, was accused of allowing the riots. He denied any wrongdoing and came out unscathed.By 2012, the Gujarat chief minister was \\\"a paragon of good governance and effective administration\\\" for his supporters. Other coverage dubbed him an \\\"autocratic loner\\\" and \\\"a poor delegator\\\", but a \\\"refreshing\\\" change under whom \\\"Gujarat bloomed\\\" and \\\"business flourished\\\". His bid for PM, after a 13-year stint heading Gujarat, was seen as an opportunity to \\\"revitalise\\\" India's economy. The BJP was taking a risk on the \\\"polarising\\\" Mr Modi, but his reputation as a \\\"no-nonsense administrator\\\" was part of his appeal.\\\"We got taken in by the relatively easy way it was to govern Gujarat,\\\" says Nilanjan Mukopadhyay, a journalist and Mr Modi's biographer.Brand new roads, power lines, lesser red tape and increased private investment in Gujarat impressed middle-class and wealthy voters. But Mr Mukhopadhyay says it wasn't a great feat to achieve in a prosperous state with a small population. And Gujarat's social indicators didn't improve much.\\\"We were all taken by this great aura of Modi. I made this error too. He once said we have a red carpet, not red tape. Where is the red carpet for the aid that is coming?\\\" (The aid has been stuck in customs, according to a series of damaging news reports.)The current crisis, observers say, has exposed the chinks in Mr Modi's armour. They say his centralised style of leadership seemed reassuring last year but proved hollow this time as he passed the buck to states. A generous vaccine strategy, which saw him donate doses to countries, now appears like careless grandstanding since India has forced its largest vaccine marker to renege on international commitments, which brought it funding. His strident majoritarianism, which so many voters admired, stops him from reaching out across the aisle for bipartisan solutions, experts say.\\\"He put his name and his stamp on everything. So when something goes wrong he has to take the fall. You can't have it both ways,\\\" Mr Agrawal says.Mr Modi built an impressive brand abroad too - \\\"He is at his best outside India,\\\" wrote one newspaper. He drew a \\\"roaring crowd\\\" at the iconic Madison Square Gardens and overshadowed former US President Donald Trump at the Howdy, Modi! gathering in Texas.\\\"He deployed this imagery of himself so aggressively,\\\" Mr Agrawal says. He was even called the \\\"most physically demonstrative Indian leader in years.\\\"His muscular nationalism was a balm for Indians at home and overseas, and promised the emergence of a superpower. Now, Mr Agrawal says, it is \\\"galling\\\" for Indians everywhere to see how their economic peers - Thailand, Vietnam, Bangladesh - have fared better against Covid.\\\"There's embarrassment among the diaspora that the country which they have got used to describing to their friends as a rising power is now being shown the way it is.\\\"Can Modi's image recover?\\\"He has proven to be an exceptionally resilient politician and political leader,\\\" Mr Vaishnav says.\\\"The man has recovered from some incredible nadirs already, I wouldn't count him out,\\\" Mr Travelli adds.The government is already in damage-control mode. It has taken offence to the bad press, sparred with opposition leaders and fumed at tweeters critical of its response.It has suggested a \\\"foreign conspiracy\\\" is afoot to discredit India, asked Twitter to take down posts it didn't like and then took to Twitter to thank and defend Mr Modi's leadership.But Mr Modi himself has been conspicuously absent, barring a tame address on 20 April.\\\"At the start of the pandemic, Modi knew how he wanted to look to India and the world,\\\" Mr Travelli says. \\\"He was styling himself as a general leading his people. But no equivalent posture is available to him at the moment. He doesn't have any interest in apologising or asking for help.\\\"Mr Modi has only been interviewed a handful of times since he became PM. He has never addressed a press conference, even during Covid.\\\"He doesn't want to be questioned,\\\" Mr Mukhopadhyay says.But questions are all anyone has - the poor, a traumatised middle class and the rich Indians who couldn't escape the huge gaps in healthcare, and even loyal party workers who can't quite grasp how the prime minister let this happen.Read more of our Covid coverage","postDate":"2021-05-08T00:36:28.000Z","title":"India's Covid crisis delivers a blow to brand Modi - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-india-56970569"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/9088\/production\/_118400073_d1097bf8-9010-488e-a185-abdff54198b2.jpg","author":"By Dharshini David","description":"When it comes to the pandemic, if there's anything world leaders agree on it's that no one is protected until everyone is.But they are struggling to agree on how to boost vaccine production amid a huge difference between vaccination rates in advanced and poorer nations.This week, the US voiced its support for a temporary lift on the patents on vaccinations. But some countries have pushed back, insisting there are better options.What is the row about?Medicines and other inventions are covered by patents which provide legal protection against being copied, and vaccines are no exception.Patents give makers the rights to their discoveries as well as the means to make more money from them - which is an incentive to encourage innovation.But these are not normal times.Last autumn, developing nations led by India and South Africa proposed to the World Trade Organization (WTO) that the patents on vaccinations and other Covid-related items should be waived.They argued that, given the extreme nature of the pandemic, the recipe for the life-saving jabs should be made widely available so they could be produced locally in bulk by other manufacturers.What's the problem?The proposals were met with immediate criticism from pharmaceutical companies and Western nations including the EU, UK and - at that point - the US.Most of the costs involved in coming up with vaccines are incurred in research and development: the manufacturing bit tends to cost less.The obvious objection to lifting patents is that it could erode revenue and deter innovation.So, does this just come down to money?No. The waiver would be temporary - and some vaccine makers like AstraZeneca are offering doses at cost.The key argument from vaccine producers and their home countries is that waiving patents alone wouldn't solve much. It would, they say, be like handing out a recipe without the ingredients or instructions.The patent covers the bare bones of the blue print but not the precise production process. That's crucial here. Vaccines of the mRNA type - such as Pfizer and Moderna - are a new breed and only a small number of people understand how to make them.BioNTech, the German company which partnered with Pfizer, have said that developing the manufacturing process took a decade and validating production sites can take up to a year. The availability of the raw materials needed has also been an issue.Industry bodies fear that without access to all the know-how and parts, a waiver could result in quality, safety and efficacy issues and possibly even counterfeits. They point out that Moderna has already said it would not prosecute those found to be infringing their patent - but no one has yet.What's the alternative?The EU says it is ready to talk, but it previously said the best short-term fix would be supply chain improvements and pushing richer countries to export more jabs.The UK says it is one of the biggest donors to Covax, which is masterminding the rollout of vaccines to many poorer countries. It also favours voluntary licensing - such as collaborations between the Serum Institute of India and Oxford-AstraZeneca. It wants the WTO, which oversees the rules on global trade, to support more partnerships.The WTO system allows for this licensing arrangement to go even further. Governments can impose compulsory licenses on vaccine makers, compelling them to share their know-how and overseeing the production process along the way. But those pharmaceutical companies would have to be compensated for doing so.Why did the US change its mind?The announcement came after the US Trade Representative Katharine Tai held meetings with the big vaccine makers in an effort to supercharge vaccine production.But some trade specialists must have queried if the move might be a negotiating tactic, to persuade vaccine makers to cooperate to a greater degree with licensing, either voluntarily or for a reduced charge.What happens next?Now the discussions will continue at the WTO where decisions are made by consensus.Without the backing of other key nations, the proposals may stall. But they may pave the way to a compromise that could boost production.The key question is when - and by how much.","postDate":"2021-05-06T18:24:09.000Z","title":"Covid: The vaccine patent row explained - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-57016260"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/10ACB\/production\/_118399286_hi067165245.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"Germany has voiced opposition to a US-backed proposal to waive patents on Covid-19 vaccines, saying they were not hindering production of the jabs.Its government said \\\"the protection of intellectual property is a source of innovation and must remain so\\\".The European Union earlier said it was ready to talk about the proposal, and some states gave it their full backing.Supporters of the plan say it will allow more manufactures to produce the life-saving vaccines.They argue that this will increase access to jabs in poorer countries.But opponents, including drug makers, say it may not have the desired effect.The idea was originally proposed by India and South Africa, who have been leading a group of about 60 countries at the World Trade Organization (WTO) - an intergovernmental body that promotes global commerce. The group is pushing for the temporary removal of intellectual property protections on vaccines.The proposal was met with strong opposition from the previous US administration of Donald Trump, as well as the UK and the EU.But it gained momentum this week after the US backed it.WTO head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told the BBC's Newshour programme that she welcomed US support for the waiver. She said members should negotiate a pragmatic agreement over vaccine production because the current inequity was \\\"not right\\\".Ms Okonjo-Iweala acknowledged the shortage of raw materials and technical expertise required on the ground, but said they would need to start somewhere to boost global supplies.Meanwhile in Germany, Health Minister Jens Spahn said the country would allow the AstraZeneca vaccine to be administered to all adults, reversing a previous decision to restrict the shot to people over the age of 60 because of concerns over rare blood clots seen in a tiny number of recipients. What have EU countries said?In a statement on Thursday, the German government said the US-backed proposal would have \\\"significant implications for vaccine production as a whole\\\".\\\"The limiting factors in the production of vaccines are the production capacities and the high quality standards and not patents,\\\" it said, adding that pharmaceutical companies were already working with partners to ramp up manufacturing.Germany is the EU's biggest economic power and home to a major pharmaceutical sector, including BioNTech which developed one of the most widely-used coronavirus vaccines.The remarks by the German government came after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc was \\\"ready to discuss\\\" the proposal on waiving patents.Ms von der Leyen has previously spoken about her opposition to lifting intellectual property rights, telling the New York Times just weeks ago that she was \\\"not at all a friend of releasing patents\\\".Meanwhile, officials in other member states such as France and Italy gave the proposal their full backing.The issue is reportedly set to be on the agenda at a two-day EU meeting this week.Outside of the EU, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he supported the idea of a waiver.The UK government said it was \\\"working with WTO members to resolve this issue\\\" and was \\\"in discussions with the US and WTO members to facilitate increased production and supply of Covid-19 vaccines\\\".What exactly is intellectual property?Intellectual property describes creations, such as inventions, which are protected by patents, copyrights and trademarks. These prevent copying and allow the originator to be financially rewarded.Patents give innovating firms a short-term monopoly on production to cover the costs of development and encourage investment.Biotech firms argue that such protection has provided incentives to produce Covid vaccines in record times.What is the debate?Many developing countries have argued that rules requiring countries to protect patents and other forms of intellectual property are an obstacle to increasing the production of vaccines and other products needed to tackle the pandemic.Calls for a vaccine patent waiver come as lower income countries face acute vaccine shortages.But opponents, particularly from the industry, have said it will not solve the problem.The head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, Thomas Cueni, told the BBC's Today programme he was \\\"deeply concerned\\\" that \\\"you could compromise the quality and safety of vaccines which we see now\\\".\\\"It is shortages and scarcity in the supply chains, which need to be addressed. And it is also right now the disappointing unwillingness of rich countries to early share doses with the poor countries,\\\" he said.Some experts say pharmaceutical companies would also need to share know-how, such as production techniques, with poorer countries to have any real beneficial effect.Nobody is protected until everyone's protected: on that world and business leaders are agreed.But pharmaceutical companies have called the decision by the US to back the sharing of secret recipes for vaccinations shortsighted, claiming it is understanding the production process that is the real challenge. It is, they say, akin to handing out a recipe without sharing the method or the ingredients, and could lead to quality issues and less efficient productionInstead, the UK and the EU have favoured a system of licensing, whereby knowhow is shared and there is more oversight. It is already being done on some cases on a voluntary basis - such as the tie up between Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute of India. And that licensing can be made compulsory, although the pharmaceutical companies could then be eligible for compensation.Some trade specialists have speculated that the US might be hoping that, by backing a lifting of patents, manufacturers might be more open to sharing expertise voluntarily - or at least, for a reduced charge.","postDate":"2021-05-06T19:46:34.000Z","title":"Covid: Germany rejects US-backed proposal to waive vaccine patents - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-57013096"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/145B7\/production\/_118238338_f9bec4c0-d46f-4646-8900-f9215aa7965d.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"Harrowing scenes from India show the extent of the crisis gripping the nation as the second wave of coronavirus brings the death toll to over 200,000.This article contains images some people may find upsetting.India has seen more Covid cases in the last seven days than any other country.People have died waiting for beds, as oxygen supplies run low and hospitals buckle under the strain.Now crematoriums are also running out of space, with some operating non-stop and workers saying they haven't had a break from performing last rites.In Hinduism, cremation is traditionally the most important part of the funeral rites because Hindus believe the body must be destroyed to force the soul to separate from it.In the Indian capital Delhi, workers have been forced to build makeshift funeral pyres, with parks and other empty spaces being utilised for cremations.Authorities have reportedly cut down trees in city parks to use as firewood.Families have had to wait hours before being allowed to cremate their dead and have also been asked to help with cremations by piling wood and assisting in other rituals.Here are pictures from Delhi showing workers and relatives taking part in cremations.All pictures are subject to copyright.","postDate":"2021-04-28T16:12:57.000Z","title":"India coronavirus: Round-the-clock mass cremations -

and some may even make the virus less dangerous - but others can make it more contagious and harder to vaccinate against.This variant - officially known as B.1.617 - was first detected in India in October.How far has it spread?Sample testing is not widespread enough across India to determine how far or quickly the variant is spreading.It was detected in 220 out of 361 Covid samples collected between January and March in the western Indian state of Maharashtra.Meanwhile, it has been spotted in at least 21 countries, according to the GISAID global database.International travel appears to have brought the variant to the UK, where 103 cases have been identified since 22 February.Most travellers from India have now been banned from coming to the UK.Public Health England has listed the India variant as one of several \\\"variants under investigation\\\".The BBC has been told by experts that it could soon be added to the \\\"variant of concern\\\" list.Is it more infectious or dangerous?Scientists do not yet know whether this variant is more infectious or resistant to vaccines.Dr Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University, says one of its mutations is similar to those seen in variants identified in South Africa and Brazil.And this mutation may help the virus evade antibodies in the immune system that can fight coronavirus based on experience from prior infection or a vaccine.But what appears to be more worrying at the moment is a variant identified in the UK, which is dominant in Britain and has spread to more than 50 countries.\\\"I doubt whether the Indian variant is more infectious than the UK variant - and we must not panic,\\\" Dr Kamil says.Why is so little known about it?Much of the data around the India variant is incomplete, scientists say, with very few samples being shared - 298 in India and 656 worldwide, compared with more than 384,000 sequences of the UK variant.And after the first recorded cases in India, fewer than 400 cases of the variant have been detected worldwide, Dr Kamil says.Is it driving the second wave in India?India has been reporting about 200,000 Covid cases daily since 15 April - well beyond its peak of 93,000 cases a day last year.Deaths too have been rising.\\\"India's high population and density is a perfect incubator for this virus to experiment with mutations,\\\" says Ravi Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge.However, the wave of cases in India could have been caused by large gatherings, and lack of preventive measures such as mask-wearing or social distancing.Dr Jeffrey Barrett, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, says it is possible there could also be a cause-and-effect relationship with the new variant, but there is still a lack of evidence.He points out that the India variant has been around since late last year: \\\"If it is driving the wave in India it has taken several months to get to this point which would suggest it's probably less transmissible than the Kent B117 variant.\\\"Will vaccines still work?Scientists believe existing vaccines will help control the variant when it comes to preventing severe disease.Some variants will inevitably escape the current vaccines, according to a paper published in Nature by Prof Gupta and his fellow researchers. As a result, changes to vaccine design will be needed to make them more effective.However, the vaccinations now available are still likely to slow down the spread of the disease.\\\"For most people, these vaccines can mean the difference between little to no disease and ending up in the hospital with a risk of dying,\\\" says Dr Kamil.\\\"Please take the first vaccine you are offered.

Many deaths in rural areas also go unregistered.Testing is increasing, but so too are the number of positive results.Last year, the World Health Organization recommended countries needed to get the positive test rate below 5% for at least two weeks before considering easing restrictions. The rate in India is now around 20%.A high percentage of positive tests suggests high infection rates and the likelihood of many more people in the community with coronavirus undetected, according to Johns Hopkins University.In total, India has confirmed more than 18 million infections and 200,000 deaths. Virologists say they expect the rate of infections to continue to increase for another two to three weeks.There are very few critical care bedsThe country has a chronic shortage of space on its intensive care wards, with many patients' families forced to drive for miles to try to find a bed for their loved one.In Delhi - a region of about 20 million people - hospitals are full and are turning away new patients.Doctors have described how people are dying on the streets outside hospitals as the country struggles to cope.Some streets outside medical facilities have become crowded with the seriously ill, their loved ones trying to arrange stretchers and oxygen supplies for them as they plead with hospital authorities for a place inside.\\\"We have been roaming around for three days searching for a bed,\\\" one man told Reuters news agency as his wife sat immobile on the pavement.On Monday, the government announced military medical infrastructure would be made available to civilians and retired medical military personnel would be helping out in Covid health facilities.There's a shortage of oxygenHospitals across India are also experiencing oxygen shortages, with some forced to put up signs warning of a lack of supplies.The country now has the greatest demand for oxygen out of all other low, lower-middle and upper-middle-income countries, according to the PATH Oxygen Needs Tracker.Demand has been growing between 6%-8% each day, according to PATH, an organisation that works with global institutions and businesses to tackle health problems.Dr Harjit Singh Bhatti, who works on a Covid ward of Delhi's Manipal Hospital, described watching people gasping for air in the street like \\\"fish out of water\\\".\\\"They are not getting oxygen and they are dying on the roads,\\\" he said.Typically, healthcare facilities consume about 15% of oxygen supply in India, leaving the rest for industrial use.But amid India's second wave, nearly 90% of the country's oxygen supply - 7,500 metric tonnes daily - is being diverted for medical use, according to Rajesh Bhushan, a senior health official.To try to get supplies to where they are needed, the government has now started an \\\"oxygen express\\\", with trains carrying tankers to wherever there is demand. The Indian Air Force is also airlifting oxygen from military bases.The government has said it will be releasing oxygen supplies from armed forces reserves and has approved plans for more than 500 oxygen generation plants across the country to boost supplies.Train carriages have become medical wardsIn a bid to tackle the shortage of beds, Indian authorities are turning to train carriages, which have been converted into isolation wards.About 4,000 Indian Railways coaches, adapted in March 2020, are being brought back into use to to help treat Covid patients with mild to moderate symptoms.The facilities, which were not needed last year when strict lockdown measures saw cases decline, were able to provide an additional 64,000 temporary beds, Gopal Agarwal, a spokesman for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, told the BBC.The trains, which can be driven to stations in cities and towns where required, have beds for patients, bathrooms, power points for medical equipment and oxygen supplies.Indian Railways already has experience of running hospitals on trains. The Lifeline Express, launched in 1991, travels round the country providing diagnostic, medical and surgical treatment to patients.Sports halls and stadiums have become hospitalsSports halls, stadiums and ashrams have also been converted into make-shift treatment centres to ease the pressure on hospitals.Venues like Bangalore's Koramangala Indoor Stadium, the Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium, in Guwahati, and Delhi's Radha Soami Satsang Beas campus have been converted into quarantine centres.Some of the beds being used are made from cardboard.During a surge in cases last year, the Delhi campus belonging to the Radha Soami Satsang Beas organisation was transformed into the 10,000-bed Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre, with 1,000 \\\"oxygen-supported\\\" beds. It treated more than 11,000 people before it closed in February.This time the centre - which is the size of 20 football fields - is expected to start with about 2,500 beds, increasing to 5,000.Aryan Paper, which makes the cardboard bed bases being used, says the emergency beds are made from high-strength corrugated board.They are particularly useful in the current crisis because they are cheap, recyclable, can be flatpacked for easy transportation and assembled in five minutes.Crematoriums are organising mass funeral pyresMany people are being forced to turn to makeshift facilities for mass burials and cremations as India's funeral services become overwhelmed.At least one facility in Delhi has resorted to building pyres in its car park in order to cope with the number of bodies.Other sites are holding mass cremations, with staff reportedly working day and night in several cities.Jitender Singh Shunty, head of a non-profit medical service running a crematorium in north-east Delhi, is using a car park next door to deal with the unprecedented number of bodies.\\\"It's difficult to watch,\\\" he said.A number of places have also reported running low on wood for pyres.Jayant Malhotra, who has been helping out at a crematorium in Delhi, told the BBC he had never seen such a terrifying situation.\\\"I can't believe we're in the capital of India.

But in previous months the rollout has been hit by delays in production and distribution and vaccine hesitancy in some countries.What's happening with the EU vaccine rollout?In June 2020, all 27 member states joined a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines.However, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca and there were supply problems.Its deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna also saw early problems with production and distribution.In February, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the EU's vaccine difficulties, saying: \\\"We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time.\\\"However, over the last few weeks, the daily number of doses has gone up considerably.In the week to 29 April, Hungary administered on average 1.2 doses per 100 people a day, the highest number in Europe.Germany administered 0.8 per 100 in the same week, the same number as the UK.France and the Netherlands have ramped up their vaccination programmes.Hungary also has one of the highest proportions of fully vaccinated people (who have received two doses) - 20% by 29 April.The UK has fully vaccinated 21% of its population and the EU as a whole 9%.Issues with AstraZenecaIn January, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups, but a number of EU countries initially refused to recommend its use for people over 65.France and Germany eventually revised their stance and approved the vaccine for people aged 65-74 at the beginning of March. But they were among 13 European countries who paused the AstraZeneca rollout again that month - following reports that a small number of people developed blood clots after receiving the jab.Most countries restarted it after the EMA said there was no evidence that the vaccine caused the clots.However, on 7 April the EMA said there was a \\\"possible link\\\" between the vaccine and the clots. The agency concluded that neither age nor gender were a clear risk factor and it is still recommending the jab for all age groups.Nevertheless, several EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands say only people over 55 or 60 should get the jab, while others like Denmark have suspended its use altogether.The headlines surrounding AstraZeneca have led to a drop in confidence in the jab across the EU. The polling company YouGov reports only a third of Germans and 23% of French respondents now consider it safe.The vaccine exports rowThe EU is concerned the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom have plants in the EU.On 20 April, the European Commission said the EU had exported 25 million doses to the UK so far, but said it was not aware of any vaccines going the other way.EU leaders considered a ban on exports of vaccines to the UK but decided not to introduce one.Instead, they called for more transparency from the UK and other countries on the number of doses they export and urged AstraZeneca to deliver what it promised.The EU says it has exported 113.5 million doses to 43 countries since 30 January.Can EU states make their own deals?Member states are allowed to strike separate deals with vaccine makers which have not signed agreements with the EU.Hungary and Slovakia have already bought doses of Russia's Sputnik vaccine, and the Czech Republic is said to be considering buying it too.Germany said in April it would begin talks to secure supplies of the Russian vaccine and Austria said it had concluded talks to buy one million doses.Under the terms of the EU scheme, member states are not supposed to strike deals with any vaccine manufacturer with whom the EU already has an agreement.However, the German government signed its own side-deal with Pfizer for 30 million extra doses in September.In January, the European Commission refused to say whether this had broken the terms of the EU scheme.Did the UK roll out vaccines quicker because of Brexit?The UK approved the Pfizer vaccine in November, nearly three weeks before EU regulators.The government claimed that being outside the EU allowed it to be more nimble in this area.However, the UK's approval of the jab would have been permitted anyway under EU law - a point made by the head of the UK medicines regulator.The UK could have joined the EU vaccine scheme last year while it was still in a transition phase with the EU, but it chose not to.If it had, the UK might not have been able to do as many deals with vaccine companies.","postDate":"2021-04-30T16:48:06.000Z","title":"Covid: What is happening with the EU vaccine rollout? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/explainers-52380823"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/1260C\/production\/_116867257_hi065587233.jpg","author":"Nick Triggle","description":"A number of countries have decided to suspend use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as a precaution following reports that some people have suffered blood clots after being given the jab.But is it a case of being too cautious? Are these nations missing the bigger picture?The decision has been made on the basis of the precautionary principle - a well-established approach in science and medicine that stresses the need to pause and review when evidence is uncertain.But in a fast-moving pandemic, when each decision can have major consequences, it is an approach which can sometimes do more harm than good.Cause or coincidence?The data supplied by AstraZeneca shows there have been 37 reports of blood clots among the 17m people across Europe who have been given the vaccine.But the key question that has to be asked is whether this is cause or coincidence? Would these clots have happened anyway?Adverse events like this are monitored carefully, so regulators can assess if they are happening more than they should.The 37 reports of clots are below the level you would expect. What is more, there is no strong biological explanation why the vaccine would cause a blood clot.It is why the World Health Organization and UK drugs regulators have all said there is no evidence of a link.Even the European Medicines Agency, which is looking into the reports, has suggested the vaccine should continue to be used in the meantime given the risk Covid presents to health.Unsurprisingly, therefore, the decisions by individual nations to pause their rollouts have baffled experts.Prof Adam Finn, a member of the WHO's working group on Covid vaccines, says stopping rollout in this way is \\\"highly undesirable\\\" and could undermine confidence in the vaccine, costing lives in the long-term.\\\"Making the right call in situations like this is not easy, but having a steady hand on the tiller is probably what is needed most.\\\"Has Europe got a problem with the vaccine?This is not the first time countries in Europe have exercised caution about the AstraZeneca vaccine.The precautionary principle was adopted by Germany, France and others when they did not initially recommend use of the vaccine for the over-65s. French President Emmanuel Macron even called it \\\"quasi-ineffective\\\".The over 65s decision has now been reversed, but the impact is still being felt it seems.Germany and France have supplies of the vaccine going to waste, with both countries having used fewer than half their supplies of the AstraZeneca jab so far. It has left them far more reliant on the Pfizer vaccine than the UK is.And this is threatening to have deadly consequences. France, Germany and the other major European nations all have higher rates of infection than the UK, and face the prospect of things getting worse before they get better.If you look back at the decision on the over-65s, you can see how it was made. The way the trials had been organised meant there was limited evidence on its use in older age groups.The organisers had wanted to recruit younger adults in the initial stages for safety reasons, so when it came to regulators assessing infection rates the data was not yet ready for older people.But there was evidence from blood samples that the vaccine had prompted a strong immune response in the older age groups. So there was no reason why the vaccine would not work in older age groups - it was just that insufficient time had passed to gather the evidence in the real world.There was also a problem interpreting results because of the way the trial was run. There was a lack of consistency across the different sites used.Protocols and practices followed varied across each, including the use of a half-dose in one.Some have described it as four trials within a trial. It created a somewhat messy set of data to interpret.Why bold decision-making may be bestThe UK looked past this and took the leap though - and within months was reporting \\\"spectacular\\\" results in reduced levels of serious illness in the over-80s.It was this pragmatic approach to decision-making that also led the UK to recommend up to a three-month gap between doses.This caused much controversy when it was announced at the end of December.The Pfizer vaccine was not tested like this in trials - the interval was three weeks.But again, the absence of evidence did not mean the move would not work or was not based on logic.The AstraZeneca trials did have longer intervals for some participants, which seemed to make it more effective, while evidence on the Moderna vaccine, which is a similar type of jab to Pfizer, also suggested it could work.It is also well-established that with two-dose vaccines, most of the protection is provided by the first dose, while the second boosts that and provides more long-lasting protection.With cases rising rapidly at the time, the UK was clear the benefit of maximising available vaccine supplies to provide some protection to more people was the right step even if the trial evidence did not directly support it.Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, an expert in understanding risk at Cambridge University, says it shows that sometimes you have to look beyond the precautionary principle and be bold in your decision-making.\\\"The precautionary principle favours inaction as a way of reducing risk. But the problem is that these are not normal times and inaction can be more risky than action.\\\"What is needed in circumstances like these, according to Sir David, is to work out what is most likely on the balance of probability. That requires looking at both the direct and indirect evidence and the context those decisions are being made in.\\\"Sometimes it can be harmful to wait for certainty. Not vaccinating people will costs lives.\\\"","postDate":"2021-03-15T15:01:03.000Z","title":"Is Europe's AstraZeneca jab decision-making flawed? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/health-56360646"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/31D8\/production\/_117506721_texa_leaguecity_afp_gettyimages-1230987777.jpg","author":"By Jake Horton","description":"A number of US states are lifting Covid restrictions, despite public health concerns about relaxing measures too soon.President Joe Biden has called moves to rapidly remove restrictions \\\"a big mistake\\\".So are some states in a good position to be lifting restrictions?What are the Covid rules?Individual US states are in charge of their own public health policy, and despite President Biden urging caution, some are lifting restrictions.The president has emphasised the use of face coverings and social distancing until the vaccine rollout can change the nature of the virus, saying he hopes the US will be \\\"closer to normal\\\" by July.More than 30 states still have a mask mandate in place, which generally requires people to wear a face covering inside private businesses and public buildings.But in January and February, several states removed their mask mandates, like North Dakota, Iowa and Montana.Most states have limits on the number of people who can enter businesses such as shops, bars and restaurants, but many of these limits are also being relaxed or removed altogether.In Texas, the state-wide mask mandate and social distancing requirements are no longer in place, and all businesses were able to open at 100% capacity from 10 March.Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves has also lifted that state's mask requirement, and has now allowed businesses to open at full capacity.Arizona and West Virginia have lifted capacity limits at restaurants and bars, but are keeping face coverings and social distancing requirements in place. Connecticut will do the same from 19 March.In Michigan, restaurants and bars are now allowed to operate at 50% capacity, up from 25%.Louisiana has done the same - allowing 75% capacity up from 50%.From 19 March, restaurants outside of New York City can operate at 75% capacity, up from 50%. Restaurants in New York City itself must continue to operate at 35%.What are the Covid rates?Governors have pointed to plummeting cases and hospital admissions in recent weeks as reasons for reopening.Across the US, Covid cases have been dropping since the middle of January, but they have begun to level off recently.In Texas and Mississippi, two states which have enacted the most rapid reopening, cases have even risen slightly in recent weeks, with health experts warning the rapid relaxation of restrictions risks a further rise in cases.Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, says: \\\"These states' lifting of measures like mask mandates are quite premature.\\\"\\\"Though the US case numbers have fallen considerably, our daily incidence is still dangerously high.\\\"Texas has recorded the second-highest number of cases and deaths across the US during the last week.New York was the only state to record more cases and California more deaths. Both of these states are maintaining restrictions, and mask wearing is enforced.Texas does have a bigger population than most states, but even in per capita terms it has one of the highest case rates - with about 143 confirmed cases per 100,000 people over the last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).Texas is recording about as many cases per day as the UK on average, despite having a population less than half the size.Mississippi has recorded fewer cases per capita than Texas and the majority of other states in the last week, with about 91 cases reported per 100,000 people.Hospital admissions have continued to fall in both states, but there tends to be a lag of a couple of weeks between infections and people entering hospital.There are hopes that fewer people who catch Covid will end up in hospital now vaccines are being rolled out, with the most vulnerable being protected.Does the vaccine rollout allow for reopening?The governors of Texas and Mississippi have highlighted their states' successful vaccine rollouts as a key factor in enabling them to fully reopen.But vaccination rates in these states are both below the national average, with only about 8% and 9% of their populations respectively being fully vaccinated (receiving two doses).Health experts warn this still leaves many people vulnerable to serious illness and death.Dr Vanessa Kerry, associate professor of medicine at Harvard University, said: \\\"We need to achieve a certain level of vaccination - 70% of the population - to adequately disrupt transmission and allow for a return toward normal.\\\"Kate Grabowksi, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University, said: \\\"Given that the Biden administration anticipates having enough vaccine for the entire US adult population by May, the lifting of restrictions feels like quitting the marathon at mile 25.\\\"The emergence of more contagious Covid variants is also a worry, with the CDC warning they pose a real threat to the country's progress.Dr Kerry added: \\\"This decision feels politically motivated and not public health driven.\\\"The Republican governors of both states made clear that the economy was a major consideration, insisting that with cases dropping and vaccines rolling out, it was time to restore livelihoods and reopen 100%.What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

But given it's also the flu season, how can you be sure whether you have coronavirus, a cold or the flu?They are all caused by different viruses, but can have similar symptoms.Most people who feel ill with coronavirus will have at least one of these three key symptoms:So what do you need to know about other things you may catch in the coming months?Does a fever mean I have coronavirus?A high temperature is 37.8C or above. A fever like this can happen when the body is fighting off any infection - not just coronavirus.It is best to use a thermometer to take a measure. But if you don't have one, check if you, or the person you are worried about, feels hot to the touch on the chest or back.Although fever is a key coronavirus symptom, it could be flu or a different infection.A high temperature is unlikely with a cold.If you have a fever, arrange a coronavirus test - you can use the NHS 111 coronavirus service online.What about a cough?If you have a cold or flu you may well have a cough, along with other symptoms.Flu usually comes on suddenly and sufferers will often experience muscle aches, chills, headaches, tiredness, a sore throat and a runny or stuffed nose, along with the cough. It feels worse than a heavy cold.Colds tend to develop more gradually and are less severe, although they do still make you feel unwell. Along with a cough, there may be sneezing and a sore throat and runny nose. Fever, chills, muscle aches and headaches are rare.A coronavirus cough means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing fits or \\\"episodes\\\" in 24 hours.If you usually have a cough because of a long-standing medical condition like COPD, it may be worse than usual.You should get tested for coronavirus if you develop a new, continuous cough.What do loss or change to smell or taste mean?These are key symptoms of coronavirus and mean you should get a test.It could still be that you have a simple cold. But you need to check, even if you don't feel unwell, to avoid the risk of spreading the virus.Does sneezing mean I've got coronavirus?Sneezing is not a symptom of coronavirus, and unless you also have a fever, cough or loss of smell and taste, you do not need a test.Sneeze droplets can spread infections though, so catch them in a tissue, put it in the bin and then wash your hands.Remember Hands. Face. Space to help stop the spread of coronavirus and other illnesses:More people in England are being offered a free flu jab this year too in the run-up to winter.How about a runny or blocked nose?A runny nose is not a reason to get tested for coronavirus, says NHS Scotland.Data from an app that has been monitoring Covid-19 symptoms, reported by UK users, suggests children present less often with respiratory symptoms and are more likely to be suffering from fever, headaches, fatigue and skin rashes.What if I am very unwell?People with coronavirus have a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe, although some will have none at all, but can still be infectious.Symptoms may appear up to two weeks after exposure to coronavirus, but usually around day five.Feeling breathless can be a sign of a more serious coronavirus infection.If you are having trouble breathing, contact your doctor online or over the phone, or the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.If you are very worried about sudden shortness of breath ring 999.And the NHS advises:","postDate":"2021-01-05T15:07:11.000Z","title":"Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/health-54145299"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/12A62\/production\/_115368367_vaccine2.jpg","author":"By James Gallagher","description":"Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world.More than one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in 178 countries worldwide.A range of different vaccines is being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying.Why do we need a vaccine?It is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet the vast majority of people are still vulnerable.The restrictions on our lives are the only thing holding the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread.Vaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are \\\"the\\\" exit strategy from the pandemic.The big three - Pfizer\\\/BioNtech, Moderna and Oxford\\\/AstraZenecaThe three vaccine frontrunners are those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca.Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design.They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence.These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US.The UK began the rollout of the Moderna jab in Wales on 7 April.The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe.It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures.All three are supposed to be given as two doses, but the UK is prioritising giving as many people as possible the first dose and delaying the second.Janssen and NovavaxResults from large-scale trials on two new vaccines have also been presented recently.The work by Janssen, which is owned by Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax will now be reviewed by drugs regulators before their jabs can be approved.Janssen's vaccine uses the same technique as Oxford, but crucially is given as a single injection, rather than two. This, combined with it needing only a fridge to store and a billion doses planned this year, means it could make a significant impact around the world.Novavax is using a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body.What is the rest of the world doing?There are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US.The Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection.The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according to late stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised.The vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death.Are they all equally effective?It is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic.However, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid.Nonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown.Understanding which method produces the best results will be explored in challenge trials where people are deliberately infected with the virus.What about variants?New versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world.However, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first \\\"real-world\\\" data on the new variants.Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading.The results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target.We may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.What still needs to be done?Follow James on TwitterWhat do I need to know about the coronavirus?","postDate":"2021-04-28T10:03:27.000Z","title":"Covid vaccine update: Those that work - and the others on the way - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/health-51665497"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/73D6\/production\/_116545692_gettyimages-1230608718-1.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"A sanitation worker became the first Indian to receive a Covid vaccine as the country began the world's largest inoculation drive.Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the programme, which aims to vaccinate more than 1.3 billion people against Covid.He paid tribute to front-line workers who will be the first to receive jabs.India has recorded the second-highest number of Covid-19 infections in the world after the United States.Millions of doses of two approved vaccines - Covishield and Covaxin - were shipped across the country in the days leading up to the start of the drive.\\\"We are launching the world's biggest vaccination drive and it shows the world our capability,\\\" Mr Modi, said, addressing the country on Saturday morning.He added that India was well prepared to vaccinate its population with the help of an app, which would help the government track the drive and ensure that nobody was left out.Mr Modi spoke at length about doctors, nurses and other front-line workers \\\"who showed us the light\\\" in \\\"dark times\\\".\\\"They stayed away from their families to serve humanity. And hundreds of them never went home. They gave their life to save others. And that is why the first jabs are being given to healthcare workers - this is our way of paying respect to them.\\\"At the sceneGeeta Pandey, BBC News, DelhiDoctors and medical staff at Delhi's Max hospital tell me a lot of hope is being pinned on the vaccination drive. One official described it \\\"as a new dawn\\\" and said \\\"it's the beginning of Covid's end\\\".Inside the waiting room, there are posters on the wall with information about the documents one needs to bring, how safe the vaccine is, and the precautions that need to be taken even after one's been vaccinated. Among those being vaccinated on Saturday are doctors, nurses and front-office staff from all departments.The names have been been chosen alphabetically so those getting jabs are mostly those with names starting with the letter A.\\\"The pandemic has played havoc in the country. I hope the vaccine will rid us of the fears and we will be able to breathe easy,\\\" Dr Anil Dass said after getting the jab.Ashutosh Chaturvedi, a 31-year-old male nurse described as a \\\"Covid warrior\\\" by hospital officials, became the first recipient of the vaccine at Max.\\\"I'm fine, I feel good,\\\" he told reporters as he came down the hospital ramp, which has been decorated with blue, green and white balloons.Since April, he told me, he's worked in the emergency wing of the Covid ward, tending to those afflicted with the coronavirus.\\\"I haven't seen my wife and nine-month-old daughter since then. A month later, once I've received the second dose, I'll visit my family,\\\" he said.Mr Modi also appealed to people to continue adhering to Covid-19 safety protocols like wearing masks and following social distancing. He said the country cannot afford to be complacent as vaccinating the entire population will take time.He also urged people not to believe any \\\"propaganda and rumours about the safety of the vaccines\\\".\\\"I want to tell people that the approval to these vaccines was given only after scientists and experts were satisfied about its safety,\\\" he said.An estimated 10 million health workers will be vaccinated in the first round, followed by policemen, soldiers, municipal and other front-line workers.Next in line will be people aged over 50 and anyone under 50 with serious underlying health conditions. India's electoral rolls, which contain details of some 900 million voters, will be used to identify eligible recipients.The government plans to vaccinate 300 million people by early August. This will happen in state-run health care centres, schools, colleges, community halls, municipal offices and wedding halls.Several hospitals across India are giving the first doses of the vaccine.Dr Atul Peters was among those who got the jab at Max hospital.\\\"It's a very big day. I'm grateful to those who worked hard to make this a reality. I was very very happy when I got a call informing me that my name was on the list.\\\"We worked hard during the pandemic to save lives and we are also taking the jab first to dispel fears in people's minds that the vaccine is not safe,\\\" he told the BBC.India's drug regulator has given the green light to two vaccines - Covishield (the local name for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine developed in the UK) and Covaxin, locally-made by pharma company Bharat Biotech.But concerns have been raised over the efficacy of Covaxin because the regulator's emergency approval came before the completion of Phase 3 clinical trials. The regulator and the manufacturer have said the vaccine is safe, and that the efficacy data would be available by February.Both vaccines will be given as two injections, 28 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity would begin to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect 14 days after the second dose.The status of the vaccines and recipients will be electronically tracked in real time - some 8 million people who will receive the early jabs have been already registered. More than 600,000 people have been trained for the drive.The jabs will be voluntary, and recipients will be given a certificate of vaccination after they complete both doses.\\\"I expect India's vaccination programme will be run much better than most countries because of the considerable government investment and early preparedness,\\\" Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India's best-known vaccine experts, told the BBC.With more than 10 million cases, India has recorded the second-highest number of Covid-19 infections in the world, after the US.The largest vaccination drive in the country, however, begins at a time when infections have fallen sharply, and much of life has returned to normal. A limited availability of doses in the initial phase, therefore, is not likely to pose a problem.Most scientists feel India is primed for the challenge as it is a vaccine-making powerhouse and has run, for decades, a well-oiled immunisation programme for tens of millions of new-borns and mothers-to-be.But the real challenges will begin when the general population starts receiving the jabs.India will use its formidable election machinery to deliver and track doses to recipients in far corners of the country. It is also likely to use digital platforms and apps to enable people to register for the doses.However, not every Indian owns a smart phone or knows how to operate an app, so it will be interesting to see what the government does to make sure that there are no inadvertent exclusions.Vaccine hesitancy is the other concern.The recent controversy over the hurried approval of Covaxin, many feel, could undermine confidence. There's a history of hesitancy about receiving the polio vaccine in parts of northern India, triggered by rumours about vaccines being impure and affecting fertility. Similar disinformation is now circulating about Covid vaccines on social networking apps, such as WhatsApp.The government will need consistent, clear-eyed communication to bolster vaccine acceptance and community perception of the programme.Vaccines come with side effects for some people. India has a 34-year-old surveillance programme for monitoring such \\\"adverse events\\\" following immunisation.But researchers have found that benchmarks for reporting side effects still remain weak. A failure to transparently report adverse effects could easily lead to fear-mongering around vaccines.","postDate":"2021-01-16T07:39:45.000Z","title":"Coronavirus vaccine: India begins world's biggest drive - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-india-55632782"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/BC10\/production\/_116544184_gettyimages-1230050273.jpg","author":"By Regan Morris and Sophie Long","description":"California was praised for acting swiftly to contain the coronavirus last spring. Now more than 31,000 people have died of the virus in the state. What went wrong?California was the first to issue a state-wide stay-at-home order, and experts at the time predicted the pandemic would peak here in April with fewer than 2,000 lives lost.But since November, deaths have surged by more than 1,000%. In Los Angeles alone, nearly 2,000 people died this week.Makeshift morgues have been set up across the state, ICUs are full, oxygen is being rationed and ambulance teams have been told not to transport those unlikely to survive the night because hospitals are too full.Disneyland, which has been closed since March, is now being turned into a massive vaccination centre, along with Dodger Stadium, in the hopes of controlling what's become a super surge.Why is California in such dire Covid straits?\\\"Fatigue,\\\" says Dr Neha Nanda, of the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine. \\\"It's multifaceted, but fatigue is a big reason why.\\\"Southern California and Los Angeles are the hardest hit regions in California and the United States right now.Local and state officials begged Californians to not make holiday plans from Thanksgiving through to New Year. But even strict mandates here often go unenforced.Many businesses have collapsed, the film industry is mostly dormant. Productions that do get the green light are often forced to shut down again due to coronavirus outbreaks on set.And most schools in California have been closed since 13 March, with children isolated at home on computers, often with their parents away at work or trying to work alongside their children on overstretched Wi-Fi.And like most places, Covid-19 has hit Los Angeles' poor the hardest.Dr Heidi Behforouz, the medical director of LA County's Housing for Health, says she thinks Los Angeles is a city accustomed to tolerating extreme inequities in a country that does the same.\\\"We're sort of a pull yourself up by your bootstraps kind of country - we're very individually minded and it's hard for us to think about giving up what we feel is our right to do what we want,\\\" she says.While Covid-19 can infect anyone, it's definitely more cruel to the have-nots than the haves.For every case of Covid in Beverly Hills, there are six times more in Compton. While two people from Bel Air have died, more than 230 people have lost their lives in working-class East LA.And now, the virus is surging through LA's vast homeless population. People who live in Los Angeles are used to driving past dozens, hundreds or even thousands of people living on the streets every day.At the beginning of the pandemic, they were largely spared from infection - likely because they're so isolated as a population.Cities and counties are using trailers and motels to house Covid positive people without shelter.The Union Rescue Mission on LA's Skid Row is normally buzzing with lively dinner guests and residents. But in these pandemic days it's quiet, with most of its residents isolated in quarantine.Behind the building, a fabric tent meant to house the most vulnerable women on the streets is now a field hospital full of men with Covid, tended to by doctors and nurses covered head-to-toe in the now familiar protective gear.\\\"The Covid situation is the worst ever and this is the most horrific battle we've ever been in,\\\" says Reverend Andy Bales, who runs the mission.\\\"It's like playing chess with a monster genius - every move we make, it gets overcome by Covid.\\\"At the beginning of the pandemic in March, Mr Bales was relieved that the homeless population seemed spared from the coronavirus.But then in April, a beloved staff member at the mission, Gerald Shiroma, died of the virus. He was 56.Mr Shiroma had overcome a meth addiction and a life on the streets to become a sober and was a beloved driver at the mission.\\\"He was a wonderful guy,\\\" Mr Bales says. \\\"Everyone here loved him.\\\"As exhausted frontline medical workers continue their fight, the fear is that things will continue to get worse.As the virus spreads, it's likely mutating more than we know, says Dr Neha Nanda.\\\"Maybe the bigger the place, the more variation,\\\" she says.","postDate":"2021-01-15T22:54:48.000Z","title":"Covid in California: The state is struggling to contain the virus - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/election-us-2020-55578098"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/FB02\/production\/_112985246_us_corona_promo.png","author":"Unknown","description":"The news of President Donald Trump's positive coronavirus test, and his subsequent hospitalisation, has reminded the country that no-one is protected from this virus.So where is the US right now in dealing with the pandemic?What's the overall picture?With about 7.5 million coronavirus cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world - about one fifth of the global total despite having only 4% of the population.After the initial spike in late March, social distancing restrictions gradually brought infections to heel. By May, case numbers had stabilised. But as states peeled back lockdown measures, cases began to rise, reaching a countrywide high in July.But as summer hotspots - like Arizona, Florida and California - brought their outbreaks under control, surges have developed elsewhere, with fast-moving outbreaks in North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.In recent weeks, infections have risen steadily, with national cases increasing for three weeks in a row. Though numbers have so far not reached the record-breaking levels of July and August, the country is reporting more than 40,000 new cases each day.Hospitalisations, too, are on the rise. According to data compiled by the Covid Tracking Project, the average number of people hospitalised for coronavirus in a week rose recently for the first time since July.Why are cases rising?It's difficult to explain precisely why.One contributing factor has been the return to school for US students.A recent study from the US Centers for Disease Control on the almost 100,000 coronavirus cases reported between 2 August and 5 September - around when college students began their return to school - found that weekly cases among those aged 18-22 increased by 55% nationally.The greatest increases came from the Northeast (which includes New York, Connecticut and New Jersey) and the Midwest, which is a region located west of the Northeast, including Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin.There have now been more than 130,000 cases identified at more than 1,300 American colleges, according to reporting from the New York Times.Another compounding factor is the change in seasons. Top US virus expert Dr Anthony Fauci said last month that we should plan to \\\"hunker down\\\" through the autumn and winter. \\\"It's not going to be easy,\\\" he said.Why? A key piece of coronavirus health advice has been to do things outside. This gets more difficult as temperatures slip. Instead, cold weather will drive people indoors to closer quarters with potentially poor ventilation, where the risk of spread is heightened.What's more, viruses tend to survive more easily in cold conditions.There are now additional fears that the virus will collide with the US influenza season - which typically begins in October - threatening to overwhelm the health system.Are deaths still falling?Here's some good news - virus deaths in the US are continuing to fall, albeit gradually.As of early October, the daily average had reached around 720, a marked drop from the staggering 1,000-plus daily fatalities recorded this summer.But the bad news? This decline appears to have slowed in recent weeks. And recent daily tallies suggest some ground has been lost since the record lows of early July.In total, over 210,000 people have died of Covid-19 across the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.What are the hotspots?Case numbers remain high throughout much of the country, with concentrations in the Upper Midwest (that includes Wisconsin and Minnesota) and parts of the West.Wisconsin is one of the hardest-hit states. Case numbers there have quadrupled in the past month, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Hospitalisations more than doubled throughout the month of September, and the test positivity rate is now at a weekly average of 19.6%,To put this figure into perspective: the World Health Organization (WHO) in May suggested a positive case rate at or below 5%, for two weeks, before reopening measures were implemented.North Dakota is also in the throes of a major outbreak. For the fourth week in a row, it led the US in most cases per capita - at 548 cases per one million residents. Neighbouring South Dakota, as well as Montana, Utah and Idaho are also recording severe upticks in new infections.Sunbelt states Arizona, Florida and California - pummelled by the virus this summer - are now getting some relief, with steep declines.Is New York City shutting down again?New York City, once the epicentre of the US outbreak, is once again facing climbing case numbers. In late September, as many public schools began their reopening, Mayor Bill de Blasio reported a daily positive test rate of 3.25% - the highest daily rate since June.Amid mounting fears of a second wave, Mr de Blasio announced plans to close nonessential businesses in nine hotspots in Brooklyn and Queens - a plan quickly refused by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a fellow Democrat and political rival.Mr Cuomo said there \\\"could be\\\" a future rollback of indoor and outdoor dining in hotspot areas, but described the closure of nonessential businesses in certain postal codes as \\\"arbitrary and capricious\\\".But despite the political tug-of-war, the city will go ahead with plans to shutter public and private school in those nine areas, home to about 500,000 New Yorkers, including large communities of Orthodox Jews, among whom the virus has been spreading rapidly.\\\"I'm not going to recommend or allow any New York City family to send their child to a school that I wouldn't send my child,\\\" Mr Cuomo said of the closures.It's interesting that these considerations are playing out in New York City even though it still has a lower positivity rate than many other parts of the country..","postDate":"2020-10-08T21:15:33.000Z","title":"Coronavirus: Why are infections rising again in US? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/election-us-2020-54423928"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/11DDF\/production\/_117638137_rome.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"Europe's vaccination campaign has picked up pace and the number of infections is starting to fall.Countries are now looking for ways to lift coronavirus restrictions safely, ahead of summer and the tourist season.FranceFrance is starting to ease itself out of the lockdown.From 3 May, traveling further than 10km from home will be permitted again.Shops, café terraces and cultural venues are expected to start opening their doors again from mid-May.Secondary school students are expected to go back in early May and nurseries and primary schools have already reopened.From 19 May, the night-time curfew will start two hours later at 21:00, and eventually be lifted at the end of June.GermanyA controversial new lockdown law enables Germany's federal government to impose an overnight curfew and shut schools wherever infection rates rise too high.Cities or areas that exceed a rate of 100 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants for three consecutive days have to impose the measures.Large parts of Germany already exceed the limit, including cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Frankfurt and Munich as well as many rural areas.The law will remain in place until 30 June.ItalyMost of Italy is now in a \\\"yellow zone\\\" which means that bars and restaurants can reopen.Most students are back at school, and some outdoor cultural events are allowed.A curfew between 22:00 and 05:00 remains in place nationwide and masks are compulsory in all public spaces, indoors and outdoors.DenmarkDenmark has lifted a number of restrictions already - shops are open, outdoor eating is allowed and indoor dining will resume in early May.The government has also introduced a \\\"corona pass\\\" for everyone over the age of 15.This pass, available on mobile phone or on paper, shows whether people have been vaccinated, previously infected or have had a negative test in the past 72 hours.People need to show it for entry to bars, restaurants, museums or hairdressers, or to attend football matches.GreeceFrom 15 May, the government will allow any tourist to visit the country, if they have been vaccinated or can provide a negative coronavirus test.However, restrictions are still in place for the Orthodox Easter on 2 May - travelling to another prefecture is not allowed and a curfew is in place.From 3 May restaurants will be allowed to seat people outside.Schools will reopen on 10 May.PolandFrom 4 May shopping centres and hotels will be allowed to reopen with reduced customer numbers.All primary school children will be able to return to school.Hairdressers will also be able to reopen.The Czech RepublicThe government has approved the return of the upper level of primary school from 3 May, on a week-on, week-off basis, but only in regions with favourable numbers.All shops are due to open from 10 May and outside table service in pubs and restaurants will resume from 17 May.SpainThe government says Spain will welcome tourists from June, following a pilot trial of digital health certificates at its airports in May.Tourism Minister Fernando Valdes said that Spain \\\"will be ready\\\" to use a Covid passport by June.Some regions of Spain have started lifting restrictions. Catalonia now allows movement between zones, and in Valencia, restrictions on numbers of people allowed into bars and restaurants are being further eased.BelgiumSome lockdown measures have already been eased.

It was identified in a sample taken from a traveller from India in late March.The WHO says preliminary analysis shows this variant has had a \\\"higher growth rate than other circulating variants in India, suggesting potential increased transmissibility.\\\"A new variant of the virus emerged in South Africa last year, and contributed to record case numbers in the southern African region, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).Elsewhere in Africa, this variant had been recorded in Angola, Botswana, Cameroon, Comoros, DR Congo, eSwatini, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Libya, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.Over the past week, four more countries - Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Madagascar and Togo - have confirmed presence of the variant.It's highly likely to have reached other countries on the continent, but few have the capacity to carry out the specialised genomic sequencing required to detect coronavirus variants.In Nigeria, scientists have also identified a new variant of the virus, although there is currently no evidence to indicate it is contributing to increased transmission.The variant was identified in a sample collected in late November from a patient in Lagos state, and has been detected in four other states in the country.Twenty countries have also reported presence of a Covid-19 variant first identified in the UK.The WHO and the African Centres for Disease Control launched a network of laboratories last year to try to boost the continent's capacity to identify these variants.It said the emergence of new, and more contagious variants \\\"reinforced the need to step up genomic surveillance.\\\"This involves analysing the code of the virus to understand its genetic makeup.However, a recent article in The Lancet pointed out that while efforts were underway to expand this type of work, there were issues around funding, as well as shortages of reagents and staff with the skills required.What's happening to case numbers?Over the past month, new cases across the continent declined by 0.3%, according to the CDC.However, the number of deaths rose by 3%.New cases have been rising in north and east Africa (in countries like Kenya, Ethiopia, Egypt,Libya and Tunisia), but dropping in south and west Africa.The rate has remained largely the same in central Africa.\\\"Africa is not out of the woods yet, and complacency is not an option at this time,\\\" says the head of immunisation at the WHO Africa office, Richard Mihigo.Most countries have launched Covid-19 immunisation campaigns, but there are still a few countries yet to roll out or even acquire vaccines.And many countries have concentrated on priority groups such as healthcare workers in the initial vaccination phase.Death rates have been risingDuring the first stage of the pandemic, Africa's overall fatality rate - the proportion of those with Covid who then die - was lower than elsewhere in the world.There were a number of theories put forward as to why that might be the case, such as the relatively younger population, and possible cross-immunity from other coronaviruses.But the Africa CDC has now warned about rising fatality rates in the continent, saying that of the 55 countries they monitor, 21 are now reporting fatality rates above the current global average of 2.2%.The fatality rate for Africa has crept up since July last year when it was on average 2.1% - to 2.7% in April this year (measured over the duration of the pandemic).The global fatality rate has fallen since the start of the pandemic, which in itself would put more African countries above the global average.And fatality rates are also affected by how much testing is done - a country with low levels of testing will show a higher death rate because many non-fatal Covid cases are going undetected.More importantly, data for deaths should be treated with caution, given the wide variations in how countries record them.In South Africa, research into excess deaths - that's the number of deaths in a certain period above what would normally be expected - shows that there were 153,668 more deaths between 6 May last year and 10 April this year.The official death toll from Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic is just above 53,000.And South Africa was just one of eight countries on the continent that the BBC found in a recent investigation had adequate death registration systems.So coronavirus deaths across Africa as a whole are likely to be under-recorded.There are wide variations in testing rates and while some countries have reduced testing, others have maintained or even increased it at different points during the pandemic.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questions","postDate":"2021-04-30T16:02:24.000Z","title":"Coronavirus: New variants are causing growing concern in Africa -

regarded as the gold standard of testing - very widely.But currently, only 60% of all tests use this method, and many Indian states - who are in charge of their own health policies - have switched to rapid antigen testing (RAT), a faster but less reliable method.RAT tests are known to miss up to 50% of cases due to false negatives (where infected people are not detected), although some experts believe they are still useful in areas which have become virus hotspots.\\\"The ability to detect cases depends on a relative mix of the less sensitive RAT test and the gold standard PCR test,\\\" says Prof Gautam Menon, an infectious disease expert from Ashoka University in Haryana.India isn't alone in using these tests, and some European countries grappling with further waves of infection have also resorted to rapid testing.Is testing consistent across the country?No, it's not.Maharashtra is the worst-affected state in India, with 17% of all cases.In terms of total coronavirus cases, it's followed by states with smaller populations such as Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.But Uttar Pradesh and Bihar - two other states with large populations - appear to be doing much better.They have lower proportions of confirmed cases at 2.9% and 1.6%.What the testing data reveals is that in both Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (and some other states) less than 50% of total tests use the PCR method - so cases are being missed.In Maharashtra, nearly 60% of tests have been PCR tests (although they are increasingly using rapid testing in the state capital, Mumbai.)And Tamil Nadu state has relied totally on PCR testing, which means it is likely to have a far more accurate idea of the spread of the virus.Patchy testing levels across statesThere's evidence that states may also not be testing enough in highly populated areas where infections tend to be higher.As of 30 November, 13% of Uttar Pradesh's cases were found in its capital, Lucknow, although fewer than 6% of total tests in the state have been carried out there.Kanpur district has the second-highest number of cases in the state, but just under 3% of total tests have been conducted there.District-level data in Bihar reveals a similar trend. One of the most populous areas, Patna, accounts for 18% of all reported cases yet has conducted only 3% of the total tests in the state.Other parts of the state have carried out relatively high numbers of tests, but have fewer cases.\\\"If you do fewer tests in areas where cases are high and vice-versa [more tests where cases are low], you end up reporting less cases while meeting a specific high-testing target,\\\" says Dr Rijo John, a public health policy analyst in Kerala.He adds this can make the data on case numbers a bit meaningless.Varying surveillance systemsIndia's Covid-19 national guidelines say states should trace contacts of at least 80% of positive cases within 72 hours.But India's parliamentary committee on health and family welfare has said that \\\"poor contact tracing and less testing could have been a factor for the exponential growth of Covid\\\".It's difficult to get reliable information from every state about contact tracing.Uttar Pradesh was recently lauded by the WHO for \\\"early and systemic tracking of high-risk contacts\\\".By contrast, data for Karnataka shows its numbers for primary and secondary contact tracing have fallen since September.Telangana state has data for the proportion of tests carried out on the primary and secondary contacts of those who have contracted Covid-19.This has come down a bit since September along with overall testing numbers.In Kerala, the data shows 95% of all cases since 4 May have been traced back to the primary and secondary contacts of infected persons.But none of these datasets reveals if 80% of contacts of someone who was positive were traced within the timeframe set out in the national guidelines.And many states do not make this data public.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter","postDate":"2020-12-04T00:08:14.000Z","title":"Coronavirus: Is India's test and tracing strategy working? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-india-55083825"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/15A98\/production\/_115482788_redsyringemicrochip.jpg","author":"By Flora Carmichael and Jack Goodman","description":"We've looked into some of the most widely shared false vaccine claims - everything from alleged plots to put microchips into people to the supposed re-engineering of our genetic code.'Altered DNA' claimsThe fear that a vaccine will somehow change your DNA is one we've seen aired regularly on social media.The BBC asked three independent scientists about this. They said that the coronavirus vaccine would not alter human DNA.Some of the newly created vaccines, including the one now approved in the UK developed by Pfizer\\\/BioNTech, use a fragment of the virus's genetic material - or messenger RNA.\\\"Injecting RNA into a person doesn't do anything to the DNA of a human cell,\\\" says Prof Jeffrey Almond of Oxford University.It works by giving the body instructions to produce a protein which is present on the surface of the coronavirus.The immune system then learns to recognise and produce antibodies against the protein.This isn't the first time we've looked into claims that a coronavirus vaccine will supposedly alter DNA. We investigated a popular video spreading the theory back in May.Posts have noted that messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology \\\"has never been tested or approved before\\\".It is true that no mRNA vaccine has been approved before now, but multiple studies of mRNA vaccines in humans have taken place over the last few years. And, since the pandemic started, the vaccine has been tested on tens of thousands of people around the world and has gone through a rigorous safety approval process.Like all new vaccines, it has to undergo rigorous safety checks before it can be recommended for widespread use.In Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, vaccines are tested in small numbers of volunteers to check they are safe and to determine the right dose.In Phase 3 trials they are tested in thousands of people to see how effective they are. The group who received the vaccine and a control group who have received a placebo are closely monitored for any adverse reactions - side-effects. Safety monitoring continues after a vaccine has been approved for use.Bill Gates and microchip claimsNext, a conspiracy theory that has spanned the globe.It claims that the coronavirus pandemic is a cover for a plan to implant trackable microchips and that the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is behind it.There is no vaccine \\\"microchip\\\" and there is no evidence to support claims that Bill Gates is planning for this in the future.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told the BBC the claim was \\\"false\\\".Rumours took hold in March when Mr Gates said in an interview that eventually \\\"we will have some digital certificates\\\" which would be used to show who'd recovered, been tested and ultimately who received a vaccine. He made no mention of microchips.This led to one widely shared article headlined: \\\"Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus.\\\"The article makes reference to a study, funded by The Gates Foundation, into a technology that could store someone's vaccine records in a special ink administered at the same time as an injection.However, the technology is not a microchip and is more like an invisible tattoo. It has not been rolled out yet, would not allow people to be tracked and personal information would not be entered into a database, says Ana Jaklenec, a scientist involved in the study.The billionaire founder of Microsoft has been the subject of many false rumours during the pandemic.He's been targeted because of his philanthropic work in public health and vaccine development.Despite the lack of evidence, in May a YouGov poll of 1,640 people suggested 28% of Americans believed Mr Gates wanted to use vaccines to implant microchips in people - with the figure rising to 44% among Republicans.Fetus tissue claimsWe've seen claims that vaccines contain the lung tissue of an aborted fetus. This is false.\\\"There are no fetal cells used in any vaccine production process,\\\" says Dr Michael Head, of the University of Southampton.One particular video that was posted on one of the biggest anti-vaccine Facebook pages refers to a study which the narrator claims is evidence of what goes into the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. But the narrator's interpretation is wrong - the study in question explored how the vaccine reacted when introduced to human cells in a lab.Confusion may have arisen because there is a step in the process of developing a vaccine that uses cells grown in a lab, which are the descendants of embryonic cells that would otherwise have been destroyed. The technique was developed in the 1960s, and no fetuses were aborted for the purposes of this research.Many vaccines are made in this way, explains Dr David Matthews, from Bristol University, adding that any traces of the cells are comprehensively removed from the vaccine \\\"to exceptionally high standards\\\".The developers of the vaccine at Oxford University say they worked with cloned cells, but these cells \\\"are not themselves the cells of aborted babies\\\".The cells work like a factory to manufacture a greatly weakened form of the virus that has been adapted to function as a vaccine.But even though the weakened virus is created using these cloned cells, this cellular material is removed when the virus is purified and not used in the vaccine.Recovery rate claimsWe've seen arguments against a Covid-19 vaccine shared across social media asking why we need one at all if the chances of dying from the virus are so slim.A meme shared by people who oppose vaccination put the recovery rate from the disease at 99.97% and suggested getting Covid-19 is a safer option than taking a vaccine.To begin with, the figure referred to in the meme as the \\\"recovery rate\\\" - implying these are people who caught the virus and survived - is not correct.About 99.0% of people who catch Covid survive it, says Jason Oke, senior statistician at the University of Oxford.So around 100 in 10,000 will die - far higher than three in 10,000, as suggested in the meme.However, Mr Oke adds that \\\"in all cases the risks very much depend on age and do not take into account short and long-term morbidity from Covid-19\\\".It's not just about survival. For every person who dies, there are others who live through it but undergo intensive medical care, and those who suffer long-lasting health effects.This can contribute to a health service overburdened with Covid patients, competing with a hospital's limited resources to treat patients with other illnesses and injuries.Concentrating on the overall death rate, or breaking down the taking of a vaccine to an individual act, misses the point of vaccinations, says Prof Liam Smeeth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It should be seen as an effort by society to protect others, he says.\\\"In the UK, the worst part of the pandemic, the reason for lockdown, is because the health service would be overwhelmed. Vulnerable groups like the old and sick in care homes have a much higher chance of getting severely ill if they catch the virus\\\".Additional reporting by Kris Bramwell, Olga Robinson and Marianna SpringRead more from Reality CheckSend us your questions","postDate":"2020-12-02T11:58:53.000Z","title":"Vaccine rumours debunked: Microchips, 'altered DNA' and more - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/54893437"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/141FC\/production\/_115682428_vaccine-memes_graphic_v2.jpg","author":"By Jack Goodman and Flora Carmichael","description":"Memes, often in the form of humorous images and videos, are a major part of how people communicate on the internet, but they can also be used to spread disinformation.We've been looking at how these memes can present false and misleading information about Covid-19 vaccines, feeding into concerns about their efficacy or safety.Misusing a music video to spread falsehoodsA popular meme - including images from rapper Drake's Hotline Bling music video - popped up in a number of local and community online forums in the UK and US this week - spreading false claims that a vaccine will modify our genetic code (DNA).It also says the recovery rate from the disease is 99.97% - suggesting getting the disease is a safer option than a vaccine.We've seen similar arguments against a Covid-19 vaccine shared across social media - asking why we need one at all if the chances of dying from the virus are so slim.To begin with, the figure referred to in the meme as the \\\"recovery rate\\\" - implying these are people who caught the virus - is not correct.About 99.0% of people who catch Covid survive it, says Jason Oke, Senior Statistician at the University of Oxford.So around 100 in 10,000 will die - far higher than three in 10,000, as suggested in the meme.However, Mr Oke adds that \\\"in all cases the risks very much depend on age and do not take into account short and long-term morbidity from Covid-19\\\" .Without a vaccine, there will be many more infections - and therefore deaths - before enough people are immune to stop the spread. This is known as herd immunity - when a certain portion of the population have caught the virus.It's not just about survival. For every person who dies, there are others who live through it but undergo intensive medical care, and those who suffer long-lasting health effects.This can contribute to a health service overburdened with Covid patients, competing with a hospital's limited resources to treat patients with other illnesses and injuries.Concentrating on the overall death rate, or breaking down the taking of a vaccine to an individual act, misses the point of vaccinations, says Prof Liam Smeeth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Vulnerable groups like the old and sick in care homes have a much higher chance of getting severely ill if they catch the virus\\\".Satire or disinformation?While mainly associated with humour, memes can also carry negative messages on emotive subjects.Some of the most common memes about vaccines make it appear that a vaccine can have some radical side effects.Images of disfigured people or creatures are shared alongside claims that they show the \\\"first person to receive the vaccine\\\" or captions saying that the jab \\\"didn't even hurt\\\".It might seem obvious these images are not meant to be taken literally, but they are often shared in groups which are strongly opposed to vaccinations.It's true that vaccines can have side effects, but these are mostly mild such as a sore arm, headache or a raised temperature for a day or two.Vaccines go through rigorous safety checks before they can be administered to the public, with side effects closely monitored.When memes have been appearing on social media feeds for months, some people start questioning if there's anything to these false or baseless claims.\\\"Memes like these can be disarming, because they tap into fears we all have about trust in science and medication side effects\\\" says Joan Donovan, a lecturer at Harvard University, and an expert on disinformation.\\\"Tying together negative messaging to pop culture can be especially memorable and drive people to share because the meme is funny, outrageous, or sticky (memorable).\\\"Another widely shared group of memes links falsehoods about vaccines to freedom and individual liberties.One we've seen uses images of someone applying clown make-up, suggesting requirements for wearing a mask will be followed by an \\\"experimental vaccine\\\" and then an \\\"implantable microchip\\\".Other posts seek to downplay the risks of coronavirus and suggest there is an ulterior motive behind the development of a vaccine.Vaccines must meet a high standard of safety and effectiveness before they are approved for use - it's misleading to call them experimental.As for the microchip rumour, we've debunked that before.Another example suggests vaccines will lead to demands for people to surrender their firearms, and the confinement of people in \\\"virus relocation centres\\\". There is no evidence whatsoever to support these claims.A recent report looking at the online conversation about vaccines in English, French and Spanish, found that the theme of liberty and freedom was more common in English, and particularly in the US.Seb Cubbon, one of the co-authors of the report from anti-misinformation non-profit organisation First Draft, told the BBC this could be down to a number of factors, including America's political history and the relationship that citizens perceive they have with the state.\\\"As always, we should genuinely respect and appreciate people's views and opinions, such as the one that vaccines undermine personal freedoms\\\" he said.\\\"But the case can also be made that vaccines actually increase people's freedom to do things they otherwise wouldn't be able to, and can also contribute to safeguarding other people's personal freedoms too.\\\"Additional reporting by Olga Robinson and Marianna Spring.","postDate":"2020-11-29T00:17:10.000Z","title":"Covid-19: What\u2019s the harm of \u2018funny\u2019 anti-vaccine memes? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/55101238"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/2048\/cpsprodpb\/C0CA\/production\/_113845394_ghana_reutersresize.jpg","author":"By Jack Goodman, Peter Mwai and Flora Carmichael","description":"As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases across Africa passed the one million mark this week, we've looked into some of the widely shared fake news about the pandemic on the continent.Claim: Ghana's president has endorsed a conspiracy theory videoVerdict: FalseA voice recording endorsing various false conspiracies about the coronavirus pandemic has been attributed to the President of Ghana. We aren't sure who's speaking. It is a West African accent, but it is definitely not President Nana Akufo-Addo.Ghana's Information Minister has confirmed that the voice was not the president's and said the claim was \\\"obviously false\\\".The message makes various unsubstantiated claims about the origins of the virus, including the widely-shared false notion that the pandemic was a planned event, a so-called 'plandemic'.It also features false claims about mandatory vaccinations and the involvement of Bill Gates in manipulating events.We've previously written in detail about these compulsory vaccine rumours and the 'plandemic' conspiracy theory.Different versions of the clip have been circulated in Europe, North America and Africa.One, posted on a Nigerian YouTube channel, has clocked up more than 400,000 views.The man who runs the channel says he changed the title of the video to \\\"Africa Leader...Exposes Bill Gates Deadly Vaccine For Africa\\\" after people in the comments pointed out it inaccurately named the Ghanaian president.However, Nana Akufo-Addo's photograph is still showing.Claim: Drinking alcohol can ward off coronavirusVerdict: This false claim was intended as satire, but has been widely shared in Africa.A satirical video of a man's reaction to the re-imposition of an alcohol sale ban in South Africa on a TV news channel has been viewed thousands of times on Facebook and is also circulating on WhatsApp.The video has been edited to replace a senior representative of the Liquor Traders Association of South Africa (who was being interviewed), with a comedian.The comedian Thandokwakhe Mseleku posted the video of his television appearance on Instagram and YouTube.In the video, he says: \\\"Sanitiser has got 70% alcohol, so if you are drinking alcohol, it is like you are sanitizing your inside.\\\"Judging by some of the comments to the video, people clearly thought it was real.The comedian later labelled his videos as 'parody'. We have asked Thandokwakhe Mseleku for a comment.Drinking alcohol-based hand sanitiser is extremely dangerous and has led to deaths. It certainly doesn't protect you from coronavirus.Claim: Eating high-alkaline foods can eliminate the virusVerdict: False.A misleading poster claiming to offer advice from inside isolation hospitals on what to do to protect someone from coronavirus has been circulating on social media in Africa.It claims that the 'acidity' of the virus can be eliminated by consuming high-alkaline foods, and lists a variety of fruits with their apparent pH levels.The pH scale ranges from zero (very strong acids) to 14 (most alkaline). A pH of 7 is neutral.Some of the values in the shared poster are way off this scale: Avocados register 15.6 and Watercress 22.7. This is simply incorrect.But would alkaline foods kill the virus?Different parts of the body have different natural pHs which are naturally kept in balance and can't be changed through diet. For example, blood is very slightly alkaline, your stomach is acidic.So eating certain foods would not have an effect on the pH level inside cells.\\\"Given that it would be impossible to increase the pH of your cells, then it's a bit of a pointless argument to determine if high pH would inhibit the virus\\\", says Connor Bamford, a virologist at Queen's University Belfast.According to Lee Mwiti, Chief Editor, Africa Check, the spread of misinformation on WhatsApp is a particular challenge for fact checkers.The messaging app is hugely popular across the African continent, but as a closed platform it is hard to measure the spread of falsehoods and debunk them. He says Africa Check's work with 'tiplines' and podcasts means they are \\\"quite confident that it is a strong source of misinformation\\\".Claim: A coronavirus vaccine trial in Africa has led to the death of two childrenVerdict: False.When two French doctors controversially suggested on French TV in April that early vaccine trials should be conducted in Africa, their comments caused an uproar, including among some in the African diaspora.A London-based vlogger responded to the French doctors' comments by falsely claiming that vaccine trials were already under way in Guinea, and made the further false accusation that two children had died as a result.The video was illustrated with what was claimed to be a local news report showing unrest on the streets and interviews with sick children.In fact, the news report was from March 2019, before the coronavirus outbreak began, and the incident was not related to a vaccine.The Guinean health ministry put out a statement at the time which explained some people had experienced side-effects after being given an anti-parasitic drug treatment.According to officials interviewed in the report itself and local articles, there were no deaths reported from this treatment.The claims in the video first surfaced in May and were debunked at the time, but they have continued to circulate on Facebook and closed WhatsApp groups, and have been watched around 25,000 times on YouTube.Local fact checkers are working hard to debunk these and other false stories circulating online.Lee Mwiti from Africa Check says the most shared and enduring falsehoods are those that have tapped into people's anxieties, vulnerabilities and \\\"lack of control in a time of unprecedented disruption\\\".Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter","postDate":"2020-08-08T23:22:11.000Z","title":"Coronavirus: Fact-checking fake stories in Africa - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/53684037"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/17A22\/production\/_118420869_cardiff6_gettyimages-1315593879.jpg","author":"By Steve Duffy 178.9m 134.2m 423.3m 45.9m 6.1m 471,051","description":"What can different statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales?Here, we regularly update some of the key areas of data for measuring the pandemic, covering case rates, Covid patients in hospital, the number of deaths and programmes such as vaccination and testing.We also try to explain some of the different measures being used.Where in Wales are most cases?Case rates can tell us how many people with Covid-19 symptoms are presenting themselves for tests that then come back positive.The low numbers show vaccinations are having an impact, with far fewer people experiencing symptoms, although the chief medical officer said Covid was still circulating and urged continued vigilance.Only four local authority areas have case rates in double figures, while Wales is averaging 39 new cases a day.This compares with 84 cases a day only a month ago and 2,864 cases a day at its peak in December.With so little between areas, small clusters or spikes in cases can lead to case rates fluctuating day-to-day, so it is important to look at the overall picture.All of Wales' 22 council areas have been under 50 cases per 100,000 - one of the key thresholds for easing restrictions - since the start of April.Newport currently has the highest case rate in Wales, at around 22 cases per 100,000. There are small clusters of cases across the city, with eight cases in the last week in Malpas, the only community in Wales counting as a local hotspot.But it is important to see it in context. It has been below the 50 cases per 100,000 threshold for six weeks and is picking up around five positive tests a day, compared to more than 200 at its peak. It is currently the 100th highest in the UK.Merthyr Tydfil is at its lowest levels since mid-August (under five cases per 100,000) and a long way from its peak a week before Christmas, when it stood at 1,349 cases per 100,000. A \\\"loss of discipline\\\" was blamed by health officials for a spike in March.Blaenau Gwent is currently the lowest in Wales at less than three cases per 100,000.Last month, both Swansea and Neath Port Talbot detected local hotspot spikes, which was blamed on people mixing indoors but these hotspots have now gone.The case rate in Bridgend fell dramatically after it peaked just before Wales was put into a pre-Christmas lockdown, on 20 December.It later plunged to single figures and has remained low.Denbighshire has the second lowest case rate in Wales but last week it recorded no positive tests at all over seven days, becoming the first Welsh county to do this since last August.Its peak came in early January, when it recorded 455 cases in a week.Wrexham is still above the Welsh average. But the rest of north Wales now has single figure case rates.Malpas in Newport has a case rate above 100 cases per 100,000, an example of what are known as middle layer super output areas (MSOAs).These are case rates broken down at community level, dividing Wales into 410 areas, each with a population of 7,000 on average.With low case numbers, these are now even more sensitive to local spikes and clusters.But 94% of these areas now have case numbers too low to register - two or fewer positive tests in the last week.How many tests are positive?The proportion of positive tests, alongside the case rates, has been regarded as an important indicator on the road out of lockdown.The positivity rate in Wales is 0.9%, its the lowest point since the summer.The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the positivity proportion of tests should be no more than 5% for a stable period before areas come out of restrictions.All areas are in single figures, 14 with a proportion of less than 1%, and for more than a month all have been within the 5% positivity threshold.On average, Wales has been below this threshold for more than two months.Why do we now look at cases per 100,000 going back about five days?Because of a lag in test results coming back Public Health Wales (PHW), we wait for those late results to come in before looking at what the picture is. It's a bit like in football, waiting on a Saturday evening for all the final scores to come in before looking at the league tables.The case rate is only a snapshot of the virus out there as it relies on people asking for a test. Others may have the virus and not know it, as they are asymptomatic.But since the end of last summer, when tests were fully available to anyone who thought they might have Covid, it has been a good measure.Before this testing phase, looking at case rates is less reliable for reading trends.The case rate in Wales for a period in December was one of the highest in the world. But it has been falling and has been the lowest rate of the UK nations for three months. At 8.6 cases per 100,000, it is at its lowest level since 28 August.What about variants?We know the dominant variant in Wales is now the UK Kent variant, which scientists believe could spread faster.With fewer case numbers, more positive test results are being analysed and sequenced in Wales, with more than 12,879 identified so far.They include around 2,350 historical cases which were sequenced but not reported before.There are currently 17 cases of the India variants detected in Wales. Early ones were connected to travel or close contacts.No further cases of other variants were sequenced in the latest week.How many people have been vaccinated?More than 1.9 million people in Wales have been given a first dose of Covid vaccine, while 846,180 have now been given the full course.So far, 61.4% of the Welsh population have had a first dose and 26.8% have had a full vaccination.The programme has been focusing in recent weeks on the younger age groups for first doses - with more than half of people in their 30s having had a jab.Vaccinations have also contributed to the estimate that 61% of people in Wales have antibodies to help protect against Covid-19.That figure ranges from 35.7% of 16 to 24-year-olds to 75% of those in their 50s.The estimate is more than 82% of age groups over 60, the highest with 83% of those 70 to 74 having antibodies present.Blood samples are taken for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) survey, which looks at antibodies for those who have either had a Covid infection in the past or have recently had a vaccination dose.How many people are infected?ONS also estimates the numbers who may have infections, in a weekly survey.It takes throat and nose swab tests from hundreds of households in Wales.It suggests that 1,500 in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 2 May, a further decrease.This is one in 2,070 people - or 0.05%. This compares to one in 1,570 people in the previous week.The positivity rate estimate is lowest in Wales than the other UK. It's 0.08% in England and 0.13% in both Scotland and Northern Ireland.Estimates range from one in 300 people in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, covering east Wales, to one in 560 people in Swansea Bay.The ONS also estimates that there were 0.46 Covid cases per 10,000 people per day in the week to 25 April in Wales, which would be about 140 new positive cases a day.Although small sample sizes, the survey also estimates 0.1% of the over 60-year-olds were infected, dropping to 0.08% of those under 22.How many people are in hospital with coronavirus?On 7 May, there were 186 Covid patients in hospital beds and the daily average (206) over the week is the lowest on record.Confirmed and suspected cases have seen a 42% drop in a month. This is a 96% drop from the record levels we saw in late-December.A total of three people were being treated on invasive ventilated beds, including in critical care, for confirmed or suspected coronavirus on 6 May. Last week saw the number drop to a record low of two. This is 98% fewer Covid patients than in mid-January.On 7 May, admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases were running at a daily seven-day average of 15. This is just above last month's record low of 13.There were 13 confirmed and suspected Covid patients admitted on Friday. There were none in Swansea Bay and there have been none in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg area for 10 days.Covid admissions now make up 1.4% of all hospital admissions.Have vaccines had an effect?The chart above shows how there has been a steeper decline in hospital admissions with Covid in the weeks after the peak of the second wave, compared to the first.This coincides with the roll-out of the vaccination programme to older and more vulnerable groups.What about infections in hospital?Public Health Wales has reported 19 hospital-acquired Covid infections in the most recent week. That is half the total in the previous week.These include six \\\"probable\\\" and \\\"definite\\\" cases in Swansea Bay.There have now been about 2,257 hospital-acquired cases reported across Wales since the start of 2021 and more than 7,100 since the pandemic began.Overall, 81% of Covid-19 infections occurred in the community - 19% were caught within or linked to hospitals.How many deaths have there been?The number of deaths involving Covid-19 was 14 in the latest week - the same total as the previous week.These accounted for 2.3% of all deaths, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).This is still lower than for any other week since 25 September and fluctuations are to be expected with numbers now so low.The trend has been for a steady decline and is 86% fewer Covid deaths than registered two months ago.During the latest week, up to 23 April - there were four deaths in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area, three in Aneurin Bevan and Cardiff and Vale, two in Powys and one each in Hywel Dda and Swansea Bay.There were none across the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board area for the third week in the last four.When broken down by local authority area, there were no deaths involving Covid registered in 12 counties: Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Ceredigion, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire, Neath Port Talbot, Pembrokeshire, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Torfaen.What about 'excess deaths'?So-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, are now below the five-year average for the eighth successive week.Looking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in a typical year is seen as a reliable measure of the pandemic.The number of deaths from all causes in Wales fell to 616 in the week ending 23 April. This was 45 deaths fewer than the five-year average.That below average proportion (-6.8%) is greater in Wales than England and all but the south east and eastern regions for this week.Deaths in Scotland and Northern Ireland were above average for this latest week.When looking across the course of the pandemic so far, there have been 43,044 deaths from all causes, 7,860 (18.3%) mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate. This was 5,645 deaths above the five-year average.When deaths occurring up to 23 April but counting later registrations are included, the total number of deaths involving Covid rises to 7,863.We can see the two distinct waves of the pandemic in Wales.The second wave was more sustained - over nearly four months from late-October to the end of February there were more than 4,800 deaths. The peak came on 11 January, when there were 83 deaths.The first wave over two months - March to May 2020 - brought more than 2,100 deaths. The peak came on 12 April with 73 deaths.Is there a Welsh hotspot?The hotspot was in the Aneurin Bevan health board area of south-east Wales in the early stages of the pandemic and then Cwm Taf Morgannwg.Over the summer, Betsi Cadwaladr health board, in north Wales, showed more of a spike in Covid-19 deaths compared with health boards in south Wales.In the second wave, the impact was more widespread. The peak in Bridgend in January saw the mortality rate rise to 1,277.8 deaths per 100,000 (159 deaths) and in December it was worst in Neath Port Talbot (962.8 deaths per 100,000, 117 deaths).We can also see the second wave was longer lasting in north Wales, right into February and March.When looking at crude death rates - based on local populations - Wales has three areas in the highest 20 across England and Wales.RCT has 366.4 deaths per 100,000 in total so far in the pandemic, the seventh-highest in England and Wales. Merthyr is on 346.4; Bridgend is 340.7.Gwynedd has the lowest in Wales and 10th lowest across England and Wales on 104.4 deaths per 100,000.The ONS has also broken down the deaths of those with Covid-19 into local areas - called middle layer super output areas, usually with average populations of around 7,000 people.We can see in the 13 months since the pandemic began, Rhondda Cynon Taf has six communities in the highest 20 in Wales.This shows 57 deaths in Tonyrefail due to Covid being the worst, followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot (52) and Porth East in RCT (48 deaths).Only Porth East of these has shown a rise since last month.When translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Llanelli Bigyn is the highest. followed by Port Talbot East.When we just look at March, the highest numbers were in Holyhead on Anglesey and Penarth in the Vale of Glamorgan (four deaths).There were also three deaths in nine other communities.But two-thirds of communities had no deaths from Covid at all in March.And there is one community remaining which has had no Covid deaths at all through the pandemic - Llandudno Junction South and Llasanffraid Glan Conwy.What about deaths in care homes?There have been a total of 1,670 Covid-19 deaths in care homes up to 9 April, making up 21.3% of all coronavirus deaths in Wales.Looking at all deaths in care homes, ONS calculated there were 24.2% more than average over the course of 2020. That's 1,339 excess care home deaths. The two waves of the pandemic saw nearly 159% more care home deaths than normal in April and 37.3% more in December.Similar figures are reported by, Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW), which showed they have been notified of 8,841 deaths among adult care home residents, from all causes, since 1 March 2020.Of these, 1,920 deaths involving confirmed or suspected Covid, which makes up 22% of all reported deaths. The number at the second wave peak was more than those in the first wave.The latest CIW report said it had not been informed of any Covid-related death since 26 March.CIW is now updating its figures every two weeks.There was one care home deaths in Wales - in Powys - where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate in the latest ONS weekly total in Wales.What else can we tell?The ONS has published figures which suggest the mortality rate - when it is age standardised - is 1.8 times as high for Covid-19 deaths in Wales' poorest areas than its least deprived ones.There were 283.3 deaths per 100,000 population in the 13 months to the end of March in the most deprived areas.This compares with 150.6 deaths per 100,000 in least deprived parts, according to the ONS figures.As fewer people went to hospital in the pandemic, deaths in people's own homes in Wales were a third above normal levels last year, according to ONS analysis.It found 2,610 more deaths at home in 2020, compared to the average in the previous five years. So-called excess deaths in people's homes were higher in every month of 2020 apart from February. For those aged over 85, deaths at home were 38% above average.How do deaths from Covid-19 compare to other causes, like flu?After four successive months, Covid-19 is no longer the leading cause of death in Wales, analysis shows.Deaths due to Covid also fell significantly in March for a second consecutive month, the Office for National Statistics said.Heart disease and dementia\\\/Alzheimer's disease have now overtaken Covid as the biggest causes of death.Two-thirds of communities across Wales experienced no deaths due to Covid at all in March.Covid accounted for 6.3% of all registered deaths over the month - it was 22.2% in February and 35.2% in January.The mortality rate due to Covid-19 in Wales has fallen to 65.2 deaths per 100,000 in March - its lowest rate since September.Heart disease is now the leading cause of death in Wales (121.2 deaths per 100,000 people). Lung cancer is the fourth; flu and pneumonia is the seventh leading cause, considerably below the five-year average.Are deaths really 'due to' Covid-19?The ONS analysis finds that Covid-19 was the underlying cause of death in 71.3% of cases in March, where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate.A doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution.It was the underlying cause of death in 189 deaths in March - 6.3% of all deaths.How does Wales compare with the rest of the UK?On age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR), over the 13 months of the pandemic, the mortality rate has been higher in England than in Wales, both for deaths involving Covid - and deaths due to Covid.But if you take a crude mortality rate instead - not accounting for population and age profiles - and based purely on death numbers and population figures, then Wales is higher than in England.The ONS uses the ASMR in its analysis.Who is being tested in Wales?More than 3.3 million tests had been carried out by 2 May, including 1.5 million on key workers and care home residents.There were 66,234 tests in the most recent week, slightly fewer than the week before. This is nearly half of the testing we saw in the week before Christmas and an indication of far fewer people presenting themselves with symptoms and the impact of the vaccination programme.That total figure includes more than 30,000 care home residents and workers tested routinely during the week. This is a steady number each week, so the numbers presenting themselves with symptoms for tests will be far fewer.The number also includes 16,000 tests involving hospital patients, which leaves about 20,000 weekly tests of people reporting symptoms and being tested at a testing centre or with a home test.Wales has access to 37,000 laboratory tests per day currently if required, with about 15,000 of this capacity at NHS Wales labs.A total of 38,975 people in their 20s have also tested positive - only 50 more than last week's figure. That age group makes up just over 18% of all positive tests and has done consistently for a few months.The highest weekly proportional rise in positive tests was again the under-nines (0.25% - but just 23 positive tests).The most recent analysis of tests among university students found one case in the past seven days.Separate figures, now published weekly, show 80.5% of schools have been affected by the virus since September.There have been 4,485 cases in staff and 5,938 in pupils from September, up to 28 April.There were 42 new cases in staff and pupils in the last week - another fall - and 160 over the past three weeks.We can also see from more detailed PHW figures how many different key workers and others have been tested - and how speedily results are coming back.What about testing in care homes?There were just 22 positive tests in elderly care homes in Wales in the most recent week, the lowest recorded since the restart of the routine weekly testing programme in September.Back in early-January, the number hit 1,500 in the peak week.Care home testing of elderly residents is continuing on scientific advice, despite the vaccination programme having now given full doses to more than 89% of residents and more than three quarters of staff.Across Wales, around 28,500 residents and staff were tested in the week beginning 26 April, as part of the weekly testing regime.The vast majority of test processing from care homes is done by Lighthouse labs but their results do not distinguish between residents and staff. There were 14 (0.05%) positive tests results from these labs from 26,311 tests.From the other tests processed by NHS labs, we can see 1,510 care home residents were tested and just eight (0.5%) were positive.Numbers of care home workers were too low to be published.Care Home Inspectorate Wales also publishes separate figures around testing. The most recent show only seven (0.7%) care homes in Wales had notified one or more positive cases in staff or residents in the past week - down from 12 (1.1%) in the previous week and by far the lowest number since the figures started being published in December. Sixteen local authority areas had no cases and only Powys had more than one.Only 32 (3%) of care homes had notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in staff or residents, in the past 20 days. It was 6.5% a month ago.No Covid death has been notified since 26 March and deaths overall have been below average in April.What about tracing contacts?The drop in tests and cases in turn means fewer people to trace - 45% fewer cases and 41% fewer contacts than a month ago.The \\\"test, trace, protect\\\" system for contacting people with coronavirus and tracing contacts was dealing with up to 8,200 people a day during the second wave peak, but that is down to 100-300 at most.Only 365 positive cases were eligible for follow-up in the most recent week - a 10% drop on the week before; 99.2% were reached, with 94% reached within 24 hours of referral and 97.5% were reached within 48 hours.This equates to 93.9% of those successfully reached being reached within 24 hours and 98.3% within 48 hours.It's estimated that 10% of contacts of an infected person develop Covid. Of the 1,093 close contacts that were eligible for follow-up, 94.9% were reached within 24 hours.What are the differences between measures?The ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way - and information is available at different times so do not expect to see the same thing.Public Health Wales' daily updates on its online dashboard show numbers of deaths and positive tests for coronavirus.Can we compare the two sets of figures?The graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from all the different data sources - and how there is a difference between ONS and PHW and also between ONS and the UK Government count, which is of people who died within 28 days of a first positive test for Covid.There is a difference of about 2,310 deaths.The daily PHW figures here are presented as a rolling average, not as the day they are first reported as these can be incomplete.By 1 May, there was an average of 0.3 deaths a day - down from a peak of 48 deaths averaging on 3 January and the lowest since late-September.No deaths occurred on 20 March - the first day this has happened since 24 September. There have been no further deaths occurring on 12 other days since.There were 58 deaths occurring on 1 January, the highest daily figure in the pandemic. The 13 worst days for deaths occurring, as reported by PHW, were during the second wave in late-December and January.","postDate":"2021-05-10T14:27:09.000Z","title":"Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-wales-52380643"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/BA4E\/production\/_118449674_mondaystats.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"There have been 227,840 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 7,661 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to the Scottish government.This page analyses the key figures for the coronavirus outbreak in Scotland.Page updated using figures available at 14:00 on 10 May.Confirmed cases of Covid-19There have been 1,335 cases detected over the past seven days, with 168 confirmed on Monday.The following chart shows the number of daily confirmed cases after an NHS Scotland or UK government test since 1 September, along with a seven-day average.The actual number of people infected during the course of the outbreak will be far higher than the overall confirmed cases figure, as many people who have Covid-19 are not tested.Scotland's second wave has seen a much bigger surge in the number of cases because many more people are being tested.The vaccination programmeThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December.Currently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.Older age groups are being prioritised in Scotland's vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.This next chart shows the progress made so far across all age groups, according to official figures.Some younger people have already had the vaccine because they have been prioritised as health or social care workers, or because they have a condition which makes them particularly vulnerable to Covid-19.The Scottish government's aim is to offer a first dose of the vaccine to everyone in Scotland aged 16 or over by the end of July.Deaths from Covid-19The first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.The spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.The rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.The chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths, so the most recent figures are subject to revision.There are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.The Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.The NRS also publishes monthly data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.Excess deaths from most causes rose significantly last year - the exception was deaths from respiratory diseases, where the number was much lower than average.How many cases are there in my area?The number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.Recent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart uses figures from a few days ago.The rate is calculated by adding up all the cases over the previous seven days and then dividing by the population of the local authority. This number is then multiplied by 100,000.The Scottish government also publishes figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.How many people are in hospital?The coronavirus outbreak has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals during both the first and second waves of the pandemic.At the peak of the outbreak in the spring there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, including over 200 in intensive care wards.Numbers reduced over the summer, but started to rise steadily again in September. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital passed the spring peak of 1,520.Only patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.They are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.However, the Scottish government now publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.How is the share of positive tests changing?The World Health Organisation (WHO) highlights the percentage of positive test results as a key measure when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.The organisation says that a positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that rates of community transmission of Covid-19 are at low levels.Other measures include declines in cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions.The Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.This is different to the WHO's preferred way of measuring the positivity rate, which is through \\\"sentinel surveillance\\\", or random community testing.However, the organisation lists \\\"overall test positivity\\\" as an additional measure if a comprehensive testing system is in place.What is the estimated R number in Scotland?The R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.If the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.The Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.Figures for all charts from Scottish government data.","postDate":"2021-05-10T14:24:49.000Z","title":"Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-scotland-53511877"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/1536\/cpsprodpb\/1614D\/production\/_112254409_1500-pa-53696421.jpg","author":"By Michelle Roberts 4 months Longer Last October Drink only","description":"The UK's coronavirus alert level is being lowered from four to three on the advice of experts.Alert level three means that although the virus is still in general circulation, transmission is no longer high or rising exponentially.It comes as Boris Johnson is due to confirm at a No 10 briefing that England's pubs can serve indoors in the latest easing of lockdown next Monday.The PM may also announce guidance that it is safe to hug friends and family.Mr Johnson is expected to confirm England will move to the next stage of the government's road map for lifting England's lockdown at the 17:00 BST news conference.He will be joined at the briefing by England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and the UK government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance.The decision on the alert level was due to the efforts of the public in bringing Covid rates down, said a statement from the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, along with NHS England national medical director Stephen Powis.Cases, hospital admissions and deaths have all decreased and vaccines are having the desired protective effect, with the latest figures showing a third of UK adults are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19, and two-thirds have had their first of two doses.\\\"However Covid is still circulating, with people catching and spreading the virus every day so we all need to continue to be vigilant. This remains a major pandemic globally,\\\" the medical experts said.The UK moved to the highest Covid alert level - five - in January as the nation was put into lockdown and there was a real risk of the NHS becoming overwhelmed. By late February, the alert was lowered to four.But the alert system, which follows recommendations by the Joint Biosecurity Centre, is independent from government decisions on easing or tightening restrictions.Health Minister Nadine Dorries said \\\"the data is looking extremely positive\\\" when she was asked if the guidance would change to allow hugging between friends and family who were not in the same household or support bubble.\\\"We've all missed the hugs, we've all missed the close and intimate contact we've had with friends and family and so I'm hopeful that we will be hugging and kissing again indoors,\\\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.She stressed that people should take this step \\\"a little bit cautiously\\\" to protect people who may be vulnerable and avoid a resurgence of the virus, however.Prof Cath Noakes, a member of the Sage committee that advises the government, said that if the guidance does allow hugs, they should be selective, brief, and people should avoid face-to-face contact to minimise the risk of spreading the virus.In stage three of the government's road map for lifting England's lockdown, people will be able to meet in groups of up to 30 outdoors, while six people or two households can meet indoors.People are also likely to be allowed to stay overnight with those not in their household or bubble. Pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues, such as cinemas and soft play areas, are set to be permitted to reopen indoors.As part of other measures expected to be relaxed, the rest of the accommodation sector is to reopen, along with indoor group sports and exercise classes.And up to 30 people are to be allowed to attend weddings, receptions and wakes, as well as funerals.Foreign holidays will also return. On Friday, the government announced that 12 destinations would be placed on England's travel green list, meaning anyone returning from those areas will not need to quarantine from 17 May.Each stage on the roadmap out of lockdown has been separated by a gap of several weeks to allow scientists to assess the impact of previous changes, which in stage two included the reopening of non-essential shops and outdoor service in pubs and restaurants.The government has to be satisfied that its four tests have been met, which depend on the successful rollout of vaccines, evidence that jabs are reducing serious illness and death, infection rates being under control and the risk from coronavirus variants not changing.The devolved nations are working to their own timeframe for easing restrictions.In Wales, indoor hospitality such as pubs, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and museums are expected to reopen from 17 May. All tourist accommodation is due to reopen and wedding receptions can have up to 30 people indoors and 50 outdoors.In Scotland from 17 May, indoor hospitality venues are expected to resume with alcohol being served until 22:30. Cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls should reopen and indoor group exercise restart.More restrictions may be lifted in Northern Ireland on 24 May, including the reopening of indoor hospitality, B&Bs and hotels. Indoor group exercise could resume and wedding receptions and funeral wakes restart.","postDate":"2021-05-10T14:21:30.000Z","title":"Covid alert level reduced as lockdown set to ease - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/health-57055340"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/14E50\/production\/_118448558_hi067249189.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"Tánaiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar has hailed Monday as a \\\"day of freedom\\\" for the Republic of Ireland as Covid-19 restrictions were further eased.The Republic had been at the highest level of restrictions - level five - since Christmas.But close-contact services, such as hairdressers, are now reopening and click-and-collect retail has resumed.People are now also able to travel across the country.They can move outside their own county for the first time in more than four months. Sports training can also resume.Mr Varadkar told RTÉ's Morning Ireland programme on Monday that 12,000 businesses were due to reopen this week and 100,000 people could return to work.He said the current financial support for businesses would be in place until the end of June.This could not continue forever, he said, but changes would be gradual and the government would continue to support the business community to give them a chance to bounce back after a very difficult year.Testing is also being rolled out in schools and universities, he said.The easing of restrictions in the Republic of Ireland is part of a phased relaxation of the country's strict Covid-19 lockdown announced by Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micheál Martin in April.Libraries, museums, galleries and other cultural attractions are also opening.Mr Martin said the relaxations would give people \\\"a significant psychological uplift\\\".The measures permit people to travel for non-essential journeys outside their county and up to 50 people can attend weddings, funerals and other religious services.Three households, or a group of six people, can meet outdoors, including in private gardens, and a vaccinated household can meet an unvaccinated one indoors.Last week, Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann asked his counterpart in the Republic of Ireland, Stephen Donnelly, for a meeting to discuss the potential spread of Covid-19 from cross-border travel.The letter stated that both governments should be doing \\\"all we can to prevent non-essential cross-border travel\\\", and \\\"clear messaging\\\" and enforcement should be used, if required.Mr Swann called for the Irish government to elicit an \\\"appropriate and proportionate\\\" response to recent transmission data on both sides of the border.It followed the news that seven cases of the Indian variant of Covid-19 had been detected in Northern Ireland.It is the first time it has been confirmed in Northern Ireland, but three cases were detected in the Republic of Ireland last month.Mr Donnelly said he did not believe new Irish cross-border travel restrictions were \\\"warranted\\\", given the current Covid-19 situation, although he is expected to speak to Mr Swann about the issue later this week.In recent days, there have been calls for a ramping up of the Covid-19 vaccination programme to curb a spike in infection rates in County Donegal.Donegal currently has the highest rate of Covid-19 in the Republic of Ireland.Last week, 84 cases of Covid-19 were linked to a wake in County Donegal.What is due to open?From 17 May, all non-essential shops in the Republic of Ireland can reopen to customers.From 2 June, hotels, guest houses and self-catering accommodation will be permitted to trade.All pubs, regardless of whether they serve food, along with restaurants can open for outdoor service on 7 June.The summer relaxation is premised on containing new variants and accelerating a vaccination programme that is well behind Northern Ireland's.","postDate":"2021-05-10T14:17:56.000Z","title":"Covid-19: 'Day of freedom' as restrictions eased further - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-57023440"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/1091C\/production\/_114186876_2.png","author":"By Michelle Roberts","description":"Wearing of face coverings in secondary school classrooms in England will not be required after 17 May, the government is expected to confirm.Face coverings have been recommended since the return to school in March - but that will end as part of the phasing out of lockdown measures.What are the rules for face coverings?Face coverings and masks reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and speaking.Currently, people in the UK are asked to wear them where social distancing is not possible and the virus could easily pass between people - for example on public transport, or in shops.Cutting transmission is important because there is still lots of the virus circulating and many people are yet to be protected by vaccination.The exact rules can be seen here for:In England and Northern Ireland the police can issue a £200 fine for not following the rules. In Scotland and Wales, a £60 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines.Will we have to keep wearing masks or face coverings?US health advisors now say people who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 can gather unmasked with others who have been vaccinated.They can also visit unvaccinated people from one other household indoors without masks or distancing so long as the unvaccinated people are not at high risk for severe Covid-19. But they should still wear masks when out in public.The UK has yet to make such recommendations, however.Once more people have had a vaccine and more is known about how they affect the transmission of Covid, other measures to limit its spread can be reviewed, the government says.This will include the wearing of face masks or coverings.They might still be needed in some circumstances and particularly during winter, however.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he hopes they would become the norm on public transport as a matter of \\\"personal responsibility\\\".Do pupils have to wear masks at school?Why should I wear a mask?The main purpose of face coverings is to protect other people from coronavirus, rather than yourself. If everyone wears one, the risk for all goes down.When worn correctly, they should cover the nose and mouth - the main confirmed sources of transmission.They can help to reduce the spread of the virus from people who are contagious, including those who have no symptoms.There is also evidence they can offer some protection to the wearer, although they are not a replacement for social distancing and hand-washing.Face covering, mask or both?Tips for the wearer include:The highest level of protection is provided by FFP3 (or similar) masks worn by healthcare workers in high risk settings to safely do their job.In some countries, such as Germany and Austria, medical-grade masks (such as disposable surgical ones) are compulsory on public transport and in shops.These are made from non-woven fabric, which is better at stopping spray and droplets.Cloth face coverings do not give the wearer as much protection.But the World Health Organization says it has no plans to change its guidance recommending fabric face masks for the general public.Who is exempt from wearing face masks?Some people do not have to wear a face covering. They include:Young children should not wear face masks because of the risk of choking and suffocation.Can I make one myself?The BBC has created a guide on how to make your own face covering.The government has issued its own advice too.What do I need to know about the coronavirus?","postDate":"2021-05-10T13:25:46.000Z","title":"Coronavirus: What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? -

with the latest plans for lockdown restrictions due to be announced in the Welsh government's next three-week review on Friday.In an open letter to ministers, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective (WIRC) renewed its call for Covid restrictions to be eased on the hospitality sector and for financial support at least matching that available in England and Scotland.The group, representing more than 400 cafes, pubs, restaurants and hotels, urged the Welsh government to allow any six people to sit together indoors and to scrap the two-metre social distancing rule.The letter said it is \\\"not a case of following England for its own sake, but a recognition that the science is the same there as it is here\\\".\\\"The closer we align our rules across the UK, the easier it is to communicate those rules to an increasingly confused public,\\\" it adds.Meanwhile, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the recovery of the NHS from Covid was \\\"going to be a huge task\\\" he thought would \\\"take a full Senedd term\\\".Speaking earlier at an NHS distribution centre in Newport that was preparing to send equipment to India, he said the pandemic was \\\"not quite over yet\\\", with ongoing pressure from long Covid, for example.The NHS is also facing a huge backlog of treatment and operations that have been delayed because of coronavirus.Mr Gething said: \\\"You simply can't recover in a matter of months - and that's the level of honesty I think we need with the public and with our staff.\\\"He warned the recovery of the NHS would take time \\\"partly because of capacity but importantly because our staff need to be cared for as well\\\".Welsh Labour has budgeted to spend at least £1bn extra on NHS recovery.Mr Drakeford said on Saturday that Wales' response to the Covid pandemic had been a major part in Labour's election win as they were returned as the largest party for the sixth successive time since devolution in 1999.\\\"A government I lead will continue to follow the science to do what our medical advisers tells us we should do, and that does mean doing things in a way that continues to keep Wales safe,\\\" he said.The Welsh government controls Wales' Covid response and the relaxing of restrictions - such as meeting inside pubs and restaurants and travel rules - has tended to have been more cautious in Wales.Election headlines:The new Senedd is expected to meet for the first time in the next week to elect a presiding officer and deputy presiding officer to conduct proceedings.Then, once those posts are filled Labour will then be able to re-nominate Mr Drakeford as first minister - with no significant challenge from the opposition expected for his reappointment.He may, however, need help from the opposition to pass laws and get Labour's spending plans through the Welsh Parliament, with one seat short of a majority.\\\"We have demonstrated over a number of governments that you can govern successfully on 30 seats, but I'm open to working with any party where there is common ground between us,\\\" he said.Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds, their only Senedd member, has ruled out joining the Welsh government like her predecessor Kirsty Williams did.","postDate":"2021-05-10T13:23:31.000Z","title":"Covid: Welsh Labour cabinet talks after election win -

Here's what we can expect from the Scottish government's timetable for easing restrictions as we move into the summer.17 May - meeting indoors and cinemasAll council areas - with the possible exception of Moray - are expected to move from level three to at least level two.In this tier, people will be allowed to meet up inside others' homes - initially in groups of up to four people from no more than two households - and they can stay overnight.Children under the age of 12 are not included in the limit on numbers - but they are counted in the limit on the number of different households.Adults from different households should still maintain two-metre social distancing but young children are not required to do so. Rooms should be well ventilated and there should be no sharing of food or utensils.Indoor hospitality is expected to resume with alcohol being served and pubs or restaurants allowed to stay open until 22:30 with two-hour time-limited booking slots. There will still be a limit of six adults - but they can now come from three different households, whereas before it was two.Restrictions on meeting up outdoors will ease further - up to eight adults from eight different households can meet up. When meeting outdoors, children under-12 do not need to be counted for either the total number of people or the household limit.Cinemas, bingo halls and amusement arcades can reopen. Adult outdoor contact sports and indoor group exercises can resume.Outdoor and indoor events such as concerts can also restart, but with limited capacity. Small indoor seated events are advised to have a maximum of 100 people, outdoor grouped standing events have a capacity of 250 and outdoor seated\\\/open space events are limited to 500.More students will be back at university or college but with blended learning continuing. Face-to-face support services such as counselling can operate.Travel across the whole of Scotland was permitted in the previous phase of easing - but a complication may arise if restrictions are not eased in Moray because people must not enter a level three area from a lower tier unless for a permitted reason.People will still be urged to work from home where possible. Places that will remain closed include soft play, funfairs, indoor bowling, snooker halls, nightclubs and adult entertainment.Early June - bigger social gatheringsThe hope is that from 7 June, all of Scotland can move to level one with a greater relaxation on the numbers allowed to meet up.Up to six adults from three households will be allowed to socialise indoors and stay overnight.In cafes, pubs, restaurants and other indoor public places the limit will be eight adults from three households, and premises stay open until 23:00, serving food and alcohol.As before, children under-12 do not count towards the total numbers for indoor socialising but should be included for the household limit.Outdoors 12 adults from 12 households can meet, still with two-metre social distancing between households.The number of people allowed at weddings or funerals rises to 100, double the previous limit.People are still urged to work from home where possible.Nightclubs and adult entertainment venues must remain shut - but all other leisure and entertainment businesses can now open.Small seated indoor events will be permitted but are advised to have a maximum of 200 people. Outdoor standing events can cater for 500 and up to 1,000 are permitted at outdoor seated or open space events.Late June - near normalityIf all goes well it is hoped that areas can move to the lowest level of Covid restrictions - level 0 - in late June.Up to eight adults from four households will now be able to meet indoors and stay overnightIn indoor public places like pubs and cafes the limit is now 10 adults from four households.Outdoors 15 adults from 15 households can meet up.As before children under-12 do not count towards the total number of people , but when indoors they should be included in the number of households.Wedding and funerals can now be attended by up to 200 people.People will still urged to work from home where possible but there will be a limited and phased return to offices.Nightclubs and adult entertainment will remain closed, except for use in \\\"limited circumstances\\\".Seated indoor events can host up to 400 people, outdoor grouped standing events have a capacity of 1,000 while outdoor seated or open space events can have up to 2,000 attending.In England, Boris Johnson has said he hopes all legal restrictions on social contact can end on 21 June. The Scottish government has not given a similar undertaking but Nicola Sturgeon has said that her aim is to have further easing later in the summer as the number of people vaccinated increases.All these plans are subject to review and contingent on continued success in suppressing the virus but could also be accelerated.What are we allowed to do at the moment?Since 26 April the whole of Scotland has been in level three.Almost all non-essential businesses have been allowed to open, including gyms for individual exercise and close contact services such as nail salons.Pubs, bars, cafés, restaurants and bars can serve people outdoors - in groups of up to six people from six households - until 22:00. Alcohol is permitted, and there will be no requirement for food to be served.There has been a partial resumption of indoor hospitality - food and non-alcoholic drinks can be served until 20:00 for groups of up to six people from no more than two households.Contact details still need to be collected and everyone visiting a hospitality setting must remain at least a metre apart from the next person, unless from the same household or a carer.You can travel anywhere in Scotland and stay in holiday accommodation but cannot stay overnight in someone else's home. Travel to England, Wales and Northern Ireland is also permitted.Swimming pools are open for individual exercise, driving lessons and tests can place, and non-essential work in people's homes has resumedAll secondary schools returned to full-time classroom teaching after the Easter break.The number of people allowed to attend a wedding or funeral is currently 50.A minimum of two indoor visits a week are permitted for care home residents.Do you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.Note: The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University, which results in a slightly lower overall total. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands.Confirmed cases have been rising steeply since the middle of last year, but the true extent of the first outbreaks in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.The 100 millionth Covid case was recorded at the end of January - about a year after the first officially diagnosed case of the virus.Deaths have also been rising, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries.Data on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases.Who has vaccinated the most?Several coronavirus vaccines have now been approved for use, either by individual countries or groups of countries, such as the European Union and the World Health Organization (WHO).Of the 181 countries and territories administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, 68 are high-income nations, 96 are middle-income and 17 low-income.The map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.Overall, China and the US have given the most doses, with about 326 million and 260 million respectively, while India has administered almost 170 million so far.But when breaking the figures down by doses per 100 people in countries with a population of at least one million, Israel and the United Arab Emirates top the list.Most countries are prioritising the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable.Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine.Several African countries have received vaccines through the Covax initiative, with vaccinations now underway in Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Kenya and Rwanda, among others.Where are cases still high?With many countries now having started widespread vaccine rollouts, the number of daily cases is stable or falling in most regions.Asia, however, is the notable exception, mostly due to India's recent surge in cases.Here's a breakdown of the situation by region:AsiaAsia was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from China in early 2020, but the number of cases and deaths there was initially lower than in Europe and North America.However, the recent surge in cases in India, Nepal and Japan is changing the picture.India, which has the second-highest number of cases in total after the US, is currently seeing about 400,000 new confirmed cases every day.The healthcare system is under extreme pressure, with hospitals at full capacity and daily reports of oxygen shortages.The total number of coronavirus deaths reported in India is more than 246,000 - still well behind the numbers recorded in the US and Brazil.However, with many people avoiding testing, or struggling to access it, and deaths in rural areas often going unregistered, the actual death toll could already be much higher.As the chart below shows, India is far from the only country in Asia with rapidly climbing infections and many are experiencing the highest number of cases since the pandemic began.EuropeSeveral European countries have seen spikes in Covid cases in recent months.But the number of daily infections has slowed in the worst affected countries, such as Turkey, France and Germany, and the overall trend in Europe is downward.Vaccine rollouts across the European Union have been problematic.There have been delays to deliveries and concerns over the safety of the Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccine, which a number of countries have withdrawn from use or restricted to certain age groups.North AmericaThe US has recorded more than 32 million cases and about 580,000 deaths, the highest figures in the world.Daily cases now appear to be levelling off after a steep fall in February.Canada, which has a far lower death rate than the US, also experienced a recent surge. Daily cases there fell in January before rising in March and April.Latin AmericaIn Latin America, there has been particular concern about a variant of the virus that has been spreading rapidly in Brazil.The country has recorded more than 15 million cases and 420,000 deaths - the world's second highest death toll - but the number of daily infections has slowed since March.Argentina, Colombia and Mexico have all recorded more than two million cases.Middle EastSeveral countries in the Middle East have had severe outbreaks of the virus, with Iran and Iraq having seen the highest numbers of deaths.Iran has the highest official death toll in the region and the country has recently experienced its biggest spike in cases.Israel, which has rolled out a highly successful vaccination programme, has seen its number of daily infections drop significantly in recent months.AfricaAfrica has recorded more than 4.6 million cases and more than 120,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic in many African countries is not known as testing rates are low.South Africa, with nearly 1.6 million cases, is the worst affected country on the continent, according to official figures.Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia. Egypt, Libya, Nigeria, Kenya and Algeria have also recorded more than 100,000 cases.OceaniaAustralia and New Zealand have been praised for their response to the pandemic, with both countries having seen comparatively few deaths.In a sign of how effective their lockdown measures have been, the average number of cases in both countries is similar to that in French Polynesia, a sprawling network of islands in the Pacific Ocean.Elsewhere in the region, Papua New Guinea saw a recent spike in infections, taking total cases there to nearly 12,000.How did coronavirus spread?Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time.About this dataThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, national governments and health agencies, as well as UN data on populations.When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.","postDate":"2021-05-10T11:38:40.000Z","title":"Covid map: Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-51235105"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/3F38\/production\/_118448161_be4d91e2-64b2-40e2-901c-32612164deda.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"Dozens of people have died since a wave of protests started to sweep across Colombia on 28 April.Protesters have blocked key roads leading to shortages of fuel and food in some areas and there have been violent clashes between the security forces and demonstrators.The government has agreed to meet protest leaders but with more and more groups joining in the protests, the demands of those who have taken to the streets have widened and a quick resolution seems unlikely.BBC News takes a closer look at what triggered the protests and how they have grown.How did they start?The demonstrations started on 28 April and were initially in opposition to a proposed tax reform.The government argued that the reform was key to mitigating Colombia's economic crisis.Colombia's gross domestic product dropped by 6.8% last year, the deepest crash in half a century. Unemployment shot up as the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc on the economy.The proposed reform would have lowered the threshold at which salaries are taxed, affecting anyone with a monthly income of 2.6m pesos ($684; £493) or more. It would also have eliminated many of the current exemptions enjoyed by individuals, as well as increasing taxes imposed on businesses.The rallies on 28 April were organised by Colombia's biggest trade unions, but were also joined by many middle-class people who feared the changes could see them slip into poverty.Tens of thousands of people marched in the capital Bogotá but there were also demonstrations in other major cities and smaller towns.After four days of protests, President Iván Duque announced he would withdraw the bill.How did protests escalate?From the start, there was a big police presence at the marches as they were held in defiance of a court order which had ruled that they should be postponed due to the high incidence of Covid-19.Human rights groups reported that riot police had not only used tear gas to disperse protesters but in some cases shot live ammunition.Footage shared on social media showed violent clashes and on 3 May, the ombudsman's office confirmed that 16 civilians and one police officer had died since the protests began.So rather than abating after the cancellation of the tax reform, the protests intensified.In Bogotá, more than a dozen police stations were attacked and police said hundreds of their officers were among the 800 people injured in clashes.What do protesters want?While this year's protests were triggered by the now-suspended tax reform, they are a continuation of nationwide anti-government protests which began in November 2019.Back then, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets after a call by an umbrella group calling itself the National Strike Committee.The same group is behind the current protests and its demands are as varied as the people who are joining in the marches.One of the issues which has most angered protesters is the actions of riot police.On 4 May, the United Nation's human rights office accused Colombia's security forces of using excessive force and said it was \\\"deeply alarmed\\\" by reports that police had opened fire on protesters.Police violence has hit the headlines before. Last September, news that a man died after being tasered by police in Bogotá triggered violent protests in which at least seven people were killed.And in 2019, tens of thousands marched after teenager Dilan Cruz died after being hit a by projectile fired by riot police at an anti-government protest.The protesters want the riot police to be disbanded and for all members of the security forces to be held accountable by an independent body rather than by military courts.The defence minister said that the protests had been infiltrated by members of left-wing rebel groups and pointed to incidents of vandalism and looting.But protesters argue it is time the security forces, which for decades were engaged in an armed conflict with powerful rebel groups, treated them like citizens rather than enemies.What role does poverty play?Many of the protesters' demands are rooted in Colombia's high levels of inequality. The coronavirus pandemic has made the lives of many Colombians more precarious, with unemployment spreading and 3.6m Colombians being pushed into poverty.In cities like Quibdó, in the north, 30% of people live in extreme poverty and even in Medellín, Colombia's economic powerhouse, that figure amounts to 9%, according to official sources.Some of the protesters argue that only the introduction of a universal basic income will ease inequality while Colombia's young are demanding that tuition fees be dropped so that more can access university education.Indigenous groups have also joined in the protests. They are among those hardest hit by the continuing violence in rural areas where dissident members of the Farc rebel group fight the security forces as well as rival armed groups.Twenty indigenous leaders are among 60 rights defenders killed since the beginning of the year, according to a tally by peace institute Indepaz, and Colombians are demanding that the state do more to protect those standing up for rural, indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities.What does the government say?President Duque has ruled out one of the protesters' main demands - the dismantling of the riot police. Nevertheless he struck an optimistic note ahead of talks with the National Strike Committee but urged demonstrators to clear the roads they have blocked. \\\"Yes to conversation ... but no to roadblocks,\\\" he said.\\\"Colombia has to pull together to move forward after all the blows we were dealt during the pandemic,\\\" he said.He also addressed young people in Valle del Cauca, the region where the violence has been at its worst, tweeting that \\\"we know of your demands and proposals and there will be a space to hear you out and talk about the issues worrying you. Let's together reach concrete solutions quickly\\\".","postDate":"2021-05-10T12:48:28.000Z","title":"Why Colombia's protests are unlikely to fizzle out - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-latin-america-56986821"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/1024\/cpsprodpb\/18569\/production\/_118398699_comp3.jpg","author":"By Jessica Lussenhop and Zhaoyin Feng","description":"In the pandemic, hundreds of Chinese migrants who lost their jobs moved to a remote city on the Navajo Nation Indian reservation in New Mexico, to do what they thought was legal agricultural work. Instead, they and the local Native community found themselves pitted against one another in a bizarre cautionary tale about the boom in cannabis production in the US, and the impact on Asian migrant labourers.When Xia (not her real name) first heard about the job as a \\\"flower cutter\\\", she pictured roses.Details were scant, but a roommate told her it was 10 days' work for $200 a day, room and board included. Unemployed in the pandemic and unable to send money back to her adult children in southern China, Xia had been living at one of the crowded boarding houses common in the large Asian immigrant enclave of LA's San Gabriel Valley. The job sounded like a fine temporary solution.In early October, Xia and five other women made the 11-hour drive to the outskirts of Farmington, a small city nestled in the stunning but sparsely-populated high desert of northern New Mexico. When they arrived, their new boss checked them into a bright pink, roadside motel called the Travel Inn.In a series of rooms on the first floor, Xia and her co-workers sat in chairs around heaps of plant material that were delivered by rental van in the night, trimming the \\\"flowers\\\" off the top. These were definitely not roses - the fan-leafed plants reminded Xia of àicǎo, or silvery wormwood, which the Chinese burn to ward off mosquitoes. The piles smelled so strongly that the odour hung around the motel like a cloud.But for the moment, Xia was content. A convivial middle-aged mother of two, she had worked many jobs since arriving in the US in 2015 - home carer, nanny, masseuse. This was a lot less lonely.\\\"I was happy. I could talk to other people at work,\\\" she recalls in Mandarin. \\\"I much prefer cutting flowers.\\\"Just three days into their work, there was a knock at the door. Xia assumed it was someone calling them to dinner, until she saw men in uniforms with badges. Initially, it was impossible to communicate, until an officer who spoke Mandarin arrived. He asked the workers if they knew what kind of \\\"flowers\\\" they were cutting. One by one, they shook their heads.\\\"I wasn't afraid. I thought, 'I didn't commit any crime,'\\\" recalls Xia. \\\"When they put the handcuffs on me, I realised it's serious.\\\"As a police convoy drove the workers to jail, someone attempted a joke: \\\"Hey, we are almost 60 years old, and it's our first time being handcuffed and riding a police car!\\\"With no translators to help communicate with law enforcement or her court-appointed lawyer, Xia says that for days she did little more than sit on her bunk and cry. She assumed the worst: that whatever she'd done would land her in prison doing hard labour, and she would never make it back home.\\\"I thought, 'My life is over,'\\\" she says. \\\"I thought of my son, and that he wouldn't even know if I died in America.\\\"Meanwhile, her mugshot and those of her co-workers were all over the local news. They'd been charged with multiple felonies for trafficking, conspiracy and intent to distribute a controlled substance: high-grade marijuana.What Xia did not know was that over the summer, about 30 minutes up the highway from the bright pink motel, a massive marijuana farming operation had sprung up in the tiny town of Shiprock on the Navajo Nation reservation. Hundreds of Asian migrant workers like herself had flocked there from all over the US to live and work on the farms, having lost their jobs due to the pandemic.It was part of a recent, surprising expansion of Chinese-American investment into the US cannabis industry. Investors sought to recoup losses from shuttered restaurants, spas and tourism businesses by ploughing millions into cannabis - all despite the fact that marijuana remains a social taboo in the Chinese immigrant community.While hardly the only minority community interested in cannabis, in rural parts of the US, the Asian workforce stood out. This set the stage for a bitter fight with locals on the Navajo Nation, where unscrupulous entrepreneurs took advantage of the complex and confusing laws governing the industry, and set the farms on course for disaster.\\\"Everybody at one time was for the hemp because they lost their jobs in the pandemic,\\\" recalls one Navajo Nation resident. \\\"And then all of a sudden things changed... I think it turned everybody against one another.\\\"The view from the top of Bea Redfeather's property on the Navajo Nation is breathtaking and severe. To the southwest is the cathedral-like Tsé Bitʼaʼí, or Shiprock pinnacle, a giant rock which rises nearly 1,580ft (480m) from the desert floor. Redfeather, a petite, 59-year-old tax accountant and silversmith, has lived here almost 30 years.\\\"This was peaceful,\\\" she says, looking out over the horizon. \\\"Calming.\\\"All that changed in early June, when Redfeather saw an enormous lorry jostling down the narrow frontage road that separates her property from her neighbour's. A group of men got out and started unloading equipment into the empty field.It astonished Redfeather that on a reservation where new development is tightly controlled by tribal bureaucracy, a large-scale farming operation was going up across the street without her even hearing about it. The Navajo Nation was also struggling with a severe coronavirus outbreak, one of the worst in the country, and movement on and off the reservation was supposed to be tightly controlled.She decided to record what was going on on her phone.\\\"They're like, 'What are you doing here?'\\\" she recalls. \\\"These are non-Natives. So of course, I fired back saying, 'What are you doing here? You guys aren't allowed here.'\\\"Not long afterwards, Redfeather says that San Juan River Farm Board president Dineh Benally drove up, and came over to speak to her. She says he asked her how they could resolve the situation.\\\"I says, 'I'm going to stop you and what you're doing.' And you could see it in him. He was angry,\\\" she recalls.Benally, a former civil engineer for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the eldest son of a formidable tribal politician, was well known for his ambition to introduce the profitable cultivation of hemp and marijuana on the reservation.New Mexico legalised medical marijuana back in 2007, but state laws have no bearing in Indian country, which is governed by federal and tribal law. In 2017, Benally lobbied hard for a bill that would have legalised medical marijuana in the Navajo Nation. He called his efforts a \\\"crusade\\\" in memory of his late mother, who died of pancreatic cancer.\\\"Her last four months of her life she suffered,\\\" he told the tribal council, according to the Navajo Times. \\\"She didn't have the medication to have a better part of life.\\\"The bill, however, was withdrawn before it ever came to a vote.Benally saw another way into the industry after the 2014 and 2018 Farm Bills made it legal to grow industrial hemp. Like marijuana, hemp comes from the cannabis plant, but it contains almost no THC, the psychoactive compound that causes a user high. However, before hemp can be farmed, the state must first create a system to regulate production, including a way of testing THC concentration. Benally tried to convince the Navajo Nation leadership to do this so that the tribe could begin generating much-needed income from textiles and CBD oil products. But the council never showed much interest.The same year the medical marijuana bill stalled, Benally ran unopposed for the San Juan Farm Board, an entity with limited powers over farming permits on the reservation. This new position, Benally apparently believed, gave him the authority to approve his own hemp \\\"pilot project\\\".Through his lawyer, Benally declined to be interviewed for this story or to provide a statement: however, he has previously strongly denied any breach of the law.\\\"The Navajo - we have the land and the water. We need an entity to help us hit the ground running,\\\" he told a reporter in 2019, boasting that he already had 100 acres of hemp growing on his property.Around this time, a friend of Benally's introduced him to Irving Lin. An irrepressible 70-year-old who immigrated decades ago from Taiwan, Lin made his fortune in California real estate but has no interest in an idle retirement. His enthusiasm for Chinese investment in marijuana is tempered only by his wife, whom he says will not allow him to profit directly from the sale of marijuana. Instead, he runs informational seminars in Los Angeles - mostly for Asian American business people drawn to marijuana cultivation as a way to bolster their flagging business portfolios.\\\"This is very good for our Chinese people to go into,\\\" he says. \\\"I think cannabis sooner or later will be one of the Chinese major businesses.\\\"Lin remembers Benally explaining that the Navajo Nation was a sovereign country, and that he could \\\"control their decision\\\". Lin began acting as matchmaker between his seminar participants and Navajo landowners who were interested in subleasing to the Chinese. This eventually amounted to millions of dollars in investment. These newly-minted farmers started going to their networks of family and friends to find labour.\\\"Suddenly so many people go there. Every day people are looking for a house, looking for land in a very short period. In six months, we had 1,000 people go there.\\\"Bea Redfeather was seeing the results at her doorstep. Twenty-five \\\"hoophouses\\\", inexpensive greenhouses made of steel frames with heavy-duty plastic covering, appeared seemingly overnight next door. Some farms that had previously grown traditional Navajo corn varieties now had hundreds of hoophouses, lined up in neat rows that stretched to the horizon.\\\"Corn is a sacred plant,\\\" Redfeather told Searchlight New Mexico, the first media outlet to do an in-depth investigation into the farms. \\\"You can't eat hemp and marijuana.\\\"Redfeather became obsessed with documenting the growth of the hemp farms in Shiprock on her Facebook Live. Her videos show heavy machinery grading the fields, trailer homes arriving on the back of trucks, and septic tanks being dug into the ground - the kind of major redevelopment that would normally take years to get approved. Before long, the air all around Shiprock hung with the smell of marijuana.The Navajo Nation police had been watching Benally, too. They suspected the \\\"hemp\\\" that he had been growing on his own land was actually marijuana. But according to Navajo Nation Police Chief Phillip Francisco, to shut him down, they had to prove that his crop's THC levels were higher than 0.3%. With no drug lab of their own, Navajo police sent samples to an outside agency.While the Navajo police waited, the pandemic hit.\\\"After Covid started, we started seeing a lot of these farms spring up fast,\\\" says Francisco, who had only 180 patrol officers trying to enforce health mandates over a 27,000sq-m (70,000 sq-km) reservation. \\\"I think that's what he took advantage of.\\\"The situation was yet another example of just how complex law enforcement in Indian Country can be. Benally's interpretation of tribal hemp laws got his farms started. Meanwhile, because so many of the workers showing up in Shiprock were non-Native, the tribal police had no authority to charge them with anything. Similarly, the San Juan County Sheriff and the Farmington Police Department had no jurisdictional power on the reservation or over Native workers.The next step would be to involve federal authorities like the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the FBI - but they have limited staffing and can be notoriously slow to respond.The farms continued to grow throughout the summer, until there were 36 hemp operations in total.\\\"I've never seen anything like that in my 22-year career,\\\" says Chief Francisco. \\\"Never would we have worried about this magnitude of an operation, right under our noses.\\\"When Navajo police responded to complaints, the workers told them they had permission from the landowners to farm there - it turned out that 33 Navajo farmers had signed agreements to sublease their land to people like Benally, and Chinese investors. Like the migrant workers, many Navajo were suffering income losses during the pandemic, and these non-Native investors were paying cash. The farmers provided official-looking \\\"provisional cannabis cultivation\\\" licences, issued by Benally's farm board.\\\"We said yes to hemp when [we thought it was] legal,\\\" one landowner told the BBC before hanging up.For Redfeather, the final straw came one morning when a worker from the nearby hemp farm gestured threateningly with what looked like an AK-47 at her mother, who was sitting on their porch drinking coffee.\\\"I was angry. Really, really angry,\\\" she says. For protection, she bought a rifle of her own.Using her new-found social media capital, Redfeather began organising protests against the hemp farms. They called themselves Kéyah - or land - Protectors. In the first protest, roughly 100 Shiprock residents shut down a road through town carrying signs that said things like, \\\"We Don't Need Chinese to Farm\\\" and \\\"Hemp is Not the Navajo Way\\\". A young boy on a microphone shouted, \\\"No Asian invasion!\\\"\\\"This is in no way a racial issue,\\\" one resident told the Navajo Times, which broke many of the earliest stories about the unfolding disaster. \\\"They use all our resources within the community starting with the land, water and people\\u2026 That's not right.\\\"The protests led to tense confrontations between anti-hemp Navajo residents and the Navajo farm owners who had sublet their land for hemp.\\\"You're a traitor!\\\" protesters yelled at a farm owner across the gate in one particularly heated demonstration.In another video, Redfeather comes face-to-face with a tall, barrel-chested young man in a tactical vest and a skull face mask pulled over his nose and mouth.\\\"Isn't your dad a medicine man?\\\" Redfeather shouts at him as he blocks her path on to the farm.The young man - 25-year-old Brandon Billie - didn't particularly mind these confrontations. As Dineh Benally's head of security, Billie liked the excitement of chasing thieves and vandals off the farms. More importantly, it was steady work at a time when jobs were scarce.\\\"He hired anybody who was willing to work,\\\" Billie says. \\\"The income was low and all that. But it was something. It was a job.\\\"As threats to the workers became more frequent, Billie moved into a mobile home alongside the Asian workers. He communicated with them using translation apps and says they hosted cookouts together. The Chinese made spicy noodles and roasted a whole pig's head for the Navajo workers. The Navajos cooked fry bread, mutton stew and blue corn mush in return. Billie started to dream about one day visiting his new friends' hometowns in China.\\\"I called them my brothers and sisters,\\\" he says.But the job was causing problems at home. Although his father initially supported his son's work in hemp, that position became untenable as public opinion turned against the farms. When Billie told his family that he had too much riding on the farms to quit, his father cut off communication.On the frigid morning of 9 November, Billie had just made a cup of coffee and was about to go back inside his trailer when he heard a loud thud. He turned to see police vehicles crashing over a small dirt hill towards the camp. He says officers jumped out with AR-15s pointed at him, handcuffed him and put him into the back of a state trooper's vehicle.The same dramatic scene was playing out on farms all over Shiprock. After weeks of planning, a massive task force had finally mobilised, including dozens of officers from Navajo, state and local police, as well as agents from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Homeland Security and the Environmental Protection Agency.Over the course of three days, \\\"Operation Navajo Gold\\\" tore through the farms and seized crops. They quickly proved what everyone already knew: the farms were full of marijuana, not hemp. Agents recovered 60,000lb (2,700kg) of it on 21 farms and in two private homes. In one greenhouse, they found 1,000lb (450kg) of fully-processed marijuana already placed in baggies for individual sale.Billie and dozens of farm workers were transported to the gymnasium of Shiprock High School. In the same room where the principal had handed him his high school diploma, Billie was grilled by an FBI agent about what he knew about Benally's operation.Unlike the workers from the Travel Inn, no-one was arrested. The labourers were met by several Mandarin translators from the FBI, and Lynn Sanchez, from the New Mexico Human Trafficking Task Force. It was her job to provide services to the workers now that their homes and job sites had become an active crime scene.\\\"They looked very scared,\\\" says Sanchez. \\\"I just remember looking at this older man, he had to be about 65 or older than that. He had tears in his eyes that just wouldn't fall.\\\"The task force and another organisation called Life Link were able to provide funds for travel and compensation for lost wages to a few dozen workers.Others simply disappeared. Chief Francisco says in the first days after the raid, he heard reports of Asian workers trying to hitchhike and sleeping rough.Sanchez says that the conditions she saw on the farms, with some sleeping outdoors or on wooden pallets, without access to proper sanitation or medical care, were clear signs of labour trafficking. However, applying the \\\"trafficking\\\" label is complicated, both in a legal sense and for the workers themselves, no matter how squalid the conditions.\\\"In the informal economy, it might be completely exploitative and it doesn't mean that person is not choosing to do this,\\\" says Erin Albright, founder of New Frameworks, an anti-trafficking organisation. \\\"There are no other options for them.\\\"Sanchez found that some of the workers did not accept that they were \\\"victims\\\" and declined her assistance.\\\"It was by mutual consent,\\\" one 36-year-old worker told Initium Media, a Hong Kong digital magazine that interviewed many of the Chinese workers in Shiprock. \\\"No-one forced me to do anything.\\\"Sanchez and her organisation were also told by a public defender that the 17 workers from the Travel Inn motel were still somewhere in Farmington. They found Xia and her five friends sharing another cheap motel room. After their release from jail, a judge told the flower cutters not to leave New Mexico. They'd been holed up in the room for 10 days, unsure of what to do next, living on nothing but plain rice porridge.By that point, however, the county prosecutor had been convinced that the women had not knowingly been part of a drug cartel. He dropped the charges. Using funds from Sanchez's trafficking task force, Xia and her friends drove back over the mountains to California.When her children in China asked why they hadn't heard from her in so long, Xia lied.\\\"I told them my mobile phone was broken. If they know the truth, they'd be worried,\\\" she says.\\\"Thinking back,\\\" she adds, \\\"it's like a nightmare.\\\"Back in the boarding house, Xia was able to rest for a few weeks. But there was still no work and coronavirus case numbers began to surge once again in Los Angeles.She heard from her friends that some workers had gone directly from the Shiprock farms to ones in Oklahoma - the latest frontier in the marijuana gold rush. A friend told Xia she could get a job with her in a massage parlour, and after that, maybe they could go back to farm work.\\\"All jobs are tough,\\\" she remembers thinking. \\\"I still need to endure, to make a living and to support my family.\\\"So once, again, Xia packed her things and drove off towards the unknown.Oklahoma City's Asia District is a roughly 10-block stretch of Chinese grocery stores, bubble tea shops and restaurants, dotted on either side of a busy four-lane thoroughfare. Near its centre is the Fujianese Association of Oklahoma, which opened its doors in late 2020.In a room decorated with Chinese and American flags, men play mahjong at two tables as others stand around watching. The air is thick with cigarette smoke, the sound of clinking mahjong tiles, and occasional bursts of laughter and cursing.Dressed in T-shirts, jeans and sneakers, the men range in age from their 30s to 60s. One of them says they are mostly restaurant entrepreneurs who'd moved to Oklahoma to take part in the booming marijuana industry.According to Irving Lin, at least a dozen Chinese investors he knows took their workforce and what little they could salvage from the New Mexico farms straight to Oklahoma.\\\"You stopped me in New Mexico. I immediately go to Oklahoma,\\\" Lin says. \\\"So what? Next!\\\"Others were not so lucky. One California investor told the BBC that she'd lost all her savings and the home she put up as collateral.Some of the luckier investors were at the Fujianese Association, but none would speak about their experiences in New Mexico. Asked directly by the BBC, a few only smile politely and shake their heads.\\\"What is cannabis?\\\" one player asks with a cheeky smile. \\\"None of us knows anything about it!\\\"Eventually, a sophisticated-looking man in a long wool coat - a single AirPod hanging from one ear - arrives at the club. He says his name is Michael, and though he wasn't involved in the Shiprock venture, he is well aware of the debacle. He points out three men puffing cigarettes at one of the tables, and says he knows they lost their investment there.\\\"You can try,\\\" he says softly in Mandarin, \\\"but I don't think they'd talk to you about New Mexico.\\\"Later, in a conversation over the phone, Michael explains that the investors involved in Shiprock are embarrassed for having unknowingly broken the laws and suffered financial losses. Besides, many in the Chinese community still consider marijuana a dangerous narcotic drug, and the men are not eager to discuss it with reporters.At the beginning of the pandemic, Michael, who's in his 50s, saw the economic fallout coming and sold his three acupuncture businesses on the east coast. He came to Oklahoma in June, after convincing a few Fujianese friends to pool their money. He says they now own several legal cannabis-related businesses, including a farm and an agricultural equipment store, even though he says he's never even smoked marijuana.Michael says most of his workers are Fujianese restaurant workers who came from all over the country, landing them - improbably - at the buckle of the Bible Belt, in a state better known for its cowboy history and staunchly Republican politics.\\\"If it weren't for the pandemic,\\\" says Michael, \\\"I'd have never come here.\\\"Since legalising medical marijuana in 2018, this socially conservative state has rapidly become the country's hottest weed market due to its hands-off regulatory approach. The cost of obtaining a cannabis licence in Oklahoma is just $2,500, compared with tens of thousands of dollars in other states. The state also has no cap on how many licences can be issued.As a result, it's in the midst of a \\\"green gold rush\\\", says Matt Stacy, an Oklahoma City attorney who helps clients secure cultivation licences. He estimates he has about 300 Chinese clients.\\\"I didn't expect it,\\\" he says. \\\"It grew quickly.\\\"Though the cost of entry is low in Oklahoma, the cannabis business is by nature extremely capital and labour intensive. The Chinese immigrant community in the US has both resources, on a large scale.Recruitment is often done through word of mouth, cannabis groups on Chinese messaging app WeChat or sometimes through hometown associations like the Fujianese social club. There are also employment agencies in Chinatowns across the US, matching Chinese-run businesses with low-wage immigrant workers.In a state where the Asian population is about 2%, the newcomers haven't gone unnoticed. Jayne and Vic Grissom obtained one of Oklahoma's first cultivation licences in 2018 and run a small, sleek dispensary outside Oklahoma City. Last August, when a group of Chinese men purchased an 80-acre plot and built a huge farming compound across the street from their home, the couple was surprised.\\\"Oklahoma is not a very diverse state,\\\" Jayne explains. \\\"To have that many Chinese coming in, especially where we are, which is really rural, I just found it really bizarre.\\\"The couple - who grow three shipping containers of \\\"craft cannabis\\\" with names like 66 Cookies, OK Boomer, Spicy Berry - are concerned that these new, large-scale growers will flood the market with product or begin shipping it illegally across state lines to sell. It is only legal to grow marijuana for consumption in Oklahoma.\\\"It's the wild, wild west here,\\\" says Vic. \\\"It's a gold rush, or a curse for Oklahoma, I don't know which one.\\\"Chinese American cannabis farm owner \\\"Aaron\\\" does not want his real name used, but happily opens his gates to visitors. In his flip-flops and sweatpants, a cigarette always balanced on his lips or between his fingers, Aaron proudly shows off his weed empire.For a man who just months earlier had zero experience growing marijuana, the fledgling operation is astonishing in its scale. The farm contains several warehouse-like buildings filled with countless cannabis plants. It's like a botanical garden, but with the ambience of an assembly line. About a dozen Chinese workers sit on small benches among the bushes, carefully pruning the adolescent plants.Aaron's employees stay in a house just down the road, a couple of rambunctious puppies in the yard. That afternoon they were preparing to make a massive batch of fishball soup from fish they caught in a pond behind the property.Aaron, too, hails from Fujian. He was smuggled into the US on a ship as a teenager decades ago, when illegal immigration from Fujian was rampant.Life was tough in the first years. Aaron endured back-breaking work and harsh living conditions when working in restaurants across the country, in places like Maine and Ohio. He still vividly remembers the despair he felt, when he arrived at strange new cities with all his belongings in a backpack and no clue where he was.\\\"My only option was to bear hardship and not to complain,\\\" Aaron says in Mandarin. \\\"If I had lost my job, I wouldn't know where I could go.\\\"He learned English on the street, eventually obtained a green card, and went on to make his first pot of gold in the restaurant industry in Florida. He claims he once owned more than 30 restaurants there.Aaron now employs workers with similar backgrounds to Xia's, who are relatively new to America and willing to take labour-intensive jobs to survive. But Aaron thinks things are much better than when he first arrived in the US, with mobile phones to keep in touch with family back home, a more established Asian immigrant network in the US and hence, greater leverage with the employers.\\\"I treat them as my grandpas and grandmas,\\\" he says with a big smile on his face. \\\"The Chinese people are very adaptable. We find ways to survive in all sorts of situations.\\\"That does not mean that life in Oklahoma for the recent transplants has been easy.\\\"When the police see Asian faces in an out-of-state car, they will order you to pull over,\\\" says Michael, claiming he has been pulled over three times in Oklahoma by police officers. \\\"They inspected every little corner in my car.\\\"Under federal and state laws, law enforcement officers can seize cash based only on the suspicion it was earned from or used to commit a crime. Michael says this is a big problem for an immigrant community accustomed to doing everything in cash - for example, he says he has never owned a credit or debit card in his 30 years living in America.Matt Stacy, the cannabis lawyer, takes on several cases involving forfeited cash every week, in some instances, for tens of thousands of dollars.\\\"We have to prove over and over that the money that someone was lawfully carrying with them is actually their money.\\\" He believes the practice has a disproportionate impact on his Asian immigrant clients, many of whom don't speak English well.\\\"The fact is, this is an unbanked industry,\\\" Stacy says - as marijuana is not yet decriminalised federally, bank options are limited for cannabis entrepreneurs.After the debacle in New Mexico, the Oklahoman farmers are even more concerned about the presumption by locals and law enforcement that their operations are not above board. And there are already signs of trouble. In late April, the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics raided a cannabis farm, which has a legal medical marijuana licence but allegedly sold large quantities of its product on the black market. Eleven people were taken into custody, who, the police say, are potential owners and workers from Taiwan and China, and do not speak English. A bill that requires licence holders to disclose any \\\"foreign financial interest\\\" in marijuana businesses is moving through the state legislature.Nevertheless, Irving Lin insists the majority of Asian farmers are complying with Oklahoma law.\\\"They are good people,\\\" Lin says. \\\"They are doing nothing wrong. They need to take care of the family.\\\"While Lin still sees a bright future in cannabis in Oklahoma, back in Shiprock the community is in disarray.The farms now lie empty. Inside abandoned mobile homes and barely insulated plywood shacks, the contents of every cupboard, drawer and closet are strewn across the floors, likely the work of law enforcement searching for evidence. The air smells of sewage and rotting food. Clothes still hang in the closets. Toothbrushes sit beside sinks. Outside, empty bottles and Chinese cigarette packets tumble across the fallow fields.\\\"All we see is plastic. We see trash. We see dead marijuana plants,\\\" says Bea Redfeather. \\\"That's what they left us with.\\\"In the November 2020 election, Redfeather ran for San Juan Farm Board president and won, unseating Benally. She is sticking by her campaign promise to strip the 33 Navajo landowners of their farming permits, and trying to figure out how to start the huge cleanup. The Navajo Nation attorney general's office has also sued the landowners.Seventeen of those farmers have banded together to form a new, pro-hemp farmers' association, claiming they \\\"were unaware of hemp operator principal Dineh Benally's intentions to grow illegal crops\\\". A lawyer representing the group says they may even sue for what they say was an overzealous law enforcement response that included pointing guns at elderly Navajo landowners.Benally has left Shiprock, where he is facing charges of conspiracy, aggravated assault and interfering with judicial proceedings.Because a federal investigation by the DEA and FBI is still open, it's not clear how many migrant workers were in Shiprock, or whether charges for any of the farmers or investors are being considered. According to Sanchez, momentum is building behind a labour trafficking inquiry, thanks to cooperation from the Travel Inn workers.Brandon Billie also no longer feels welcome in the Navajo Nation. Today, he works in health care in a nearby town, pulling long, late-night shifts. During the day, he sleeps in the back of his battered SUV in the parking lot. He has an apartment near Shiprock but stays away for his and his family's protection.\\\"Shiprock has changed so much,\\\" he says. \\\"I just don't feel welcome no more.\\\"Gone, too, are the dreams of travelling to China. He says he tried to stay in touch with his favourite workers, but one by one they stopped responding.Xia's experience in Oklahoma was short and disappointing, as well. The flower trimming work never materialised, and she wound up working as a masseuse again. The friends who did make it on to the farms told her to stay away.\\\"The snow is very heavy and thick,\\\" they warned.She decided to cut her losses and go back to LA.In March, a gunman on a shooting spree in Atlanta, Georgia, killed eight people - six of them Asian women. The murderer targeted massage businesses similar to the ones Xia has worked in for years, and the victims included Korean and Chinese immigrants who, like her, travelled all over the country searching for work. The killings came after weeks of reported increases in hate crimes and violent attacks against Asian Americans, particularly women, across the US.As a result, Xia no longer wants to work in spas, further narrowing her already scant job prospects. Even though she hasn't made the amount of money she was hoping to send home to her family, she's not sure how much longer she will stay in the US.\\\"I often hear about Chinese people getting beaten up. We remind each other to be careful,\\\" she says. \\\"It's so scary. It's like living in terror.\\\"After everything she'd been through, Xia says she's still happiest among the fan-leafed plants of the cannabis farms. A few months after her return to California, she finds work at an outdoor grow where the hours are long and the sun beats down on her back. The job is seasonal and sporadic, but anytime she can, Xia says she will be back on the farm.\\\"If you don't mind the hardship and tiredness,\\\" she says, \\\"a day at the farm passes quickly.\\\"Additional reporting and photography by Xinyan Yu; illustration by Katie Horwich","postDate":"2021-05-08T23:01:07.000Z","title":"Chinese dreams on Native American land: A tale of cannabis boom and bust - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-56835897"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/158D2\/production\/_118447288_gettyimages-1227979467.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"A man's death from flames ignited by candles and perfumes during a prayer session has prompted a warning from one of Nigeria's biggest churches.The Celestial Church of Christ, whose members wear white one-piece garments and attend services barefoot, is popular in western Nigeria but has branches across the country, and abroad.Kayode Badru had been praying with lit candles during a privately organised session for him at the church in Lagos last Monday when the incident happened.Church elders had been praying for Mr Badru and it is thought that the priest leading the session then sprayed some perfume on him, which was ignited by a nearby candle.The flames quickly engulfed Mr Badru who had been wearing the white garment of the church, which is usually made from flammable fabrics such as cotton or silk.He died in hospital on Thursday from the burns he sustained.Imolemitan Ojo, a senior pastor of the church, told BBC Pidgin that the priest who led the prayer session and some other elders who were present had been arrested by the police.Prayers in the church are usually conducted with lit candles and perfumes, symbolising light and good aura.Members usually source their own perfume which they take to services but it can also be bought within churches.The perfumes are not intended to be sprayed excessively and members are advised to dilute them with water. It is not known if this was done with Mr Badru.A statement released by the church reminded members that \\\"spiritual perfumes intended to be sprayed, sprinkled, or poured with a lighted candle should be diluted with water\\\".\\\"The spraying or pouring of undiluted Spiritual Perfumes in its volatile state with a lighted candle is an imported culture not originally part of the tenets of the Celestial Church of Christ,\\\" the statement said.Mr Badru, a rich Nigerian living in Dubai, had reportedly visited the church, where he is a member, for a thanksgiving ceremony.One report said he was in Nigeria for the graduation ceremony of 40 people he sponsored to attend an art and technology academy.Founded in 1947 by Rev Samuel Biléhou Oshoffa in Porto-Novo, Benin, the Celestial Church of Christ says it now has branches all over the world.","postDate":"2021-05-10T13:50:15.000Z","title":"Nigeria's Celestial Church of Christ warns against spiritual perfumes - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-africa-57057896"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/133BF\/production\/_106938787_getty_scarf.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"Hundreds of Palestinians and more than 20 Israeli police have been injured in clashes in Jerusalem.The latest violence follows a month of rising tensions, though the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians has gone on for decades.How did it start?A 100-year-old issueBritain took control of the area known as Palestine after the ruler of that part of the Middle East, the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in WW1.The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority.Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave Britain the task of establishing a \\\"national home\\\" in Palestine for Jewish people.For Jews, it was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 40s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe and seeking a homeland after the Holocaust of WWII.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also grew.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city.That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.The creation of Israel and the 'Catastrophe'In 1948, unable to solve the problem, British rulers left and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the state of Israel.Many Palestinians objected and a war followed. Troops from neighbouring Arab countries invaded.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \\\"Catastrophe\\\".By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory.Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza.Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement - each side blamed the other - there were more wars and fighting in the decades which followed.The map todayIn another war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, and Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank, and although it pulled out of Gaza the UN still regards that piece of land as part of occupied territory.Israel claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise Israel's claim to the whole of the city.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in these areas, where more than 600,000 Jews now live.Palestinians say these are illegal under international law and are obstacles to peace, but Israel denies this.What's happening now?Tensions are often high between Israel and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank.Gaza is ruled by a Palestinian militant group called Hamas, which has fought Israel many times. Israel and Egypt tightly control Gaza's borders to stop weapons getting to Hamas.Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank say they're suffering because of Israeli actions and restrictions. Israel say it is only acting to protect itself from Palestinian violence.Things have escalated since the start of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan in mid-April 2021, with nightly clashes between police and Palestinians.The threatened eviction of some Palestinian families in East Jerusalem has also caused rising anger.What are the main problems?There are a number of issues which Israel and the Palestinians cannot agree on.These include what should happen to Palestinian refugees, whether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removed, whether the two sides should share Jerusalem, and - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside Israel.Peace talks have been taking place on and off for more than 25 years, but so far have not solved the conflict.What does the future hold?In short, the situation isn't going to be sorted out any time soon.The most recent peace plan, prepared by the United States, when Donald Trump was President - called \\\"the deal of the century\\\" by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu - has been dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Any future peace deal will need both sides to agree to resolve complex issues.Until that happens, the conflict will go on.Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.","postDate":"2021-05-10T12:55:26.000Z","title":"Jerusalem violence: The Israeli-Palestinian situation explained - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/newsbeat-44124396"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/9898\/production\/_118446093_boriscarrieepa.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"Boris Johnson is being investigated by the MPs' standards watchdog over the funding of a Caribbean holiday in 2019.Commons standards commissioner Kathryn Stone has confirmed she is looking into whether the prime minister correctly declared how the trip was paid for.Mr Johnson has previously declared he received accommodation worth £15,000, covered by Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross.Downing Street said the prime minister had acted correctly and transparently.But Labour said there were \\\"questions\\\" over Mr Ross's \\\"generosity\\\".The commissioner normally investigates whether MPs have failed to declare a financial interest, not declared it correctly, or declared it late.Mr Ross initially said he had not paid \\\"any monies\\\" for the trip Mr Johnson took with his partner Carrie Symonds to the private island of Mustique - part of St Vincent and the Grenadines - between Boxing Day 2019 and 5 January 2020.He later clarified that he had \\\"facilitated\\\" accommodation for the prime minister.Mr Ross added that Mr Johnson's declaration of a \\\"benefit in kind\\\" in the February 2020 MPs' register of MPs' interests had been \\\"correct\\\".But Labour asked for the standards commissioner to investigate, saying Mr Johnson's entry appeared \\\"to be incorrect\\\".Possible sanctionsOn Monday, Ms Stone confirmed that the prime minister was among nine MPs currently being investigated for potential breaches of the MPs' code of conduct.She is examining whether Mr Johnson followed Commons rules on declaring financial interests relating to trips outside the UK.These state that MPs have to register visits costing more than £300, where these have not been wholly covered by MPs themselves or the taxpayer.Ms Stone will report her findings to the Commons Standards Committee, which can order MPs to apologise or pay back money if they are found in breach of the code.In extreme cases it can recommend MPs are suspended, although this requires approval from the whole Commons and has only happened a handful of times.Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: \\\"The public have a right to know who paid for Boris Johnson's luxury Caribbean holiday and the renovation of his flat.

I lead the Labour Party and it is entirely on me.\\\"Sir Keir said that his deputy, Ms Rayner, had \\\"a big, new role, taking the fight to the Tories\\\".But his reshuffle, announced late on Sunday following hours of wrangling behind closed doors, is already facing criticism from figures within the party.The moves came after Labour lost control of eight councils overall in English local elections, and suffered an historic defeat to the Conservatives at a by-election in Hartlepool.The party fared better in Wales, where it won half the seats in Welsh Parliament elections, as well as in several mayoral races in England.Labour also took the West of England and Cambridgeshire and Peterborough mayoral posts off the Tories, and prevailed in the first race for the new West Yorkshire mayor.Labour MP and former actress Tracy Brabin - the first woman to become a metro mayor - has stepped down from her role in Westminster to take up the new post.But this means the party will soon face another by-election in her seat of Batley and Spen, which has been held by Labour since 1997.Labour was also re-elected in Greater Manchester, where its successful mayoral candidate Andy Burnham urged the party to learn the lessons of its victories.He added that the party was too focused on a \\\"civil war\\\" between figures from different factions, which would prove \\\"absolutely pointless and destructive.\\\"Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood, Shabana Mahmood, has taken on Ms Rayner's other former role as campaign coordinator.She told BBC Breakfast the party had to \\\"immerse ourselves in the communities that we currently represent - and that we want to represent once again - and to earn their trust\\\">But Ms Rayner remains deputy leader of the party as it is an elected post voted for by members - and will be given additional duties to focus on the future of work and \\\"levelling up\\\".Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbot hit out at the \\\"drawn-out\\\" reshuffle, which she said \\\"hasn't been fantastically successful\\\".Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said Ms Rayner's removal from her campaign role was a sign Sir Keir was trying to make her \\\"carry the can for the poor results\\\".And Labour's Liverpool Riverside MP Kim Johnson called the decision a \\\"despicable act of cowardice\\\" from the Labour leader.An ally of Ms Rayner said she had come out \\\"significantly more powerful, both in terms of the party and policy\\\", while a Labour insider told the BBC: \\\"Who would want to be national campaign coordinator in name only with no power when you're just made the scapegoat for the failures of Keir's team?\\\"In response to the change in role, Ms Rayner tweeted: \\\"I will work tirelessly to reform our party and deliver a policy agenda that will enable us to reconnect with the voters that we need to win, especially in our traditional heartlands, and show that the Labour Party speaks for the working class.\\\"She also thanked \\\"friends from all across the Labour Party and our movement\\\" who had contacted her over the weekend, adding: \\\"United we stand, divided we fall.\\\"Sir Keir Starmer's first reshuffle has been a very messy affair.It began badly with a bust up with his deputy, Angela Rayner, who was being moved from one of her roles - in charge of campaigns.Her allies said she was being sacked.

It learns everything from its mother - how to navigate, how to hunt - and that whale is a young whale,\\\" she said.At the scene: BBC reporter Tim MuffettThere is a crowd of around a couple of hundred people here at Teddington Lock. We're about two miles from where the whale was found stranded in Richmond Lock on Sunday.There have been brief glimpses of it, the hope is that it will swim down river. The tide is rising, and when it starts to fall that will help.The RNLI has told me there is only so much it or anyone else can do. They are encouraging onlookers not to get too close to the water's edge.Minke whales are the smallest of the great whales, growing to about 10m (33ft) and can usually be found throughout the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.Their range extends from the ice edge in the Arctic during the summer to near the equator during winter.This one is very, very far from where it should be. The hope is that it will be able to get home.The Port of London Authority, which owns and operates the lock, said the whale had become stranded at about 19:00 BST. After being spotted by Barnes bridge, it became stuck on Richmond Lock's boat rollers.RNLI rescuers arrived at about 21:00 to help the animal, which is approximately 3-4m (10-13ft) long, off the concrete.They were joined by fire crews and marine rescue divers, who tried for several hours to float the whale.The lock is situated between Teddington and Richmond, comprising of three vertical steel gates suspended from a footbridge.Jake Manketo, 20, from Richmond, said: \\\"Everyone here is just hoping they get it out.\\\"We couldn't believe our eyes when we first saw the poor fella, not every day something like this happens in Richmond.\\\"","postDate":"2021-05-10T14:02:47.000Z","title":"River Thames: Rescuers try to save stranded whale for second time -

The whisky industry tied up minimum alcohol pricing legislation in court for five years.If the court ruled in Nicola Sturgeon's favour, that might enable a referendum but it could still face a unionist boycott which would de-legitimise the outcome.If the court ruled in Boris Johnson's favour, that would thwart a referendum because Ms Sturgeon has made clear she would not hold an illegal vote.However, Nicola Sturgeon could argue in those circumstances that the union was being held together by force of law rather than consent which would be a rotten look for the UK.That might lead to a rise in support for independence.The UK government could pass legislation to explicitly prevent Holyrood from having a referendum or to organise its own vote - options that carry similar risks.The UK strategy for the moment seems to be to play for time by arguing that there can be another referendum at some unspecified point in the future but not now.They make the case that it would be irresponsible to have a referendum while we are still in a pandemic.On that point, Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon agree and appear to be in tune with Scottish public opinion.There are other reasons the first minister is not in a rush. She wants to win a referendum and so would prefer to see support for independence running higher.Polls suggested there was a sustained majority for a \\\"yes\\\" vote throughout much of last year but that has dipped in recent months. The country appears split down the middle.It also became clear during the election that the Scottish government needs time to work out detailed plans for what independence would mean for trade and borders in the aftermath of Brexit.In short, they are not ready to fight a referendum however desperate some in the independence movement are for it to happen.Nicola Sturgeon has told Boris Johnson she considers indyref2 a matter of \\\"when - not if\\\". Officially she still favours having the vote by the end of 2023.'No immediate effort'There is unlikely to be any immediate effort by the Scottish government to begin preparations. The SNP is likely to start working on refreshing the independence case before civil servants are given instructions.As Holyrood returns to business, expect to see the SNP and Greens demonstrate the majority they now have for indyref2 in a symbolic way at an early stage.With 64 SNP votes and eight from the Greens, support for independence is as high as it has ever been in the 129-seat parliament, matching the \\\"yes\\\" majority after the 2011 election.The two parties made explicit commitments to hold a referendum in their election manifestos. The two parties have more votes and seats than before.That is their mandate for indyref2. By contrast, pro-UK parties got 51% of the constituency vote in this election which they take as a mandate to oppose it.Any referendum legislation would need to be certified as within Holyrood's powers by Scotland's top law officer, the lord advocate, and parliament's presiding officer who is elected on Thursday.The choice of a new minister for the constitution and external affairs to replace Mike Russell will also be significant when the first minister gets round to a reshuffle.Her immediate priority is a review of Covid rules to be announced on Tuesday.The election result means there will be a big wrangle over indyref2 in the next few years. It could be resolved through negotiation and agreement or a showdown in the courts.This constitutional clash is not immediate. The dispute is deferred. Pandemic first will be the mantra on all sides in the period ahead.","postDate":"2021-05-10T10:33:16.000Z","title":"Constitutional clash is coming... but not yet - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-57055968"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/18096\/production\/_118445489_mediaitem118445488.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"Labour's leader at Durham County Council is to step down over \\\"deeply disappointing\\\" election results, which saw the party lose overall control.Simon Henig, who has held the post since 2008, saw Labour lose control of the council for the first time in a century, with 21 seats lost.The party has 53 of the authority's 126 councillors - 11 short of a majority.Mr Henig, who remains a councillor, said having reflected on the results he would resign as group leader.He will not put his name forward when the group holds its annual general meeting at the weekend.\\\"I am very proud of the Labour county council's record over the past 12 years, with the creation of over 10,000 new jobs prior to coronavirus, including major companies such as Hitachi choosing to locate in County Durham, plans for 30,000 more jobs now being realised, a world-class events programme and visitor numbers increasing year by year.\\\"This is a wonderful county and I believe this legacy is a firm foundation for continued growth across County Durham in the future.\\\"With the council now under no overall control, BBC Look North political editor Richard Moss said Labour clearly needed to do a deal with one of the other parties.The election saw independents and smaller parties take 31 seats, a collective gain of three.The Conservatives secured 24 seats, a gain of 14, with the Liberal Democrats taking a total of 17 across the county, up three.Overall turnout was 36.35%, up from 31.25% in 2017, the council said.The final results were not announced until late on Saturday after votes for the Durham Police and Crime Commissioner had to be counted twice because \\\"discrepancies\\\" were found in the first batch of ballot papers tallied.Labour's Joy Allen eventually claimed victory with 80,510 votes, just over 3,000 ahead of Conservative challenger George Jabbour on 77,352.Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Professor Sir John Curtice says: \\\"These local elections appear to confirm that the Greens are now able to win a non-trivial proportion of the vote.\\\"Which council areas changed hands?But is this any more than the ebb and flow of election cycles? Or is it indicative of some sort of trend?In a typically pugnacious post on social media, former Green MEP Molly Scott Cato said: \\\"The way broadcasters are almost entirely ignoring the frankly astonishing gains by the Green Party is the best indicator to those who want real change and to challenge the establishment that they should always vote Green.\\\"'Disillusionment with Labour'I called her with a mild sense of trepidation (incidentally, Jonathan Bartley had been on Newsnight and Sian Berry talked to Huw Edwards on the BBC's election special, but we'll let that go).The Green Party's performance at this set of elections was down to three factors, Ms Scott Cato told me.\\\"People are facing up to the climate crisis, which we've been thinking about for decades,\\\" she said.There was also \\\"disillusionment with Labour\\\" and, finally, \\\"the shoe leather thing\\\", as she put it.\\\"You do find people who say they are Green voters. But you don't find anyone who says, 'My granddad voted Green.'\\\"In other words, if there is any tradition to voting Green, it doesn't run very deep.The party has to scrap and harry for every single vote.Ms Scott Cato reckons that makes the Greens distinctive, where others may be more complacent about at least something of a core vote.Let's dig a little deeper.Who is voting Green, and where? And how much of this points to evidence of a splintering on the Left, where, in very broad terms, Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP and the Greens are all chasing voters who lean in that direction, leaving the Conservatives with a near monopoly for those who lean to the Right?\\\"The party's performance overlapped with Labour's, with the strongest Green showings in areas with the most graduates and professionals,\\\" writes Professor Rob Ford of Manchester University in the Observer.Treading water?Professor Matthew Goodwin, of the University of Kent, takes the argument further in The Sunday Times.\\\"The quietly impressive performance by the Greens this week is a big hint that we may well be heading in the same direction as our European neighbours, such as Germany, where cosmopolitan parties are eclipsing the old centre-left.\\\"He adds: \\\"Fast forward 10 years and I'd not be surprised to see the Greens or the Lib Dems as a much bigger force, rallying zoomer graduates, middle-class professionals and city-dwellers in the face of a Labour Party that looks bewildered and lost.\\\"Plenty of parties have been assumed by some to be on the brink of death, only to revive themselves.George Dangerfield wrote a book called The Strange Death of Liberal England, in 1935.Geoffrey Wheatcroft wrote a book called The Strange Death of Tory England, in 2005.Others have been talked up, as the Greens have before, only to tread water or shrivel.Predicting what might happen in politics is a brave game, which is what makes it so fascinating to observe.The Green Party of England and Wales remains a tiddler, but there is evidence it is growing, and growing in confidence.","postDate":"2021-05-09T15:04:05.000Z","title":"Analysis: Is the Green Party on the rise - and if so, why? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-politics-57048811"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/CF70\/production\/_118440135_hi067189157.jpg","author":"Laura Kuenssberg","description":"Was it worth it?Reshuffles are moments when leaders have a chance to assert their authority - to show they are in charge.Even the most ardent political obsessive would acknowledge (probably) that opposition reshuffles are not necessarily noticed by the public.But they matter to the mood and atmosphere of parties and Parliament.And for a party to win favour with voters over time, it needs to show the public trusted and favourite faces, to give the impression of an organisation ready for government - a group of people who we can all imagine in charge.Sir Keir Starmer's first reshuffle, however, has been a very messy affair.It began badly with a bust up with his deputy, Angela Rayner, who was being moved from one of her roles - in charge of campaigns.Her allies said she was being sacked. Sir Keir's team said she was being moved. They can't both be telling the whole truth.But there was a late night howl of backlash to the notion she was being ousted, putting pressure on the leader to find a way to make her stay.'No mood to compromise'It took all day for the two to agree. That may seem astounding given that Sir Keir is meant to be the boss.Remember, however, that Ms Rayner's position as deputy leader is an elected one, and even the suggestion of her losing part of her role had already provoked outrage.Clearly, she was in no mood to compromise.Whether it was settled in the end by an arm wrestle, a staring match, or screaming and shouting, the length of time it took created a massive vacuum - which Sir Keir's critics on the left of the party filled, almost with glee, to push him for a change in direction.And even some of his backers felt anxious, cross about the delays, concerned about the competence of the so called \\\"brains trust\\\" - a nickname for his team of advisers, not always used in a very complimentary way.After a day of dispute and delay, in the end, the list emerged.Some important changes, but not a sweeping recasting of the team - you can read about the changes here.Ms Rayner did stay in the end, with a prominent job, and - according to her allies - a newfound confidence.Within minutes, they were briefing that her power has been boosted, implying she was the victor in the stand-off with the boss.One of her supporters said: \\\"On Friday Keir couldn't answer a simple question about what Labour's vision is, what our offer is and how we will win back the voters in our heartland seats.\\\"Angela can answer that question and is the best person to lead the fight back in the Red Wall.\\\"'Political test'Although an accommodation of sorts has been reached over her job, it doesn't seem like the two have reached a truce.It's easy for moments like these to be overplayed as seismic and massively significant, when in a few months, the mood calms, events fade.But these last few days have been an important political test for the Labour leader.In a statement, Sir Keir said: \\\"The Labour Party must be the party that embraces the demand for change across our country. That will require bold ideas and a relentless focus on the priorities of the British people.\\\"Just as the pandemic has changed what is possible and what is necessary, so Labour must change too.\\\"The election results were expected to be grim, but the handling of the reshuffle was a mess that could have been avoided - and a knock to his authority he didn't need.","postDate":"2021-05-09T22:46:06.000Z","title":"Labour: Messy reshuffle knocks Sir Keir Starmer's authority - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-politics-57052502"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/ADC2\/production\/_117828444_gettyimages-1149030074-1.jpg","author":"By Lucy Hooker","description":"For over a year anyone who has been able to, has been asked to do their job from home. And for many that has meant a whole catalogue of challenges from fitting work around home schooling to shooing the cat off your keyboard.While there was money to be saved on bus fares, the heating bill has gone up.And while the pressure was off to wash your hair, it's been lonely at times too.So with many offices now gradually inviting staff back, we wanted to know how people are feeling about the return.'It's been great to wear trousers again'Ashley Wright has just had his first proper day back in the office for over a year.\\\"The biggest buzz was getting up knowing you were going to leave the house,\\\" he says.He works on the sales team at a firm making alarm systems at Crowborough, East Sussex. While the production team has been in, he's worked from home for a year and has had enough.\\\"I kept pestering and pestering,\\\" he says. Eventually, even though the rest of his team is still working from home, they let him back,He spent so much time in his pyjamas over the last year, once he accidentally went to Tesco's wearing them. Now he's happy just to be putting on proper trousers and shoes again.Getting on the (still empty) train and walking back into a building full of colleagues was \\\"uplifting\\\" he says. Better still, he now gets to leave his laptop at the office, so work doesn't take over every waking hour.\\\"For the last year and a bit I have basically done everything from my house so no, I won't miss working from home.\\\"'I feel empowered working from home'\\\"I found the home environment gave me a real possibility to reflect on things in peace,\\\" says Ingrid Temmerman.She has a job she enjoys in the higher education sector but she doesn't want to go back to nine-to-five, five days a week in the office with an hour-and-a-half commute each way on a crowded train that costs over £2,000 a year.But the main thing is her mental health.\\\"I feel [this last year] has given me a new lease of life. I'm thinking now I understand fragility of life and of mental health.\\\"Working from home has given her a new sense of empowerment which she doesn't want to lose.\\\"I can make the separation between work and home life. I know other people struggle with that, but it was easier for me. I was just happier and my work level went up: the quality and productivity.\\\"Nor does she miss the \\\"he said, she said\\\" of office politics.\\\"When you're on a Zoom call it's more streamlined.\\\"But her manager wants her back in the office. So she's trying to negotiate a hybrid arrangement with the majority of time at home.'You start work before breakfast'Omar, 35, is delighted to be back in the office. He works for one of the big American banks based in London's Canary Wharf financial district.\\\"Personally I prefer going to the office,\\\" he says. \\\"I like a nice cup of coffee, going to a café, getting a good lunch.\\\"The floor he works on is still pretty empty. But around Canary Wharf people are starting to trickle back, queuing for bars and restaurants, going to the gym.Omar says no-one he knows believes they can be as productive working from home as they can in the office where they have access to big screens, technology and interacting with colleagues.And at home he found work takes over your life.\\\"You're on your laptop before breakfast,\\\" he says. \\\"When you're in the office there's the journey in, buying a coffee, chatting to a colleague and sitting down at your desk at 8.30 or 9am.\\\"\\\"When you're at you're at home, you're stuck in your home environment, you're too comfortable.\\\"\\\"After work, when you're finished, you feel more energetic. It's easier to go out and have social life, a drink.\\\"'I just can't resist the biscuit barrel'For Alexander Holland, one of the worst things about working from home was when new people moved in next door and began renovating. They seemed to be drilling from 7am to 9pm.He was also taken aback to find providing his five-year-old with a desk and a tablet wasn't enough to guarantee he'd sit quietly and do four hours of school work.\\\"After five minutes he popped out saying 'I don't want to do it',\\\" says Alex, laughing at his own naivety.And like many of us, the computer chip designer from Oxford has gone a bit stir-crazy with no adults to talk to.But probably the toughest challenge was the proximity of the biscuit tin.\\\"Working from home for over a year, at a desk only a few meters away from the TV and the kitchen, with very little natural self-control hasn't been good for my waistline or my time management,\\\" he says.Now he's glumly facing up to the weight he's put on.While others seem to have flourished working from home, he feels he lacks the self-discipline required. It's not just food, he can get distracted by cleaning the dirty kitchen, putting on a load of washing, or the telly.\\\"Other times its half past midnight and I'm still on the computer.\\\"As soon as he's allowed, he's heading back to the office.'For people like me with a disability, working from home is a huge benefit'For Nazneen Tahira, the switch to working from home has been a godsend. She has a disability that means she doesn't see well when the light is dim.\\\"In my house I know where everything is. In the outside environment it's hard for me to navigate. I tend to not go out or I fall down,\\\" she says.In winter she used to have to leave work early or ask her husband to pick her up from her office in the centre of Birmingham.In the past her employers haven't been willing to consider working from home but the pandemic has shifted attitudes.\\\"I hope it would be different now,\\\" she says. \\\"I've been working for the last year perfectly fine - as everyone else has - from home\\\".\\\"For people in a situation like myself with a disability, it's going to be helpful - we can still carry on working. I think it will be a huge benefit.\\\"There are plenty of other advantages she points out, you save money on the commute and on lunches.\\\"I suppose there's the people I worked with, the banter, I think I'd miss that face-to-face interaction with supervisors and superiors, but you can get that over Zoom and Teams,\\\" she says.","postDate":"2021-05-10T00:54:55.000Z","title":"Office or home?

We may spend election night in 2026 talking about Eastwood, Aberdeenshire West and Dumbarton all over again.The difference is that after 2016, nine of the 10 most marginal seats were SNP targets. Now, only three are - and they are defending the other seven.It may seem an obvious point given they now hold the lion's share of constituencies, but there are fewer easy targets for Nicola Sturgeon's party in future - and far more wobbly seats to defend, including the country's most marginal in Ayr which they won by just 170 votes.As previously, these close contests are mostly SNP-Conservative affairs. Labour was not in second place in a single constituency with a single-digit majority before the election, and they only have one now - East Lothian, the seat they lost to the SNP.This means there is little in the way of obvious target seats for Anas Sarwar to start building towards challenging in 2026.Safe seatsOne striking change between the 2016 and 2021 results was that in Shetland - which has gone from the safest seat in Scotland, with a 44.3% majority to the ninth most marginal, with a cushion of just 6.8%.These figures exclude the fact there was a by-election midway through the term, but it is still a big shift in a Lib Dem stronghold.The safest seat now belongs to Shona Robison in Dundee City East with a 41.4% majority - with her Dundee City West neighbour Joe Fitzpatrick in second spot on 40.2%.Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has also constructed something of a fortress in Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, with the biggest majority in terms of raw votes - 15,861 of them.Perhaps the rise of tactical voting in this election means we need a new way to talk about \\\"safe\\\" seats, though. Contests have increasingly become a race between the SNP and whichever other party is best placed locally to challenge them.On that front, there were 29 seats where the SNP won more than 50% of the vote - so much that even if the opposition clubbed together and backed one candidate, they would still not win.The Conservatives only had one seat with a margin this wide - Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire - and Labour had none.Oddly though, the smallest party, the Lib Dems, had three. And their fourth seat was not far behind, on 48.6%. They seem to have become the party of extremes, because they also lost their deposit in 50 of the 73 constituencies, by polling under 5% of the vote.Smaller partiesWhile nothing much has changed in the makeup of the parliament, the existing parties rather entrenched their positions.There was a lot of talk of smaller parties during the campaign, with Alex Salmond launching the Alba Party to great fanfare, but ultimately they barely made a dent in the figures with 1.7% of the regional ballot.George Galloway's All for Unity group similarly flopped, managing 0.9% of the vote.And UKIP - now dedicated to shutting down Holyrood - secured just 3,848 list votes, 0.1% of the 2.7m cast around Scotland - and behind the rather more bluntly-titled Abolish the Scottish Parliament Party on 0.3%.TurnoutOne of the big stories across Scotland was how many people came out to vote.Turnout hit a record high for a Holyrood election, at 63.2%. It was up in every single constituency, and indeed at least half of the registered electorate took part in every seat.It was over 60% in 54 of the 73 constituencies, and over 70% in four.The overall figure is ten points up on the average of the five previous Holyrood elections, and well in advance of the previous high of 59% in 1999.However it still lags behind the levels recorded in recent general elections north of the border - turnout was 68.1% for the Westminster election in December 2019 - and a good way off the massive engagement in the 2014 referendum, which was 84.6%.","postDate":"2021-05-10T08:38:21.000Z","title":"Scottish election 2021: The numbers behind the result - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-57047907"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/A216\/production\/_118449414_02d4bcb6-2727-4f48-a3f2-4f7a9c61e823.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"Outgoing Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken has said the party is \\\"not breaking through\\\" and that a change of leadership is needed.At a press conference on Monday at Stormont, Mr Aiken said the party had \\\"not been working as well as it should be\\\".On Saturday, Mr Aiken announced he was stepping down.A virtual meeting of the party's ruling executive will be held on Tuesday night to discuss the leadership process.The South Antrim assembly member has been in charge since November 2019.Mr Aiken said unionism needs to \\\"get its act together\\\" and there is now a time for reflection.Mr Aiken will remain in charge temporarily until his successor is found.Mr Aiken said the UUP continues to do what is right not only for unionists but for all in Northern Ireland.He said it was a \\\"bittersweet moment\\\".\\\"I am, however, self-aware enough to realise that our party, despite our strengths, is not breaking through,\\\" he said.\\\"I am also very aware of my limitations.

That was the fourth PFD sent to the DWP by coroners since 2013.In response, the department said it would give all of its call handlers training in mental health and introduce a tracking system to identify vulnerable people across its systems. Earlier internal reviews had established the inability to identify a vulnerable claimant as a problem.Philippa's sister Imogen told the BBC her family had now begun a legal claim against the DWP and Capita including a claim under the Human Rights Act for violation of the right to life over their handling of the case.Imogen said: \\\"We were incredibly close. In her eulogy at her funeral I described her as my soulmate. I spoke to her [Philippa] almost daily about it [her benefit claim].\\\"She talked about how it disempowered her and made her feel inhuman.\\\"It was like watching a car crash in slow motion... we helped her emotionally, financially and practically and we could see the tragedy in front of us but couldn't do anything more to stop it.\\\"Errol Graham starved to death in 2018 while seriously mentally ill. His benefits were stopped when he failed to attend a work capability assessment and did not respond to calls, letters or home visits from the DWP.When his body was found, Mr Graham weighed four-and-a-half stone (30kg) and his family said he had used pliers to pull out his teeth.His family submitted an application for permission to go to the Court of Appeal in April, after losing a judicial review against the DWP's safeguarding policy.Leigh Day, the family's solicitors, had argued the government guidance failed to impose a duty of care on decision-makers to investigate when mentally-ill claimants did not engage with the system.Alison Turner, fiancée of Mr Graham's son, said: \\\"I want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else. It's got to stop. They are not just damaging one person, there's a ripple effect on families.\\\"Jodey Whiting, 42, took her own life after her benefits were stopped.Her family are due to attend the High Court on 22 June to argue she should have a second inquest to consider the DWP's role in her 2017 death.Ms Whiting's mother, Joy Dove, of Norton, Stockton-on-Tees, won permission to request the new inquest. New evidence was submitted including an independent inquiry's conclusions that mistakes were made by the DWP.The family received a letter endorsing the decision Ms Whiting's benefits should be stopped and saying she was fit to work while she was in a mortuary ahead of her burial, her mother said.Following her death, one of Jodey Whiting's twins Cory Bell died at the age of 19 from a drug overdose.\\\"We've had that second death in the family and I blame the DWP too,\\\" Ms Dove said, describing him as a \\\"lost soul\\\".The DWP said its condolences were with the families.Analysis: Michael Buchanan, social affairs correspondentIt's been 11 years since the government was first made aware there was a problem with the tests it used to assess benefit claims after a coroner wrote to the DWP following the suicide of a man.During all that time, the government has simply marked its own homework, doing internal reviews.In a clear sign that these assessments are of limited use, in Scotland from next year, claimants for the main disability benefit will only have to undergo a test if any doubts remain about their claim following a review of their medical records.For the vast majority of people, the expectation is that they won't have to undergo a test - removing from the process what has long been a source of extreme stress for many people.'Tip of the iceberg'In 2012, internal reviews by the DWP took the form of so-called \\\"peer reviews\\\" and the DWP carried out 49 of them into deaths and 11 into further serious incidents between February 2012 and November 2014, according to the Disability News Service.Since 2015, the DWP has held so-called \\\"internal process reviews\\\" instead. In July 2019 Justin Tomlinson MP, Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work said there had been 84 held since 2015 and a further six would be \\\"conducted shortly\\\".Separately, the BBC has collated press reports naming 82 individuals to have died after some alleged DWP activity such as termination of benefits. Mental health vulnerabilities were a contributing factor in 35 of those people's deaths.The reviews are not routinely published and bereaved families are not routinely informed when they begin.Ms Abrahams, the MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, said she thought the known cases were \\\"the tip of the iceberg\\\".She said: \\\"That there has been such a lack of openness and transparency to enable us to properly examine reports on all deaths is a disgrace.\\\"Ken Butler, welfare rights adviser at the charity Disability Rights UK, said people had their benefits cut and suffered \\\"fear and anxiety\\\" due to \\\"poor and inaccurate medical assessments\\\" carried out on behalf of the DWP by the private contractors Capita, the Independent Assessment Services (formerly called Atos) and Maximus.The DWP maintains its disability assessors are \\\"all trained and qualified health professionals... with significant experience\\\" and their work is \\\"subject to stringent ongoing quality monitoring\\\".'Devastating consequences'Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Thérèse Coffey told the Work and Pensions Committee in February the DWP \\\"did not have a duty of care or statutory safeguarding duty\\\".Tessa Gregory, partner at Leigh Day solicitors, said there was a \\\"dissonance\\\" between the DWP's legal stance and its role in providing the sole income for vulnerable people.\\\"There seems to be a real issue with the DWP failing to make reasonable adjustments for claimants who due to their mental health issues struggle with responding to official letters or participating in assessments,\\\" she said.\\\"When DWP decision making goes wrong it can, as we have seen in far too many cases, have devastating and sometimes fatal consequences... the case for reform is clear.\\\"The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has meanwhile backtracked on assurances it previously gave to Ms Abrahams' MP it would conduct an inquiry into the WCA process and Personal Independence Payment (PIP) benefit for disabled claimants.As yet it has also ruled out reviewing deaths allegedly linked to some DWP activity such as termination of benefits or following DWP sanctions, which Ms Abrahams said was \\\"very disappointing\\\".In a statement, the commission said the \\\"landscape had changed considerably in the past year\\\".\\\"We and others have undertaken relevant work in this area and it is too early to say whether an inquiry would be the best approach on this issue,\\\" it added.The DWP said: \\\"We support millions of people a year and our priority is they get the benefits to which they are entitled promptly and receive a supportive and compassionate service.\\\"In the vast majority of cases, this happens, but when, sadly, there is a tragic case we take it very seriously.\\\"In those circumstances, it's absolutely right we carry out an internal review to check if the correct processes were followed and identify any lessons learned to inform future policy and service.\\\"More about this storyThe Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.For more information on methodology, click here.

But those that do will have \\\"the ability to take down any listings from the marketplace themselves\\\", the company said.More than 50 authorities around the world are already involved in the early stages of the project, it added.Harmful productsEBay said it already had \\\"extensive\\\" reporting systems for customers to use and took \\\"pro-active\\\" steps to remove banned items.But \\\"eliminating the need for a second level of approval streamlines the process, making product removal more efficient and reducing the risk of harmful products being purchased,\\\" it said.Lesley Rudd, chief executive of Electrical Safety First, said: \\\"We welcome any move that speeds up the process of removing dangerous goods online\\\".\\\"Our investigations have continuously found dangerous, unbranded electrical goods with obvious visual defects for sale to UK consumers. These products often lack some of the most basic safety features.\\\"But she added that more work needs to be done to stop such products going on sale in the first place.\\\"Online marketplaces must be legally recognised as a retailer in order to sufficiently tackle the issue of dangerous goods sold via their sites and we urge the government to include these sites in their forthcoming Online Safety Bill,\\\" she said.One group involved in eBay's new system is Westminster Council. Councillor Heather Acton said the past year had seen a huge increase in shopping online - and scams and fraud were a concern.The new tools mean \\\"our trading standards teams have been able to expedite our processes and ensure that our local communities can continue to be safe\\\", she said.Another body with access is Ofcom, which among other roles regulates the radio waves used for broadcast and wireless signals. Certain types of wireless radio kit are tightly regulated - so that they cannot interfere with protected signals - and it plans to use the new tools to remove such items from sale.Murray Lambell, eBay's UK manager, said the pandemic had led online shopping to become \\\"an even greater part of everyone's lives\\\".\\\"Market places should be taking their responsibility for consumer safety seriously, but collaboration with authorities is vital,\\\" he said.\\\"We hope that other players in the industry will follow suit,\\\" he added.","postDate":"2021-05-10T01:48:05.000Z","title":"Dangerous eBay listings can be removed by regulators - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-57021383"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/1740\/production\/_118425950_portugal.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"The travel industry has expressed disappointment that so few countries are on the UK government's green list for travel, describing the announcement as \\\"overly cautious\\\".The traffic light system means travel abroad from 17 May will not be illegal.The 12 green list countries, which include Portugal, Gibraltar and Israel, will not require people to quarantine on return to England.Firms said leaving the US off the list would risk the UK \\\"falling behind\\\".Travel to amber or red lists countries is not advised.The change in travel rules applies to England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not said when they might ease their strict travel rules.Only four of the countries on the green list are in Europe, and Portugal is the only large holiday destination from the continent on the list.Israel and Singapore are also included, but Australia and New Zealand - which are approved as safe by the UK government - are not currently allowing in visitors from abroad.France, Greece, Italy and Spain, normally hugely popular holiday destinations for UK travellers, are not included on the safe list.Andrew Flintham, managing director of holiday firm TUI, said: \\\"While we were expecting to see just a handful of destinations on the green list, this is an overly cautious start.\\\"Airlines UK, representing UK carriers, described it as \\\"a missed opportunity\\\" and \\\"a reopening of air travel in name only\\\" which left the UK \\\"at risk of falling behind\\\".And Easyjet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: \\\"The decision to put so few European countries into the green tier is simply not justified by the data or the science, and is inconsistent with the approach to reopen the domestic economy.\\\"UK citizens risked missing out on bookings for hotels if other European tourists were permitted to travel, he added.Making the announcement, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the easing of restrictions was \\\"necessarily cautious\\\" in the light of the threat from new variants of Covid-19.He said the UK's success in combating the virus was not matched in many other countries.However he said the list would be reviewed every three weeks by the Joint Biosecurity Centre - the team set up last year to monitor the threat from the virus.Some firms had hoped the rapid roll out of the vaccination programme in the US would allow summer travel to resume there more quickly.\\\"There is no reason for the US to be absent from the green list.

These include Adele, Chris Rock, Ringo Starr, and Will Ferrell.\\\"I don't always have a lot of intonation or variation in how I speak... which I'm told makes for great comedy,\\\" he joked in his opening monologue. \\\"I'm actually making history tonight as the first person with Asperger's to host SNL.\\\"His comment prompted a round of applause from the studio audience.Some people on social media, however, questioned his claim. They pointed out that the comedian Dan Aykroyd, who has spoken publicly about his experience with Tourette's and Asperger's syndrome, has previously hosted SNL.Mr Musk, who has more than 53 million followers on Twitter, also joked about his use of social media. He has faced criticism and even legal threats over his tweets in the past.\\\"Look, I know I sometimes say or post strange things, but that's just how my brain works,\\\" he said.\\\"To anyone who's been offended, I just want to say I reinvented electric cars, and I'm sending people to Mars in a rocket ship.

It said people can toggle to the \\\"friends and family\\\" option during payment to avoid the issue.The tip jar function also has support for Bandcamp - widely used by musicians - and Patreon, used by all sorts of independent digital creators such as YouTubers and podcasters.Twitter says the addition was inspired by people who added payment links or Patreon ads in replies to viral tweets.\\\"We $ee you - sharing your PayPal link after your Tweet goes viral, adding your $Cashtag to your profile so people can support your work, dropping your Venmo handle on your birthday or if you just need some extra help,\\\" wrote Twitter's senior product manager Esther Crawford in the blog post announcing the feature.It said more people would be able to add the function to their profile \\\"soon\\\".But there are some concerns about the way the function will be used.Journalists, in particular, are often banned from accepting gifts - and it's not clear how \\\"tips\\\" will be treated by news organisations.\\\"Seems like Twitter's tip jar feature is going to raise some issues for newsrooms,\\\" tweeted Ryan Lizza, Politico's Washington correspondent.\\\"Should reporters at your favourite [publications] and networks be allowed to accept money from anyone on the internet?\\\" he asked.Another reporter writing for a US-based newspaper wrote: \\\"On the one hand... seems ripe for creating unethical situations.\\\"On the other hand...

The massive economic recovery that many were expecting in America did not materialise in this latest jobs report.The US economy added only 266,000 jobs in April, a far cry from estimates that ranged anywhere from 900,000 jobs to possibly even 2 million.This discouraging employment report comes as coronavirus infection rates are declining and businesses are reopening.Unsurprisingly, many of the gains came in the leisure and hospitality sectors as bars and restaurants reopened. But it is other sectors such as retail where hiring is stagnant.Some economists had warned of a fitful economic recovery.One disappointing jobs report does not mean the country's economy is in trouble.But this is evidence it may take a lot longer for the US to make its economic comeback.The slowdown in hiring was \\\"very probably\\\" not a result of weaker demand for workers, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\\\"We know from endless surveys that labour demand is very strong, but we also know from both surveys and media-reported anecdotes that firms are finding it hard to recruit people,\\\" he said.He said that the data \\\"made it much easier\\\" to argue that putting up unemployment benefits by $300 a week in the March relief bill had \\\"crimped labour supply\\\".Some states agree with that argument. Both South Carolina and Montana have said they will stop unemployment benefits offered by the federal government from being paid to their citizens.They are worried that the extra money is more likely to persuade people to stay at home, keeping them out of the workforce. Instead, Montana is offering $1,200 to those who return to work.","postDate":"2021-05-07T16:34:10.000Z","title":"US jobs figures fall far short of expectations - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-57024555"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/1343F\/production\/_118411987_chinaexports.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"China's exports unexpectedly surged last month as America's speedy recovery from the pandemic spurred demand.Stalled factory production in India, as the country struggles with a coronavirus crisis, also helped boost the global market for Chinese goods.China's exports in dollar terms surged by more than 32% from a year earlier to almost $264bn (£190bn).In the same month imports grew at the fastest pace in more than a decade, rising by 43% from a year ago.Despite ongoing trade tensions with the US and other countries, China's exports for the month were almost $43bn more than its imports, a more than threefold increase.Economists highlight that the figures are heavily skewed as they are compared to the period a year ago when the country was brought to a virtual standstill by strict lockdown measures.But the recovery of the world's second largest economy still faces some major challenges.Analysts expect China's gross domestic product growth to slow from the record 18.3% expansion in the January-March quarter.That comes as the Covid-19 pandemic disrupts supply chains around the world, slowing the movement of goods and pushing up the cost of shipping.The global shortage of microchips, which are used in everything from cars to phones, is also hurting manufacturers.Last week, China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index showed that factory activity growth slowed in April from the previous month.On Thursday, China \\\"indefinitely\\\" suspended key economic dialogue with Australia, the latest in a growing diplomatic rift between the countries.Relations have declined since Australia called for a probe into the origins of Covid-19 and banned Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from building its 5G network.Last year, China imposed sanctions on Australian goods such as wine and beef.In a statement, a Chinese government commission accused Australia of having a \\\"Cold War mindset\\\".","postDate":"2021-05-07T06:32:58.000Z","title":"China's exports soar as US recovers and India stalls - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-57019218"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/B27B\/production\/_118319654_riut_mcr_0177.jpg","author":"By Nell Mackenzie","description":"When Dr Fransisco Velasco started work on a Covid ward, he found himself commuting to work with his laptop and notes in a bin bag.His brand new rucksack was made of canvas and could not be sterilised at the end of each day.The doctor, based in Mexico, decided to contact the British company behind the bag and tell them about the problem. His girlfriend told him not to bother, as they probably wouldn't care. Undeterred, Dr Velasco wrote a lengthy message.Sarah Giblin, the owner and designer of RiutBag, responded immediately.She told him: \\\"I'm the designer, and I am so heartbroken you can't use your backpack. Please give me half an hour of your time to tell me what you need.\\\"Dr Velasco spoke of the difficulties of his job, sharing details he had kept from his family, not wishing to worry them.\\\"He needed a stranger to listen,\\\" says Sarah, who was contending with worries of her own.Sarah's bag company is a microbusiness that she runs herself from Manchester. She keeps in touch with a loyal customer base through social media and runs Kickstarter campaigns to fund her new designs.But when the pandemic struck, with no way to travel for fun or commute to work, people had stopped buying bags and Riutbag was struggling.However, after speaking to Dr Velasco, Sarah hunkered down with her sketchpad to design a rucksack that could be sterilised.After researching ambulance bags and speaking to first responders, she chose a material similar to tarpaulin, found on lorries. On the sides of the bag, she added mask and hand sanitiser holders.And there it was: RiutBag's first Covid-era product line.Sarah isn't alone in having found inspiration in adversity.Lockdowns have presented unique opportunities and challenges for many product designers and inventors.More Technology of BusinessMade in Britain, a non-profit organisation representing the UK's smaller manufacturers, told the BBC its membership jumped 130% this year compared with before the lockdown.By March 2021, the number of patent applications registered with the UK Intellectual Property Office increased by 6% from the previous year to 4,295.Time to reflect, changing job circumstances and anticipation of new products consumers may want to buy after lockdown have proved a fertile ground for British inventors.But like many product designers working during Covid, Sarah has also faced new administrative challenges.For the last seven years, she has travelled with her designs to the warehouse she works with in south China. Normally she's there at the end of production to make sure that every bag has the right fit, sturdiness of the zips, and matching seams.Now, stuck in her Manchester studio, Sarah was unable to give her merchandise the in-person inspection.\\\"My production manager in China is my eyes and ears when I'm not there and we really trust each other,\\\" says Sarah.After seven product attempts, or prototypes, the warehouse made the newest version of a RiutBag. Dr Velasco gave feedback on each of the samples. And the laptop backpack was released to the market in April.\\\"I could have kept designing that bag for the next 10 years, but we called time,\\\" she says.Tom Pellereau won the BBC show The Apprentice in 2011. He agrees with Sarah's sentiment: the hardest part of inventing is deciding when to stop fiddling and start selling.\\\"I'm never happy to bring a product to the market until I know it's fantastic,\\\" he says.Luckily, Lord Sugar, who is a director at Tom's company STYLIDEAS, helps push his products to market.\\\"He's quite terrifying and also he really knows what he is talking about,\\\" Tom says.This autumn Tom will release a new product to follow up his make-up brush cleaner. His invention, which took four years to develop, is currently confidential and the details of its release will be announced soon.At one point, he ordered plumbing parts off the internet and cut them to size to improve a part of one of his cosmetic inventions. He admits that his house has cupboards full of make-up brushes and beauty tools.The most important piece of advice he offers to inventors is to ask for feedback.\\\"You really have got to listen to what people think, otherwise you don't actually know if you've got something that people would be interested in buying.\\\"Another piece of advice from Tom: don't quit your day job. It can take a product 10 years to come to market and make money. During that time, inventors need to plan on how they will stay afloat financially.\\\"You need to try to be in the game for as long as you can,\\\" he says.Tom moved back in with his parents for five years while he developed the curvy nail file that made him famous.He remembers how fellow engineering grads had taken up jobs with investment banks, bought houses and went on lovely holidays.\\\"And I was living with my parents and seeing their photos on Facebook.\\\"One technology that might have hastened Tom's journey, had it been available when he was starting out and developing product prototypes, is 3D printing.When inspiration struck John Docherty, it cost him just £70 to send his designs to Torus Technology, a company near his home in Shropshire.The boxing and martial arts teacher had learned from his sensei that if he needed to throw a punch, it was good form to wrap his hand round an object of some sort, rather than use a tightly clenched fist.Boxing gloves typically feature a bit of foam that performs this purpose. But after 30 years of combat and countless injuries to his hands and wrists, John started to question whether the design might be improved.Then, when lockdowns hit, he was furloughed.\\\"I was at home with my partner and my little boy. There was a fun atmosphere that felt creative. And I suddenly had time to focus on this little invention,\\\" he says.He drew and got printed a grenade-shaped cone of silicone rubber meant to be stuffed into a boxing glove. It maintains the structural integrity of the hand when it lands a punch.Another local production company called Protolabs agreed to manufacture his Boxing Hand Grenade.John's invention has garnered the attention of professional boxers and influencers on social media.Filippo Di Nardo, considered the Ferrari of boxing glove makers, has agreed an exclusive deal to build John's \\\"grenades\\\" into his gloves.\\\"I pinch myself every day and wonder why nobody else has done this,\\\" says John.","postDate":"2021-05-06T23:20:54.000Z","title":"Taking an invention from idea to the marketplace - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56978157"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/F8CB\/production\/_118319636_chloedigitalnomadwork.jpg","author":"By Suzanne Bearne","description":"Like many people, Chloe Dickenson's travel plans ground to a halt last year when the world was thrown into lockdown.A so-called \\\"digital nomad\\\", the 22-year-old was living and working from her laptop overseas. In March 2020, she was 11 months into a stint across South East Asia and Australia when her and her boyfriend's itinerary had to be shelved.\\\"We were in Vietnam, and our original plan was to continue travelling around Asia,\\\" says the freelance writer and travel blogger. \\\"But once it became clear that this wasn't really a possibility, we booked a flight to Greece for the end of March, with the intention of spending a few months in Greece, Montenegro, Albania and Croatia until the virus 'calmed down'.\\\"However, seeing the pandemic quickly spread, they felt the best plan was to figure out how to return to the UK from Greece. \\\"We were definitely in two minds about what to do, we definitely didn't want to go home just yet, but it seemed like the safest and most logical thing to do at the time,\\\" says Ms Dickenson.So, on 15 March 2020, the couple embarked on a long journey home across Europe. \\\"We travelled across four countries in 66 hours, and it took three planes, four cars and two buses for us to arrive home in the UK at my parents' house in Penrith, Cumbria.\\\"With improved wi-fi and flexible workspaces across the world, digital nomadism has boomed over recent years. And while the global travel restrictions caused by coronavirus have temporarily grounded many such nomads, longer term the movement is expected to grow much further.This is a result of the pandemic making many of us realise that we don't actually need to go into the office. And nor do we want to return to it.Jennifer Nelson, 39, from Miami, has been working remotely since 2016 when she quit her job and left New York. A digital marketing consultant, she had been living in Argentina for four months when worldwide lockdowns started in March 2020.\\\"Argentina closed borders, grounded all flights, and went into lockdown without much warning,\\\" she says. \\\"It was a very scary time as there were a lot of us expats and digital nomads in Argentina wondering what to do.\\\"The US embassy started announcing emergency flights back to the US for those stuck. But those flights at the time were $3,000 (£2,165) plus. So in the end, I decided to stay in Argentina as they announced that they were extending all visas, and ultimately I had no choice since there were no commercial flights out.\\\"Ms Nelson stayed in an Airbnb in Buenos Aires. \\\"I had a community of other expats and Argentines who I was able to talk with,\\\" she says. \\\"We were mostly all in a WhatsApp group sharing quarantine memes. That's how we got by and stayed sane.\\\"By the end of the year she decided to move on to Miami for two months, and then to Hawaii where she currently is.Emmanuel Guisset is the founder and chief executive of co-living space Outsite, which is targeted at digital nomads and has 27 locations worldwide, including in Bali, Costa Rica and Portugal. He says his company felt the pain early last year but has rebounded since.\\\"There were a lot of cancellations and refunds,\\\" he says. \\\"By July we bounced back. In the US people could still travel [domestically] and people wanted to be closer to nature and move to smaller cities.\\\"As such Outsite's locations in Hawaii and on the coast near San Diego in southern California have proven popular. But with the company centred around people sharing facilities in communal areas did that put off people?\\\"Our target market of people in their 30s and 40s don't seem to mind,\\\" says Mr Guisset, a keen surfer who has spent the past year remote working from Hawaii, Mexico, Portugal and California. \\\"And we ask people to wear masks in communal areas.\\\"He adds that he is now very hopeful about the future because as a result of the pandemic \\\"remote working is no longer a niche\\\".This is certainly backed up by figures from the US. There were 10.9 million digital nomads in the US by the end of last year, according to a study by business consultancy MBO Partners. This was 49% higher than 7.3 million in 2019.New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.Meanwhile, a number of countries and other territories have launched schemes to attract digital nomads. In July last year the Caribbean island of Barbados announced that such workers could pay $2,000 (£1,444) to live there for one year.Dubai in the United Arab Emirates subsequently launched a similar programme, as did the Cayman Islands and Estonia.Robert Litchfield, co-author of the book Digital Nomads, agrees that the phenomenon \\\"is only going to increase\\\".\\\"I don't think anyone has said, 'I'm done with nomadism [because of the pandemic] and I'm going back to the office cubicle,'\\\" says Dr Litchfield, who is an associate professor at Washington & Jefferson College, Pennsylvania.\\\"Something that's pretty exciting is that a lot more people are going to recognise this as a possibility,\\\" he says. \\\"Although digital nomads will remain avant garde, I'm hopeful that it could improve a lot of people's lives.\\\"Chloe Dickenson and her boyfriend Matt have been riding out the pandemic living in a caravan in the garden of her parents' home in the north of England. She says they are \\\"desperate to go travelling again\\\".\\\"I thought we'd be back on the road in less than six months after arriving home, but over a year later and here we still are,\\\" she says. \\\"It was pretty hard to get accustomed to being stuck in one place again, especially after experiencing all the incredible and vastly diverse cultures that we were lucky enough to enjoy.\\\"We'd love to head back to Malaysia for at least three months as soon as possible as it was one of our favourite places while travelling.\\\" However, Ms Dickenson wants to ensure that they've both had both doses of their Covid vaccinations before they travel abroad again.Meanwhile, Jennifer Nelson says she is waiting for the world to be vaccinated. \\\"I won't be making any big moves until vaccines are mostly rolled out and travel isn't complicated anymore.

Loans are often for small amounts, but not always, and at relatively high interest rates.Its lending is legal and approved by the City regulator, but it has been controversial. Some campaigners regard such operations as \\\"legal loan sharks\\\".One 52-year-old, who borrowed with Provident for 30 years, said he had taken loans totalling £60,000 but it was a \\\"vicious circle\\\".\\\"It was for basic spending, and Christmas, but was too convenient,\\\" he said.The company's payday lending arm - called Satsuma - began operating in 2013 and had recently stopped lending to new customers.Debt adviser Sara Williams, who runs the Debt Camel blog, said: \\\"In August 2020 the Financial Conduct Authority said prolonged relending can be harmful to borrowers. And the Financial Ombudsman has been upholding 75% of affordability complaints against Provident - I estimate the average refund is about £5,000 and many are over £10,000.\\\"From this point, the doorstep lending model has looked dead in the water. There is no way to restructure doorstep lending to be profitable without a significant amount of relending.\\\"Provident has been lending money on the doorstep for about 140 years. Money-lending is a trade with many centuries more of history.But this is a modern story of how professional claims companies have been blitzing firms with complaints about unaffordable lending, many of which have been justified.Critics of Provident will say society is better off without a lender pushing doorstep loans to people who were unable to ever repay them.Supporters say this now leaves a vacuum that illegal loan sharks will exploit.The reality is that some people may now turn to family and friends for advances - creating a dynamic which will be more than just financial.As with many businesses operating in non-mainstream lending, there have been a flood of complaints that the appropriate affordability checks were not carried out when doorstep loans and payday loans were granted. Many of these complaints have been made through claims management companies.Provident said the second half of last year had seen a 200% rise in complaints compared with the first half, and £25m had been paid out.The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, is investigating Provident for the way it handled complaints in the year to February.In March, the company outlined a plan, called a scheme of arrangement, to limit compensation paid to customers who were mis-sold loans. Voting on the proposal was expected in July. The FCA has expressed concern about the idea.Jason Wassell, chief executive of the Consumer Credit Trade Association, which represents alternative lenders, said other companies face the same difficulties as Provident.\\\"The constantly changing approach by the Financial Ombudsman Service, along with the increasing claims culture being driven by claims management companies, is making it difficult for firms to operate and attract investment.\\\"These factors together led to major market exit in the high-cost short-term credit sector, and it has now spread to home credit,\\\" he said.\\\"Market exit is likely to continue across the sector if these problems are not addressed. The outcome will be that access to credit is reduced for a group of consumers who will struggle to borrow elsewhere.\\\"","postDate":"2021-05-10T09:20:19.000Z","title":"Provident Financial withdraws from doorstep lending after 140 years - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-57012254"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/35C1\/production\/_118416731_gettyimages-846088624.jpg","author":"By Anna Meisel and Angus Crawford","description":"More than 40,000 people from the Philippines have been recruited to front British companies as part of schemes costing the UK \\\"hundreds of millions of pounds\\\" in lost taxes.BBC Radio 4's File on 4 discovered more than 48,000 of these companies have been created in the past five years.Some staff at Covid test centres run by G4S have been employed by subcontractors in this kind of scheme.G4S said that, when this came to its attention, HMRC was notified.The company said it was taking steps to ensure that all agency workers were employed directly and not via a subcontractor.At the start of the pandemic, \\\"John\\\" - not his real name - was looking for employment.As the pandemic grew, he saw an advert for staff at his local Covid testing site run by G4S.He rang an employment agency called HR GO, got the job, and - as the second wave of infections hit - started to work. The job was stressful, he says, but the money wasn't bad - £10 an hour.It wasn't until his payslip arrived that he noticed something odd was happening.He was not being paid by G4S or HR GO, the agency that recruited him. Instead, he was paid by a company he had never heard of.He looked it up on Companies House and found it was only set up a month before he started his job - and its director was from the Philippines.He started to think something \\\"sketchy was happening\\\". So why was John employed in such a convoluted way?Employers pay 13.8% in National Insurance contributions on most of their employees' earnings, if the employee earns more than £170 a week.But File on 4 discovered the way in which John is employed is used by recruitment agencies to cut their National Insurance bill.It works by exploiting the government's Employment Allowance - an annual discount of £4,000 per company on National Insurance contributions. The allowance was meant to encourage companies to take on more workers.However, recruitment agencies exploit the allowance by employing temporary workers through a series of mini umbrella companies - or \\\"MUCs\\\".Each individual MUC has only a small number of workers and qualifies for the tax relief. These kind of arrangements can cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions in lost tax revenue a year.HMRC warned against them as early as 2015, saying schemes designed to exploit the Employment Allowance were \\\"too good to be true\\\" and \\\"simply did not work\\\".G4S said their payments to agencies include all of the appropriate insurance contributions - and all staff working on the G4S contracts pay their insurance contributions correctly.HR GO said they were satisfied that the way they have managed their supply chain is \\\"legal and in harmony with the guidance on supply chain management issued by HMRC Threat Response Unit\\\".File on 4 found that more than 48,000 \\\"mini umbrellas\\\" have been created in the UK in the past five years, each following a particular pattern.The companies are originally incorporated with a British director recruited via private groups on Facebook. They resign as directors after a short period of time and a Filipino director is appointed in their place.\\\"Emma\\\", who did not want to use her real name, lives in south-east England and says she was at her lowest ebb when she took part.\\\"At the time, I had broken up with my son's dad. And he left me in the flat with all the bills to pay. And I only had a part-time job because I had a six-month-old baby,\\\" she said.\\\"I started doing it just purely to sort of pay the bills.\\\"Emma signed up to the scheme four times, each time being paid £150 for \\\"fronting\\\" six companies.Her only job was to upload letters she received by post from HMRC and Companies House to an online portal run by a company called WRS Formations.Shortly after that, she would resign as the director of the six businesses and start all over again.On the same day she resigned, a Filipino director would be appointed to \\\"front\\\" these companies. It can be harder for HMRC to pursue companies with directors in other jurisdictions.File on 4 discovered that tens of thousands of Filipinos from some of the poorest regions in the country are being recruited through Facebook and word of mouth.The only qualifications to get the job are an internet connection, a mobile phone number, an email address and an ID document.They have to review and sign the British company's documents through an online portal run by a company called Compass Star Limited.One Filipino director - who didn't want to be named for fear of losing his income - said he signed up last year to support his wife and a baby.He said it was \\\"really very easy\\\" and the extra cash was \\\"a big help\\\". It paid his bills and daily expenses.But he couldn't remember the name of the company he is the director of and doesn't know what the company does.When its name was disclosed to him by File on 4, he said: \\\"Ah yes\\u2026 I've seen it [in the portal].\\\"Thousands of companies fronted by Filipinos are then used to employ workers in the UK, including supply teachers and Covid testers.Compass Star Limited and WRS Formations did not respond to the BBC's letters.Jo Maugham, a tax QC and the founder of the campaigning group the Good Law Project, said the number of companies File on 4 discovered were set up in this way was \\\"staggering\\\".\\\"It's not as though this is some tiny piece of tax avoidance - you know, where your local minicab firm isn't declaring all of the fares that it receives. This is industrial scale tax abuse,\\\" he said.\\\"I mean it's really absolutely extraordinary, hundreds of millions of pounds if not billions of pounds is likely to have been lost due to HMRC's apparent disinclination to tackle this abuse.\\\"Anneliese Dodds, former shadow chancellor, called upon HMRC and the government to do more to tackle these schemes.\\\"We do need to see greater action being taken by HMRC\\u2026 and the Conservative government really should have been facing up to this, because certainly, the alarm bell has been rung by many over many years,\\\" she said.HMRC said it was using both its criminal and civil powers to challenge what it called \\\"MUC fraud\\\" - and recently deregistered more than 22,000 mini umbrella companies thought to be involved in such schemes.It says it has made a number of arrests and taken steps to recover unpaid tax from businesses which knew or should have known about fraud in their supply chain.Additional reporting by Gillian Schonrock and Richard Smith.","postDate":"2021-05-10T02:20:14.000Z","title":"Thousands recruited to front UK firms in 'tax dodge' - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-57021128"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/12B94\/production\/_118429667_1c96344f-1101-478f-bd1d-0135a380c7fc.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"Fifty-two Debenhams stores close their doors for the final time on Saturday, with the rest set to go over the next seven days.

The company is one of Norwich's biggest employers, with some 5,000 staff.At the beginning of the year, the insurance giant said it would be looking to adopt home-working as standard practice.It said time would be shared between working from home and in the office, depending on worker preferences.Mr Connelly found he \\\"couldn't cope\\\" mentally with homeworking, and was \\\"so grateful\\\" he was one of the first to be allowed back, full-time, last month.\\\"It was so bad. I'm such a chatterer and I just needed to see people, so I came back into the office as soon as I could,\\\" he says.Mr Connelly had moved to Norwich from London just before the pandemic hit in March 2020, meaning he did not get a chance to make friends.He lives with his partner, who works at Starbucks in Norwich, so was alone for 90% of the day, something he was not used to.As time went on he found the situation more difficult and working form home \\\"compounded\\\" his loneliness.It led to him being diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder.\\\"The whole isolation thing was horrible. I desperately needed to get back into an office and see people and actually have a conversation eye-to-eye,\\\" he says.His workplace is \\\"extremely\\\" Covid-secure and he feels \\\"100% happier, without a doubt\\\" about being back in the office.'The rest of the world has caught up'Deborah Sacks, a waste and resources specialist, believes she was ahead of the game when she set up her business in 2010.She works from home and uses shared office space at Businesss Revolution in Norwich once or twice a week.It means \\\"a chance to get out of the house, somewhere where I can really focus, can't do the housework or get another snack,\\\" she says.\\\"I feel the rest of the world has caught up with where I was working before.\\\"It's important to meet other human beings, not just your family, where the Wifi is more reliable, a change of scenery really,\\\" she adds.'Feeling anxious'According to clinical psychologist Dr Beth Mosley, the return to the office is going to make some people \\\"feel pretty anxious because it's another change\\\".\\\"To have to go back into the office and re-learn some of those old skills, coupled with the pressures of the commute, for some people it will raise levels of anxiety,\\\" she says.The key to coping is to \\\"understand that your stress is natural\\\".\\\"The best thing to do, is to do the thing we are worried about. It is normally the best way to stop feeling anxious about it.\\\"She advises noticing the physical changes such as headaches or an increased heart rate and finding ways, such as deep breathing, to relax.\\\"We might struggle with change but actually we are incredibly good at adjusting,\\\" says Dr Mosley.'We need office workers to come back'Anita Adcock owns the Mushy Peas stall on Norwich market. She cannot wait for more people to return to the office.\\\"We've already lost a lot of footfall from people not coming to the shops, who are buying online, so now with people not coming into work everyday, then we are going to lose them as well.\\\"A lot of our trade is lunchtime trade with people taking away for the office or standing and eating by the stall for half-an hour.\\\"She says traders have been discussing ways to encourage more customers, including a covered seating area with heaters.\\\"I think what we need to do is to look at the market as a social meeting place again, like it used to be years ago,\\\" she adds.\\\"Maybe we need to start opening on evenings, but we need more facilities to allow us to do so,\\\" she adds.Two rows away is Barclay Gray of Lucys Fish and Chips.\\\"We're reliant on shoppers, visitors and a lot of people who work in the offices.

We want to get people away on holiday, having a great time, because we think they genuinely all deserve it.\\\"Confusing systemsA lack of clarity about how governments will go about recognising vaccine and testing statuses from other countries is troubling the travel industry, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.Mr Fogel believes a single system would be helpful: \\\"So many different people in so many different governments are talking about different programmes, but right now, there is nothing out there that is unified, so it's very confusing.\\\"I listened to the prime minister of Italy saying how they want to let people into Italy soon and you just have to prove that you have a vaccine and it'd be great.\\\"And my thinking is, well, I have my vaccine myself, but how do I prove it? Do I just bring my little white card that I got in the US that said I got it, is that going to be good enough?

It hasn't revealed details of any schemes that might potentially be cut.The Prime Minister has previously re-committed himself to £100bn spending on HS2 rail, which was designed in part to relieve congestion on the Euston to Birmingham route.But some schemes in the £27bn roads programme may now be facing the axe in the post-Covid world.It's impossible to forecast traffic demand with certainty, but many previously-congested roads are flowing much more freely out of rush-hour than they were before.That's because even a small decrease in the number of cars prevents a heavily-congested road from reaching gridlock.It isn't just transport economists, concerned about a potential waste of public money, who are putting pressure on the roads programme. It's coming from environmentalists too.They are taking ministers to court, because they say the government's plans for roads are on a collision path with targets to cut carbon emissions.Even if new stretches of road are increasingly used by electric cars, it would still take decades before they become carbon neutral, because of all the emissions produced to make the cement, steel and tarmac for the roads.The AA's president Edmund King has argued that as working from home for part of the week becomes ingrained in British society, it's rational for the government to divert some of the roads budget to improving broadband.This would also increase the number of jobs created, because large highly-mechanised road schemes employ relatively few workers.Chris Todd from the environmental group Transport Action Network (Tan) told the BBC: \\\"The end of commuting as we know it undermines arguments for road expansion.\\\"Coming alongside new figures showing that carbon emissions and the economic case for smart motorways are far worse than forecast, the case for a change in direction is overwhelming.\\\"With the daily commute ending for many and ever more journeys being walked and cycled, giving up a car will make sense for many households.\\\"He added that it was \\\"vital\\\" that the government enable this societal change of habits towards cycling and public transport, by redirecting cash for roads into repairing potholes, creating new cycle lanes, improving bus services and providing long distance options for those who don't own cars.Supporters of road-building insist that demand will bounce back when the pandemic is over. But Tan believes some road schemes will be judged economically unviable as a result of changing trends.It says smart motorway schemes, such as the M25, are vulnerable - as the congestion used to justify them is typically restricted to peak hours.Tan suggests urban schemes, such as A38 widening in Derby, might be being reconsidered, because so much traffic on them is short distance peak hour commuting.The controversial A27 Arundel bypass may be squeezed out too, because, again, hold-ups are typically caused by commuters.Pinch point schemes and junction upgrades may face the axe as well, since these are also usually justified in terms of tackling peak hour congestion.Despite its review of transport spending, the government is preparing to contest a court case over road expansion brought by the environmental group.Meanwhile, ministers are drawing up the Transport Decarbonisation Strategy promised by the prime minister to help the sector achieve deeper emissions cuts.While others sectors of the economy have been shrinking their emissions, transport has been doing the opposite.Follow Roger on Twitter.","postDate":"2021-05-06T19:58:47.000Z","title":"Road and rail building plans under review after Covid - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-57010913"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/11D45\/production\/_118392037_dannyharmer.jpg","author":"By Simon Read","description":"Almost all of 50 of the UK's biggest employers questioned by the BBC have said they do not plan to bring staff back to the office full-time.Some 43 of the firms said they would embrace a mix of home and office working, with staff encouraged to work from home two to three days a week.Four firms said they were keeping the idea of hybrid working, working from home some of the time, under review.Currently, people who can work from home are still advised to do so.However, that is likely to change in June when the government hopes to end all social distancing restrictions.\\\"We're never going to go back to working the way we used to work,\\\" said Mark Read, chief executive of advertising firm WPP.But the new ways of using the office require careful planning, he told the BBC.\\\"People are working from home three to four days a week so we probably need 20% less space, but we're not going to do that if everyone's working from home on Mondays and Fridays.\\\"Other companies cite \\\"smart working\\\" and \\\"flexibility\\\" as reasons for introducing hybrid working, with many suggesting that workers would be able to make their own choices about how often they come into the office.Danny Harmer, chief people officer at insurance giant Aviva - which has 16,000 UK workers - said 95% of its workers said they would like to be able to spend some of their time working flexibly and remotely in different locations.But she said the company had to be mindful that many staff appreciate being in an office, such as those who live alone or do not have a suitable place to work.Recruitment firm Adecco, which has 34,000 workers, said about four-fifths of its staff now work remotely.\\\"Rather than having pre-set rules we are encouraging our leaders to engage with colleagues to implement strategies that work for their business,\\\" it said.The BBC questioned 50 big employers, ranging from banks to retailers, to get an idea of when workers may return to the office.The firms contacted by the BBC covered 1.1 million workers in the UK.Reopening officesBusinesses that depend on custom from office workers - such as cafes and restaurants - are keen for them to return as soon as possible.\\\"We rely really heavily on the office trade,\\\" Joao Almeida, of Panda Cup Coffee in London's Blackfriars, told the BBC.

He returned to the stockbroker's office he works at two weeks ago.\\\"There's something healthy about having a psychological separation between your work and home life. I find that hard to do when I'm working from home,\\\" he told the BBC.\\\"There's something quite gloomy, especially in winter, about working from home, and it's depressing waking up and commuting to your kitchen.\\\"It also makes it much harder to collaborate.

More than £100bn has already been spent on support for jobs.Can I ask to keep working from home?You can ask to keep working from home, but that doesn't mean your employer has to agree.The Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development (CIPD), which represents HR professionals, says decisions will depend on factors including individual circumstances and the type of job.It says: \\\"Employers have a duty of care to all their staff and [must] treat people reasonably and fairly... and be as flexible as possible when dealing with any concerns people have.\\\"However, lots of companies have already said they expect to have a mixture of staff in the office and at home. Several firms have said that workers will be able to decide where they're based.That's partly because the pandemic has shown that home-working can be effective, but also because shutting or reducing office space can save money.What does my employer have to do to keep me safe?In England, the current guidance says employers should complete a Covid risk assessment, and take steps to prevent transmission, including:All retail staff and customers must wear face coverings, unless they're exempt.Regular lateral flow testing for Covid is already widespread in many sectors, and anyone in England or Scotland can also order tests directly.There's more detailed guidance for specific industries including construction, hospitality and manufacturing.Similar advice is available for employers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.If employees feel unsafe, they can contact their local authority, Citizens Advice or the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The HSE has carried more than 200,000 inspections to check companies are following Covid rules, and can force firms to take action if not.Is it safe to use public transport?Much of the risk depends on how crowded it is, and your distance from other people.Wearing a mask helps, as does keeping windows open, and avoiding peak journey times where possible.Train companies are increasing capacity to help prevent overcrowding, and are carrying out extra cleaning.Transport for London says it's using hospital-grade cleaning materials across its trains, trams, buses and stations.It also says capacity limits will remain on all non-school buses, to help maintain social distancing.What are my rights if I am in a vulnerable group?The previous advice to millions of people considered \\\"clinically extremely vulnerable\\\" to shield. has ended.Many will continue to work from home, but if your job cannot be done remotely, your employer can ask you to return to the workplace.However, they still have a responsibility to keep you safe, so you should raise any specific concerns you have about going back.In addition, if you are disabled, your employer has an extra responsibility to make and pay for \\\"reasonable adjustments\\\".","postDate":"2021-05-05T16:13:36.000Z","title":"Covid: Should I be working from home or going back to the office? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-52567567"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/3D30\/production\/_118446651_gettyimages-1231467614.jpg","author":"By Cristina Criddle","description":"Live-audio app Clubhouse is launching on Google\\u2019s Android, more than a year after its initial launch.The invitation-only platform has previously been available on only Apple\\u2019s App Store, where downloads have significantly fallen.The app spiked in popularity this year, with celebrities using the service and invitations being sold online.But many are questioning its long-term viability, after competitors Facebook and Twitter launched copycat features.Clubhouse said it was testing the app for users in the US initially, with UK and other English-speaking countries to follow \\\"in the coming days\\\".\\u201COur plan over the next few weeks is to collect feedback from the community, fix any issues we see and work to add a few final features like payments and club creation before rolling it out more broadly,\\u201D the technology company blogged .It thanked Android users for their patience and said the app would be rolled out to the rest of the world during the next few weeks and users outside the US could register to receive a notification when it was available in their area.'Compelling-content creators'Clubhouse had about 13.4 million users in late March, according to research company App Annie.But after peaking in February, with 9.6 million downloads, it had had just 2.7 million in March and 900,000 in April, mobile-app-store analysts Sensor Tower said.Enders Analysis technology head Joseph Evans said: \\u201CClubhouse is still invite-only, so they are not judging success by how many people are using it.\\u201CThey are much more focused on getting compelling-content creators and then hoping that the users will follow at some point in the future.\\u201DBut \\u201Cdeep-pocketed\\u201D rivals could steal users from Clubhouse by creating a more polished product.Facebook is testing a web-based app of its own called Hotline, which lets hosts chat to their audience via audio and text and will be available to both Android and Apple users.And Twitter has launched Spaces, an audio-streaming feature inside the existing Twitter app, which will soon allow users to charge for admission to its audio chat rooms.'Increasingly irrelevant'\\\"People can now have the best of both worlds on the platforms they know and trust, rather than jumping between multiple social networks,\\\" South Coast Social social-media agency founder Clare Groombridge said.All In content-creator agency founder Kevin Tewe said Clubhouse\\u2019s initial success had been due to people staying at home during the pandemic.\\u201CUsers soon realised it is always the same topics by the same people, who are selling themselves or getting deals for their agencies,\\\" he said.And the platform would become increasingly irrelevant as people were allowed to interact in person more.","postDate":"2021-05-10T12:34:55.000Z","title":"Clubhouse launches on Android as app downloads collapse - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-57058516"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/183BA\/production\/_117885299_clubhouse.jpg","author":"By Leo Kelion & David Molloy","description":"Live-audio app Clubhouse is creating plenty of chatter - about itself.Elon Musk, Oprah Winfrey, Kanye West, Demi Lovato and Mark Zuckerberg are among the celebrities to have popped up on the service. And you can find chats about everything from Bitcoin and Buddhism to relationships and R&B music on it.Even so, the idea that this one-year-old app could be worth $4bn (£2.9bn) is startling.It stems from a Bloomberg report saying the San Francisco-based start-up is seeking fresh funds at this level.But it was only in January that venture capital fund Andreessen Horowitz bought a stake valuing the firm at a quarter of the sum.The jump may be justified by a follow-up report that Twitter has discussed buying the app for the higher price - although it declined to confirm this when asked.Why would Clubhouse be worth so much?Clubhouse had about 13.4 million users in late March, according to research firm App Annie, having added about a fifth of that number over the previous four weeks alone.In short, it's growing quickly - despite being \\\"invite only\\\" and limited to Apple's iOS - and appears to have found a gap in the market.\\\"It's at the intersection of several hot trends - audio, live and social,\\\" said Joseph Evans from Enders Analysis.\\\"And it's recreating some of the things we can't do normally because of the coronavirus pandemic restrictions, such as attending a talk or having a group conversation.\\\"At present the app doesn't make any money. But that's not necessarily important.As Sarah Frier's book No Filter recounts, Mark Zuckerberg insisted Instagram take its time before introducing ads after Facebook bought the photo app in 2012 for a then-groundbreaking $1bn.The reason, he said, was that it was more important to establish \\\"staying power\\\" first.But Instagram only achieved its value because both Facebook and Twitter wanted to buy the business.And that's unlikely to be the case this time round.\\\"A few years ago Facebook would probably have already put an offer on the table [for Clubhouse], said Mr Evans.\\\"But it's not in the market for another social network because of the competition scrutiny that it's under, so Facebook's only option is to compete with it.\\\"Indeed, Facebook has just launched a new web-based app of its own called Hotline, which lets hosts chat to their audience via audio and text.What other rivals are out there?Twitter has already launched Spaces, an audio-streaming feature inside the existing Twitter app.It is being rolled out to select creators first, but the plan is to allow anyone to create a \\\"space\\\" later this month.Chat app Telegram launched a voice chat feature last year, and revamped the feature in March to work like Clubhouse's one-to-many dynamic.And Discord - a sleeping giant in the voice comms space - has just launched Stages, where one speaker \\\"on stage\\\" can speak to many people at once.Business-focused giants Slack and LinkedIn are known to be working on the idea too.Many of these apps have much bigger audiences than Clubhouse ever has had - and are available on more platforms, including Android and PCs.What other challenges does Clubhouse face?Content moderation is set to be a big issue.Clubhouse has already attracted controversy with reports of it being used by far-right personalities to discuss claims of women fabricating rape accusations, as well as instances of racism, sexism and anti-Semitism.And this isn't a good time to attract this kind of attention.Politicians in the US are threatening to remove legal protections given to social networks under a law known as Section 230, after accusing them of bias and allowing harmful material to run rampant.And in the UK, the proposed Online Safety Bill could soon give regulator Ofcom the power to block apps it judges to have failed to protect users.Policing live audio is a lot harder than using algorithms to detect offensive text-based comments.And while Clubhouse does retain audio recordings of chats if an incident is reported to it in \\\"real-time\\\", it does not do so if a user tries to report a past offence, hindering any follow-up investigation.Another risk is that Clubhouse might not prove \\\"sticky\\\" enough with its users.One early adopter says she has found herself using it less and less because there are podcasts and other media available that do a better job of competing for her attention.\\\"Clubhouse makes it really easy for people to create content, but actually the content itself is surprisingly hard to use,\\\" said Sharon O'Dea, an Amsterdam-based digital communications consultant.\\\"You can't share it, you can't record it, you can't quote it, and it often takes speakers ages to get to their key point.\\\"It just feels to me like it's it doesn't respect my time as a consumer.\\\"How might Clubhouse become profitable?The traditional way for social networks to make money is adverts.But an audio-only format makes that difficult.Would users stick around if forced to listen to pre-roll promotions? Would the natural flow of conversations be damaged by hosts having to pause for regular breaks, or worse ads simply playing over parts of discussions, in a similar way to how Twitch interrupts video gameplay?As an alternative, the app's creators have suggested they could take a cut of payments made by listeners to room hosts in order to thank them or access premium \\\"ticketed\\\" content.Patreon, another start-up, has already built a business around this model, and was valued at $4bn in its latest funding round.Clubhouse has just introduced a money transfer tool of its own - but for now has opted to let 100% of payments go to creators rather than taking a commission.","postDate":"2021-04-08T13:51:43.000Z","title":"Clubhouse: Is the audio app really worth $4bn? - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-56676214"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/6AF2\/production\/_117087372_gettyimages-1231054164.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"Audio chat app Clubhouse has doubled its download numbers in just over two weeks, according to download estimates by one analytics firm.App Annie reports that the app saw global downloads grow from 3.5 million to 8.1 million between 1 and 16 February.The invite-only app has surged in popularity amid appearances by some high-profile celebrities.But that popularity has also seen the firm attract significant criticism.Experts highlighted that data from the app is sometimes routed through Chinese servers - even if users are in the United States or other countries. And privacy concerns have also been raised over how the app checks users' contact books.But those concerns appear to have had little impact on user interest.The growth has happened despite the restrictions of Clubhouse's model: it is only available for iPhones, and each user is only able to invite a few others.About 2.6 million of the recent downloads were in the United States, App Annie says in its report, but there was also a wide spread around the world.Part of the demand may have been fuelled by the appearance of technology figures such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg - and Facebook is now rumoured to be working on a similar product to compete.However, download numbers may not be an accurate indicator of the number of actual users.The app can be downloaded from the Apple App Store without actually having the invite needed to use it.Clubhouse is encouraging users to download the app anyway - because doing so allows new users to reserve their username for the future.Usernames can be a hot commodity on leading social networks, where competition for real names - or short, snappy ones - can be intense.Clubhouse does not release user numbers itself, but some estimates place the number of users at more than six million.","postDate":"2021-02-19T13:04:48.000Z","title":"Clubhouse downloads double in two weeks, analytics firm says - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-56127226"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/F4F0\/production\/_118440726_screenshot2021-05-09at18.19.12.png","author":"By Joe Tidy","description":"Martin Lewis and Sir Richard Branson are the celebrities whose names are used most in fake endorsement scams, a report has found.The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) removed more than 730,000 websites running the tricks in 2020.Mr Lewis, founder of the website Money Saving Expert, said the whole issue sickened him.Experts at the cyber-agency, which is part of intelligence agency GCHQ, say it's a growing problem.What are fake endorsement scams?Criminals create fake news articles claiming that celebrities are backing new investment schemes.The articles are spread through mass email campaigns, SMS texts, or adverts on social media.They come with a link to websites which encourage victims to invest in the unscrupulous programmes.Although the theme of these attacks is often cryptocurrency, the template can be used to promote any type of fake investment opportunity.\\\"Makes me feel nauseous\\\"Mr Lewis said: 'It's the worst flattery I've ever had.

Today, a lower \\\"nm\\\" number is widely seen as a marketing term to describe new generations of the technology, leading to better performance and lower power.IBM says its 2nm process can cram 50 billion transistors into \\\"a chip the size of a fingernail\\\" - up from 30 billion when it announced its 5nm breakthrough in 2017.The end result should be another performance bump for computers in the coming years.'A breakthrough'Current high-end desktop chips based on the 7nm process, such as AMD's Ryzen processors, did not become widely available until 2019 - four years after IBM announced it had cracked the 7nm process.But mainstream commercial chip-makers such as Intel and TSMC - which makes AMD processors - have already said they plan to build ultra-low nm chip plants in the next several years.\\\"This can be considered as a breakthrough,\\\" said Peter Rudden, research director at market intelligence firm IDC.\\\"We have seen semiconductor manufacturers moving from 14nm to 10nm to 7nm, with 7nm being a real challenge for some,\\\" he explained.He said IBM's new process could be used for AI uses that today need a second piece of tech - such as a powerful graphics card- to handle some tasks. The increased power efficiency could be useful in personal devices, while increased performance would benefit huge datacentres, he added.\\\"This also sends a message to the IT industry that IBM continues to be a hardware research powerhouse.\\\"Chip warsIBM said the test chip for its 2nm process was built at its Albany research lab in the United States.The news comes amid an international shortage of computer chips and a bid to shake up chip manufacturing to rely less on major foundries in China and Taiwan.Car manufacturers have been forced to suspend production due to the lack of computer parts; smartphone makers have warned product releases could be affected; and high-end computer components such as graphics cards are difficult to find and selling for high prices.On Thursday, Nintendo joined the chorus of concerned companies, saying the chip shortage was affecting production of its hugely popular Nintendo Switch console.The worldwide shortage led US President Joe Biden to convene a special industry summit on the shortage. In the UK, the government has intervened in the acquisition of chip designer Arm by tech giant Nvidia.And Intel's chief executive has announced a $20bn (£14.6bn) investment in two new plants in the US, telling the BBC that having 80% of the world chip supply in Asia is not a good idea.You might also be interested in:","postDate":"2021-05-06T12:27:13.000Z","title":"IBM 2nm chip breakthrough claims more power with less energy - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-57009930"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/2048\/cpsprodpb\/17337\/production\/_118413059_music_medicine_tech_tent.png","author":"Rory Cellan-Jones","description":"Ever tried to relax after a stressful day by putting on some music - a little Mozart, some gentle jazz - or perhaps a little Natalie Imbruglia? Well, now a start-up tech company says it is proving that the right playlist can have medical benefits.On this week's Tech Tent, we explore whether music might really be the best medicine.MediMusic is a company based in Hull with big ambitions to transform healthcare with its music technology. It claims that by using artificial intelligence to craft playlists suited to an individual patient, it can reduce anxiety and pain.The company's founder Gary Jones tells Tech Tent that MediMusic has developed algorithms which generate a playlist of up to 400 tracks designed to have a measurable effect on a patient.\\\"They put the headphones on, they listen to the music, and over a period of time, what will happen is that their heart rate will reduce, blood pressure will reduce, the production of the stress hormone cortisol will reduce,\\\" he says.A heart rate monitor worn on the wrist measures the physiological effect on the patient and MediMusic says its Digital Drip system uses machine learning to swap tracks in the playlist if the listener does not respond as expected.The NHS in Lancashire is taking an interest, trialling the technology in hospitals with patients and healthcare workers.Dr Jacqueline Twamley, innovation manager at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, described the way the system had been tested with dementia patients: \\\"If we know something's going to be challenging for a patient, or a patient is going to get restless, we can then try the music system before that and see if it helps to keep them settled.\\\"She says the music brought out a variety of emotions.\\\"Some patients are saying they were sad when it ended. We had one patient who burst out crying, which was alarming. But he said afterwards it brought back such happy memories.\\\"But Dr Twamley says there were also measurable effects, with reductions in heart rate and levels of cortisol.MediMusic says dementia patients saw reductions of up to 22% in their heart rate, and makes the extraordinary claim that its technology could help the NHS cut medication bills in some areas by up to a quarter.But is there any proof that an AI-designed playlist is more effective than just popping on the patient's favourite tracks? Gary Jones insists that research shows that your own choice of music won't necessarily reduce your heart rate, and is confident his technology will end up being prescribed to both patients and stressed medical staff.Big claims are made for the savings artificial intelligence can deliver in all sorts of industries. But healthcare providers will want to have much more data on the positive effects of music before investing in systems like this.Also in this week's programmeFacebook's supreme court, the Oversight Board, says it was right to suspend Donald Trump, wrong to make the ban indefinite.

There can be no more divisive issue than President Trump's presence on a platform credited or blamed by many for his electoral success in 2016 and probably crucial if he decides to run again in 2024.Now, the Oversight Board has thrown the hot potato right back into Mr Zuckerberg's lap.He and his team have been told to go away and have a long hard think about how they handle tricky cases like this one. They will have to decide the meaning of the term \\\"newsworthy\\\" and conduct a proper inquest into the platform's role in the events of 6 January.And at the end of it all, Facebook will still have to decide what to do about Donald Trump.Mark Zuckerberg could be forgiven for wondering whether setting up this body was such a good idea after all - and why he is paying the generous salaries of the board's members.What is the Oversight Board?Often referred to as \\\"Facebook's Supreme Court\\\", it was set up to rule on difficult or controversial moderation decisions made by Facebook.It was established by Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg but operates as an independent entity, although its wages and other costs are covered by Facebook. It is made up of journalists, human rights activists, lawyers and academics.The committee has already ruled on nine cases including a comment that seemed derogatory to Muslims. The post from a user in Myanmar, removed for breaking hate-speech rules, was found by the board not to be Islamophobic when taken in context.What happened to Trump's account?Following the Capitol Hill riots on 6 January, Facebook announced it was banning Mr Trump for breaking its \\\"glorification of violence\\\" rules.Hundreds of his supporters entered the complex as the US Congress attempted to certify Joe Biden's victory in last year's presidential election.Mr Trump was acquitted of a charge of inciting insurrection at the US Capitol in his second impeachment trial in February, after being accused of encouraging the violence in which five people lost their lives.The social network had originally imposed a 24-hour ban after the attack which was then extended \\\"indefinitely\\\".Mr Zuckerberg announced that the risks of allowing Mr Trump to post were \\\"simply too great\\\".The former president has also been banned from Twitter and YouTube.","postDate":"2021-05-05T20:27:30.000Z","title":"Facebook's Trump ban upheld by Oversight Board for now - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-56985583"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/A90D\/production\/_118077234_plastic.2.prince_ruiz_credittashihallphotography.jpg","author":"By David Silverberg","description":"When Rebecca Prince-Ruiz recalls how her eco-friendly movement Plastic Free July has progressed over the years, she can't help but smile. What began in 2011 as 40 people committing to going plastic-free one month a year has gained momentum to 326 million people pledging to adopt this practice today.\\\"I've seen that uptick in interest every year,\\\" says Ms Prince-Ruiz, who is based in Perth, Australia, and author of Plastic Free: The Inspiring Story of a Global Environmental Movement and Why It Matters.\\\"These days, people are taking a hard look at what they are doing in their lives and how they can seize an opportunity to be less wasteful,\\\" she says.Since 2000, the plastics industry has manufactured as much plastic as all the preceding years combined, a World Wildlife Fund report in 2019 found. \\\"The production of virgin plastic has increased 200-fold since 1950, and has grown at a rate of 4% a year since 2000,\\\" the report says.This has spurred companies to replace single-use plastic with biodegradable and compostable packaging designed to dramatically reduce the toxic footprint plastics leave behind.In March, Mars Wrigley and Danimer Scientific announced a new two-year partnership to develop compostable packaging for Skittles in the US, estimated to be on shelves by early 2022.It involves a type of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) that will look and feel the same as plastic, but can be thrown into the compost where it will break down, unlike regular plastic that takes anywhere from 20 to 450 years to fully decompose.Danimer Scientific's polymer product is made from canola oil, and it acts similarly to wood, meaning it breaks down when bacteria interact with it. \\\"PHA goes away naturally and is still a very strong material for all types of products,\\\" says Stephen Croskrey, chief executive of Danimer Scientific, based in the US state of Georgia.Alastair Child, Mars Wrigley vice-president for global sustainability, says: \\\"Our vision is to support a circular economy where packaging never becomes waste and by 2025 we plan to reduce our virgin plastic use by 25% and for 100% of our plastic packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable.\\\"Hindering the widespread use of eco-friendly packaging such as PHA is the cost. It can be three to fives time as expensive to manufacture as regular plastic.But that hasn't stopped companies such as California-based Mango Materials and London-based Polymateria from dedicating their businesses to producing products that biodegrade over a shorter period of time.For example, Polymateria's Cycle+ plastic is biodegradable after three years and is still able to be recycled during its usable lifetime. Their clients range from East Africa businesses making bread bags to Extreme E, a new electric racing series that uses Polymateria products for cups and food packaging.The plastics industry should wake up to the growing trend of alternative packaging, says Niall Dunne, chief executive of Polymateria. \\\"We've seen how consumer pressure is saying to the big guys that they have to be on board [with reducing their plastic production] and to be more transparent and authentic in this important conversation,\\\" Mr Dunne says.Meg Sobkowicz, associate professor of plastics engineering at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, says that kind of pressure has already worked to push the plastics industry to steer away from the toxic BPA ingredient that was commonly found in reusable plastic bottles. \\\"I think we're coming around to where public concern is pushing them to tip the scales in favour of environmentally friendly packaging, despite its costs.\\\"More Technology of BusinessForward-thinking engineers plan to get even more creative with their biodegradable packaging solutions, such as a Scottish research team using waste material from shellfish to make a new type of packaging. And designer Alice Potts has blended food waste with flowers from London parks to craft a series of bioplastic face shields.\\\"We know we can't do this alone,\\\" says Mars Wrigley's Alastair Child.\\\"Achieving a circular economy will take industry, governments, NGOs and consumers all working together. We would love to see more and more material and design innovations from which we can all learn come to market, but the most important thing is that we see a stronger commitment to closing the loop.\\\"","postDate":"2021-05-03T23:03:47.000Z","title":"Food giants respond to worries over packaging - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56770732"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/201C\/production\/_118302280_gettyimages-1232428408.jpg","author":"By Karishma Vaswani","description":"When Microsoft's Bill Gates said in 1994 that \\\"banking is necessary, banks are not\\\", financiers and analysts alike dismissed the claims as the wild musings of an over-imaginative techie.Fast forward a few decades and that vision is fast becoming reality.Grab is one of the most dominant super apps in Asia, offering rides, food delivery and now, financial services.That includes loans, insurance, payments and investments - all accessed through a mobile phone app.Launched in 2012 as a ride-hailing app like Uber, Grab has since expanded broadly. In 2018, it pushed Uber out of South East Asia.Grab's goal is to eventually transform into a virtual bank for South East Asia's 600 million strong population.But increased competition and governments seeking to curb the influence of powerful super apps could get in the way of those ambitions.Humble beginningsGrab started life in Malaysia in 2012, as an online taxi booking service initially called MyTeksi.Co-founder Anthony Tan had the idea when he was studying at Harvard Business School.The pitch was to make taxi rides safer and more convenient for Malaysians.But first they needed investors.Kee Lock Chua is a Managing Partner at Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia and India, and one of the first institutional investors in Grab.The other investor? Anthony Tan's mum.\\\"We saw how he spent time with his mum, how he talked to her, and how much respect he gave her,\\\" Mr Chua explained.\\\"That told us he had strong character and conviction.\\\"\\\"Besides the solid idea, that helped us to make the decision to invest in the business.\\\"Mr Chua's firm invested $11.2m (£8.1m) in Grab, giving Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia and India a 22% stake in the company.He exited the investment seven years later, making more than 10 times that amount.Banker to the masses?As Grab's popularity grew, the company realised many of its drivers didn't have bank accounts.The head of Grab Financial Group Reuben Lai had to help drivers sign up for accounts so they could get paid and also arrange loans for their cars.\\\"After doing that for a number of years, we started asking ourselves, 'why are we doing [this]?\\\" he said.\\\"That was when we realised that six out of 10 people across South East Asia are underserved by banks.\\\"\\\"It could be a lack of data [or] it could be the high costs of serving them.\\\"\\\"We want to be...the platform that enables financial institutions to serve this emerging consumer.South East Asia's informal economyThat includes Natthakan Khingpat in Bangkok, who opened his restaurant during the first wave of Covid-19 last year.He gets the bulk of his orders from the Grab app and has been lucky: business is brisk.He needed to borrow money to expand but going to a traditional bank was never an option.\\\"If I were to pay for the high monthly interest rates, I [don't] think I could survive,\\\" he told the BBC.Grab has loaned Mr Natthakan almost $4,000 and the repayments are deducted from his daily earnings.\\\"I could go in [to the app] and look at how much per day I had to pay back.\\\"I thought I would be able to pull it off\\u2026.it felt almost like I wasn't taking out a loan.\\\"Many of the firm's first customers for its financial services were drivers.Boon Kok has driven a Grab car for three years and now takes out health insurance through the app.\\\"Every single drive I take, [the app] will deduct 10 cent(s) so I think it's very affordable,\\\" he says.He's now got coverage worth $113,000.The company is now looking to target digitally savvy millennials.Jixun Foo, a Managing Partner of GGV Capital and another early investor in the company, said his advice to Grab's leadership was to get into financial services from the start.\\\"Once you have your [digital] wallet you start to use it,\\\" he told me.\\\"Then it is natural that you use it to buy things, you want to access better credit [and] when you are travelling you may want to buy travel insurance along with it.\\\"\\\"It's just the natural next step.\\\"Lessons from ChinaGrab has followed the Chinese model, leveraging on its customer base and offering financial services to them.Chinese investors in Grab - including hailing app Didi Chuxing and tech giant Tencent - provided both expertise and financing.But regulators in China have recently cracked down on the powerful tech industry, in an attempt to rein them in.\\\"In China, the government was less aware of how the concentration of power could happen,\\\" says Professor Nitin Pangarkar from the National University of Singapore's Business School.\\\"Other governments are seeing that this happened in China and if they don't want to let it happen in their own countries they have to step in and regulate,\\\" he adds.Bumpy road aheadThe risks to Grab are also mounting.It won a digital bank license in Singapore and is hoping to launch in 2022, but analysts say regulation will be a key concern going forward.\\\"I think digital banking in south east Asia is going to be tough, because regulators will definitely be protective of their turf,\\\" Robson Lee, partner at Gibson Dunn tells me.It also has plans to list in the US later this year, with a valuation of $40bn.\\\"They have forecasted very good numbers but I think the devil is in the details,\\\" Mr Lee said.\\\"I think investors have got to continue to be vigilant and watch this very carefully.\\\"","postDate":"2021-05-03T02:55:52.000Z","title":"Grab: How an Uber killer became a powerful Asian super-app - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56967633"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/161FA\/production\/_118281609_newreefballsunderwaterwithdiversmallersize.jpg","author":"By Bernd Debusmann Jr","description":"Florida firm Eternal Reefs says that interest in its rather unusual service has shot up as a result of the pandemic.Since 1998 it has been helping the newly deceased turn their remains into artificial reef formations on the ocean's floor. It does this by adding their ashes to an environmentally-friendly concrete mix.\\\"The pandemic has accelerated interest, absolutely,\\\" says George Frankel, Eternal Reef's chief executive. \\\"I believe the pandemic has opened a lot of people up to the concept of something other than a traditional burial.\\\"We get people who have got some vested interest in the ocean, but we also get a number of people who like the idea of giving back.\\\"As of last year, more than 2,000 of the company's reefs have been placed in 25 locations off the US east coast.The Covid-19 pandemic has caused heartache for millions of people around the world who have lost loved ones. It has also undoubtedly reminded us all that life is finite.This has in turn led to more people thinking creatively about what they want done with their body or ashes after they have died.For people who want their remains to stay on land, Seattle-based business Recompose has developed a \\\"human composting\\\" technology that turns dead bodies into soil.The body is laid to rest in a sealed steel cylinder, together with wood chips, straw and cuttings from a legume plant called alfalfa. Recompose then controls the levels of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen, heat and moisture in the tube, to enable microbes and bacteria to thrive.After 30 days the composting process is complete, and three cubic ft (85 litres) of earth is removed from the cylinder to then be cured and aerated for a few weeks. Recompose suggests that the finished soil is then spread at a conservation forest in Washington state that it helps to look after, but it can alternatively be collected by loved ones, or a combination of the two.Katrina Spade, who set up the business in 2017, says she has seen a big rise in applications for its monthly prepayment programme since the start of the pandemic.\\\"It's more of a way of having a conversation with yourself and with your friends and family,\\\" she says, \\\"but also making a concerted effort to put a stake in the ground, and say that when you die you want an option that is gentle to the planet.\\\"We've heard from a lot of people that this provides them with a sense of hope and comfort.\\\"This year the global death care services sector is expected to be worth $110bn (£79bn), according to market research firm The Business Research Company. It predicts that this will rise to $148bn by 2025.The increase in options for what you can do with your loved one's remains, and the growth in the associated technology, comes as the number of cremations in recent decades continues to rise - more and more people are not simply being buried.In the US, it was expected that 56% of people who died last year would be cremated, and that is forecast to go up to 78% in the next 20 years. In the 1960s the figure was only 4%.It is a similar picture in the UK, where 78% of the deceased were cremated in 2019, compared with 35% in 1960.New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.Peter Billingham, a UK-based funeral and afterlife industry expert, runs a podcast called Death Goes Digital. He says that the pandemic has accelerated the use and acceptance of technology in the sector. \\\"Covid has sped up these changes far more than I believe would happened by genetic growth,\\\" he says.The move to live streaming of funeral services, because Covid restrictions cap the number of mourners who can attend in person, is a case in point.When Michael Berrin's father Mervyn died in New York earlier this year he did just this. Employing a company called Tribucast to live stream the funeral enabled people across the US, and in other countries including Canada, India, Israel, Panama, Sweden and the UK to watch the proceedings in high-resolution video and sound.\\\"Everyone felt like they were a part of the ceremony even if they were not physically there,\\\" says Mr Berrin.Bruce Likly, co-founder of Connecticut-based Tribucast, says that his company's phones \\\"lit up\\\" throughout the past year.\\\"Our business grew dramatically,\\\" he says. \\\"We think of it as a trend that was already coming, that was further catalysed by the pandemic.\\\"Tribucast was launched in 2017, and also films burials. Mr Likly says its remote attendance technology was already increasingly popular as a result of the changing dynamic of families and friendship groups.Whereas in previous generations families and social groups were more often relatively concentrated in specific geographic areas, they are now increasingly spread across a country, or even internationally.This often makes funeral attendance difficult, especially for people of the Jewish or Islamic faiths whose religions require that a body is buried within 24 hours.\\\"Even three or four years ago we were seeing 40 to 60 people attend each funeral remotely,\\\" says Mr Likly. \\\"That's ironic, because that is the US national average of in-person attendance.\\\"We were effectively doubling funeral attendance just by giving people the opportunity to attend from a distance.\\\"While some people want as many friends and family as possible to be able to see their loved one's funeral, and others want their remains to be put to good use, a few of us want something more dramatic to happen to our ashes.This is certainly offered by US firm Celestis, which for the past 20 years has been sending ashes into outer space.Hitching a ride on space missions, it allows people to send their ashes into orbit and beyond.Charles Chafer, Celestis' co-founder and chief executive, says that thanks to the development of commercial space operators, such as Elon Musk's SpaceX, \\\"we're now launching two to three times a year... [and] in the next five years I think we'll get to at least a quarterly pace.\\\"","postDate":"2021-05-02T23:02:00.000Z","title":"'More and more people don't want a traditional burial' - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56926819"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/88E1\/production\/_118414053_eoghanharris.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"Columnist Eoghan Harris has had his contract terminated by Ireland's Sunday Independent newspaper over his role in a fake Twitter account.The account, set up in February 2020 under the name Barbara J Pym, posted about aspects of Irish politics.The journalist and former Irish senator confirmed his involvement, in an interview with RTÉ.Mr Harris has often commented about Northern Ireland and is a long-time critic of Sinn Féin.He told RTÉ Drivetime that he was one of the founders of the Twitter account, but in recent times he had \\\"moved to the background as more of an advisor\\\".He said there were six people in total involved in tweeting from the account but the other contributors wished to remain anonymous as they were \\\"nervous of Sinn Féin\\\".Describing the account as \\\"generally benign\\\", Mr Harris said it only criticised people who were \\\"Sinn Féin enablers or pawns\\\".The Barbara J Pym account is currently suspended.Sunday Independent editor Alan English told the Irish Independent that the paper encourages \\\"the expression of strong, sharp and diverse opinions in the Sunday Independent and Eoghan Harris's column has been a must-read for a great number of readers for a considerable time\\\".He added: \\\"However, his position as a columnist became untenable when Eoghan confirmed to us this week that he has had an involvement in the operation of a fake Twitter account.\\\"Regardless of where they stand on any issue, we expect our writers to put their views across in a transparent manner.

There were no reports of injuries or damage.It said debris from the 18-tonne rocket, one of the largest items in decades to have an undirected dive into the atmosphere, landed in the Indian Ocean at a point 72.47° East and 2.65° North.US Space Command, meanwhile, simply said the rocket had \\\"re-entered over the Arabian Peninsula\\\". It did not confirm the landing point reported by Chinese media, saying instead that it was \\\"unknown if the debris [had] impacted land or water\\\".The monitoring service Space-Track, which uses US military data, said the rocket was recorded above Saudi Arabia before it fell into the Indian Ocean near the Maldives.The uncontrolled return of the rocket led to pointed criticism from the US amid fears that it could land in an inhabited area. US and European websites tracked its return, and there was much speculation on social media about where the debris might land.\\\"Spacefaring nations must minimise the risks to people and property on Earth,\\\" US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement. \\\"It is clear that China is failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris.\\\"Space experts, however, predicted that the chances of anyone being hit were very small, not least because so much of the Earth's surface is covered by ocean and huge areas of land are uninhabited.The main segment from the Long March-5b vehicle was used to launch the first module of China's new space station last month.Originally injected into an elliptical orbit approximately 160km by 375km (99 miles by 233 miles) above the Earth's surface on 29 April, the Long March-5b core stage soon began to lose height.Various space debris modelling experts predicted that most of the vehicle would burn up during its final plunge through the atmosphere, although there was always the possibility that metals with high melting points and other resistant materials could survive to the Earth's surface.When a similar core stage returned to Earth a year ago, piping assumed to be from the rocket was identified on the ground in Ivory Coast in West Africa.China has bridled at the suggestion that it has been negligent in allowing the uncontrolled return of so large an object.Commentary in the country's media had described Western reports about the potential hazards involved as \\\"hype\\\" and predicted the debris would fall somewhere in international waters.In recent years, China has made no secret of its space ambitions.The country has poured billions of dollars into its space efforts, and in 2019 it became the first country to send an uncrewed rover to the far side of the Moon.President Xi Jinping has also thrown his support behind the endeavours and state media has frequently cast the \\\"space dream\\\" as one step in the path to \\\"national rejuvenation\\\".The Tiangong space station could be up and running as early as next year - and there is also talk in Chinese media of missions to Mars and a potential shared lunar station with Russia.You might also be interested in:","postDate":"2021-05-09T09:44:37.000Z","title":"Chinese rocket debris crashes into Indian Ocean - state media - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-57045058"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/C0F2\/production\/_105649394_0f29c1a3-49df-4a05-90a1-56eaedd0e7c7.jpg","author":"By Victoria Gill","description":"The first bottles of an \\\"artisanal spirit\\\" made using apples grown near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have been seized by Ukrainian authorities.The Chernobyl Spirit Company said 1,500 bottles of Atomik alcoholic drink were confiscated on 19 March and taken to the Kyiv Prosecutor's office.Officers took the shipment from a truck at a distillery in the Carpathians.The spirit, its producers say, is Chernobyl's first consumer product since the 1986 nuclear disaster.They are now awaiting the outcome of an investigation by the Ukrainian security services but say they have \\\"no idea\\\" why the shipment, which was destined for the UK, was seized.\\\"It seems that they are accusing us of using forged Ukrainian excise stamps,\\\" explained Prof Jim Smith, a scientist who has spent many years studying the exclusion zone before setting up the Chernobyl Spirit Company with Ukrainian colleagues. \\\"But this doesn't make sense since the bottles are for the UK market and are clearly labelled with valid UK excise stamps.\\\"The social enterprise company that makes Atomik is run by scientists who work in the 4,000 square kilometre Chernobyl exclusion zone - an area abandoned after the catastrophic 1986 nuclear disaster. Their studies have included growing experimental crops to find out if grain, and other food grown in the zone, could be used to make products that are safe to consume.Part of the reason for producing the spirit was to demonstrate how land around the exclusion zone could be put back to productive use. The researchers say this could allow communities there to grow and sell produce - something that is currently illegal on \\\"officially contaminated land\\\".When we tasted the first Atomik vodka martini in 2019, Prof Smith, who is based at Portsmouth University, explained that it was \\\"no more radioactive than any other vodka\\\".Prof Smith and his colleagues since adjusted their recipe to make an apple-based spirit. Those apples are grown in the Narodichi district - an area immediately outside the exclusion zone, where agriculture and development is still highly restricted.The company plans to use some of its profits to help communities in Ukraine - including in Narodichi - that are still affected by the economic impact of the nuclear disaster.BBC News contacted the Kyiv prosecutor's office for comment but, at the time of writing, has not received a response.Dr Gennady Laptev, one of the company's co-owners and a Chernobyl \\\"liquidator\\\" who worked there in the first weeks after the accident, said: \\\"We hope this issue can be resolved so that we can continue our work trying to help people affected by the devastating social and economic impacts Chernobyl had on communities.\\\"Follow Victoria on Twitter","postDate":"2021-05-08T08:57:17.000Z","title":"Chernobyl alcohol drink seized by authorities - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-57011695"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/64BE\/production\/_118409752_hi067163010.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"One of the UK's rarest fish is getting a chance to return to its historical breeding grounds on the River Severn.The little-known twaite shad, a member of the herring family, was once common in British waters with thousands of the fish migrating upstream in spring.Numbers dwindled after weirs constructed in the 19th Century posed barriers to migratory fish.A conservation project is trying to unlock the river for fish by creating routes around several weirs.It is hoped the move will benefit a host of species including salmon, lamprey and eels.This month could see the return of the twaite shad to stretches of the river north of Worcester.Volunteers are being sought to listen out for the distinctive splashing sounds the fish make when they breed at night.Jason Leach, programme director at the Canal & River Trust, said: \\\"It's never too late to give nature the chance to recover.\\\"Our project's night-time riverside spawning vigils are a fitting way to begin recording the recovery of the fish affected so badly when our predecessors inadvertently caused a big problem for migratory fish by the building of the weirs.\\\"We hope lots of volunteers will be inspired to join us to witness and record the spring shad-spawning phenomenon.\\\"The Unlocking The Severn project by the Canal & River Trust, Severn Rivers Trust, Environment Agency and Natural England is in the process of reopening 150 miles (241km) of the river for the fish.Two specially constructed passes beside Victorian-era weirs at Diglis and Bevere, near Worcester, have been completed.A study by Swansea University estimates that 99% of the UK's rivers are fragmented by barriers such as weirs, dams, hydropower structures and culverts.The high number of barriers make it difficult for migratory fish to complete their journeys to reproduce and find food.\\\"If you imagine a fish that is 10cm long, then a barrier that is even under 50cm high is going to prevent that fish from moving up and down the river to different bits of habitat where it might feed or spawn,\\\" said researcher Dr Joshua Jones.","postDate":"2021-05-06T23:16:40.000Z","title":"Rare fish set for return to River Severn breeding grounds - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-57016998"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/180CF\/production\/_118411589_china.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"China emits more greenhouse gas than the entire developed world combined, a new report has claimed.The research by Rhodium Group says China emitted 27% of the world's greenhouse gases in 2019.The US was the second-largest emitter at 11% while India was third with 6.6% of emissions, the think tank said.Scientists warn that without an agreement between the US and China it will be hard to avert dangerous climate change.China's emissions more than tripled over the previous three decades, the report from the US-based Rhodium Group added.The Asian giant has the world's largest population, so its per person emissions are still far behind the US, but the research said those emissions have increased too, tripling over the course of two decades.China has vowed to reach net-zero emissions by 2060 with a peak no later than 2030.President Xi Jinping reiterated his pledge at a climate summit organised by US President Joe Biden last month.\\\"This major strategic decision is made based on our sense of responsibility to build a community with a shared future for mankind and our own need to secure sustainable development,\\\" President Xi said at the time.However, China is heavily reliant on coal power.The country is currently running 1,058 coal plants - more than half the world's capacity.Under the Paris accord, agreed in 2015, 197 nations pledged to limit global warming to below 2C. However, the world is far from meeting that commitment.Central to the Paris Agreement are Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). These are targets intended to cut emissions.NDCs represent the commitments by each country - under the Paris pact - to reduce their own national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.According to the Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific analysis that tracks government climate action, China's NDC rating is \\\"highly insufficient\\\" and \\\"are not at all consistent with holding warming to below 2C\\\".President Biden's climate envoy, John Kerry travelled to China last month to meet counterparts and discuss how to work together to combat climate change, despite diplomatic tensions between the two countries on a range of other issues.In a joint statement, the two sides committed to working together and with other countries on tackling climate change including specific action on emissions.Leaders will come together for COP26 - a crucial climate change summit - in November in Glasgow, UK to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement.","postDate":"2021-05-07T04:52:05.000Z","title":"Report: China emissions exceed all developed nations combined - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-57018837"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/6977\/production\/_118399962_c0485029-methane_bubbles_in_thermokarst_lake_ice.jpg","author":"By Justin Rowlatt","description":"Reducing emissions of methane gas is vital for tackling climate change in the short-term, a major UN report says.Methane is produced when living things decompose; it's also in natural gas.It persists for just a short time in the atmosphere - unlike carbon dioxide - but methane is a much more potent global warming gas than CO2.The report says \\\"urgent steps\\\" are necessary in order to reduce methane if global warming is to be kept within a limit laid down in the Paris deal.This agreement, signed by 200 countries, aims to keep the global temperature rise to within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century.The 1.5C target is regarded as the gateway to \\\"dangerous\\\" warming, where the planet could experience serious adverse effects of climate change.The report comes as data showed both CO2 and methane (CH4) in the atmosphere reached record highs last year.This happened despite pandemic lockdowns, which massively reduced economic activity.The good news is that the UN report says rapid and significant reductions in the greenhouse gas are possible using existing technologies and a very low cost.Methane is also a source for another gas - ozone - in the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere (known as the troposphere)In addition to saving money, cutting methane would yield significant health benefits by reducing the amount of ground-level ozone - a pollutant that's harmful to the human body.The recommendations come from an international team of scientists, who have produced the Global Methane Assessment for the UN Environment Programme (Unep).Drew Shindell, the study's lead author, and a professor of Earth science at Duke University in Durham, US, agrees CO2 is the number one target in the fight against climate change, but says cutting methane will have a more rapid impact.\\\"So many aspects of climate change are happening faster than expected\\\", he said. \\\"We see more fires, more of the strongest hurricanes, more heatwaves, and methane is the best lever we have to reduce the growth in those over the next 30 years.\\\"Scientists regard a temperature rise of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as a gateway to \\\"dangerous\\\" warming of the planet. The Paris agreement, signed by nearly 200 countries, aims to keep the increase to within the 1.5C target.The new report says measures available now could reduce emissions from human activities by as much as 180 million tonnes a year by 2030 - 45% of the total per year.The main sources of human-related methane are the fossil fuel industry, which accounts for 34% of total emissions, agriculture which contributes another 40% and the waste sector 20%.One of the difficulties in tackling the methane problem has been knowing precisely where the gas is coming from. But this is changing thanks to an emerging satellite capability that can pinpoint sources. The Canadian company GHGSat has the highest-resolution instrument in orbit currently, able to detect plumes of CH4 down to about 25m across.In the example above, the technology is tracking emissions from a giant landfill area serving the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. The area is outputting 16 tonnes of CH4 every hour, equivalent to nearly 400 tonnes\\\/hr of CO2.On an annualised basis, this is like the greenhouse gas output of 750,000 cars driving for a year. GHGSat's spacecraft are being followed by a fleet of other methane-detecting satellites this decade. Identifying super-emitters is about to get a lot easier.The Unep report says the fossil fuel industry has the greatest potential for low-cost methane cuts.Plugging leaks in oil and gas wells and along production and transmission lines would significantly cut methane emissions at little to no cost, it concludes.Many of the reductions could quickly pay for themselves because reducing leaks means more gas available for sale.But the report warns the continued expansion of the use of natural gas is not compatible with keeping warming to 1.5C without what it calls \\\"massive-scale deployment of unproven carbon removal technologies\\\".The waste sector could cut its methane emissions by improving the disposal of sewage around the world.Improving the management of rice paddies has the potential to reduce emissions from agriculture but the report says the biggest generators of agricultural methane - livestock - are harder to abate.There is little scope for technical solutions, it concludes, so the effort needs to be focused on reducing food waste and loss, improving livestock management and encouraging consumers to adopt what the report calls \\\"healthier diets\\\" - those with a lower meat and dairy content.If a concerted effort managed to achieve that 45% cut in methane emissions, it would help avoid nearly 0.3C of global warming as early as the 2040s, the report claims.Because of methane's contribution to the formation of ozone, up to a quarter of a million premature deaths could be avoided worldwide under the most aggressive emission abatement efforts.This attempt to focus on the issue of methane is very welcome, said Myles Allen, professor of geosystem science at Oxford University, provided it does not distract from the need to reduce CO2 emissions to net zero as soon as possible.Prof Euan Nisbet, from the greenhouse gas group at Royal Holloway, University of London, said: \\\"The actions it suggests, like cutting gas leaks and landfill emissions, are sensible, cost-effective and economically realistic. If fully implemented, these relatively inexpensive measures will help avoid nearly 0.3C of warming by mid-century.\\\"Follow Justin on Twitter.","postDate":"2021-05-06T15:30:12.000Z","title":"Cutting methane gas 'crucial for climate fight' - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-56933443"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/8A30\/production\/_118267353_climatemarchnysep2020-1228629969.jpg","author":"By Helen Briggs","description":"Young activists are breathing new life into the long-running debate over climate justice - the framing of global warming as an ethical issue rather than a purely environmental one.When world leaders took to the (virtual) stage at President Biden's climate summit, they were given a gentle telling off by 19-year-old climate activist, Xiye Bastida.\\\"Solutions must be aligned with the fact that climate justice is social justice,\\\" she said, echoing the words of Greta Thunberg.The Mexican-born teenager is among a new generation of climate activists drawing attention to environmental and social injustices they say are blighting lives worldwide.Her words cut through the noise in a video that has been viewed more than a quarter of a million times.Harriet Lamb of the climate solutions charity, Ashden, says people have been talking about the problem of climate injustice for decades but young activists are giving it new momentum.\\\"It has undoubtedly changed the agenda,\\\" she says.For her, climate justice is about making sure we address historic injustices over emissions, including the carbon footprint of the wealthy, whose lifestyles have contributed most to global warming.At the same time, climate change is predominantly impacting those who've done the least to contribute to carbon pollution and who have the least resources to deal with it because they are living below the poverty line.The starkest inequalities are seen in the poorest countries of the world, where people leaving only a tiny carbon footprint are at the front line of climate chaos, from floods to ruined crops. But even in wealthy countries like the UK, there are warnings of carbon inequality.Amy Norman, a researcher at the think-tank, The Social Market Foundation, says politicians need to level with voters on what the transition to net zero will mean for the way we live.There's potential for a public and political backlash over issues of unfairness, she says, which could damage trust and ultimately the wider transition to net zero (removing as many emissions as we produce).\\\"This is an entire economical, societal shift and transition that we need to make,\\\" she says.\\\"Politicians need to have the public on board and bringing them alongside - if you're hitting lower incomes where it hurts with their finances you're going to lose support quickly and especially if that's seen to be unfair.\\\"Anyone driving around in a clapped-out car they rely on for the school run might well wonder how to afford a shiny new electric car. And if you live in a tower block, where would you even charge one? And those dreading a hefty bill to fix a faulty boiler will be shuddering at the thought of an expensive heat pump.These are some of the issues politicians must wrestle with as they work out how to deliver on their promises for curbing emissions.Amy Norman says there needs to be a package of support for low-income households to help meet the costs of electric vehicles and funding for local authorities to install public charging points.Issues of climate justice are thrown into even sharper relief when looking at emissions through a global lens.Studies show that the combined emissions of the richest 1% of the global population account for more than the poorest 50%.The global south will bear the brunt of economic impacts from rising temperatures, with those on lower incomes more vulnerable to the likes of floods, drought and extreme heat.In Nigeria, for instance, the poorest 20% of people are 50% more likely to be affected by a flood, 130% more likely to be affected by a drought, and 80% more likely to be affected by a heat wave than the average Nigerian. And in Bangladesh, India, and Honduras, poor people are losing two to three times more than the wealthy when hit by a flood or storm.One recent study found that enacting policies to fight climate change will push an additional 50 million people into poverty by 2030.Study researcher, Dr Bjoern Soergel of Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, says the drive towards net zero could mean higher prices for food and energy, which will have a greater impact on the poor.But he says there is a \\\"win-win\\\" situation by which you can protect the climate and reduce extreme poverty. This would involve carbon pricing - essentially a carbon tax on polluting fossil fuels - with governments re-distributing some of the profits on a per capita basis.Richer countries would then need to give a fraction of the money to the countries where people live in extreme poverty.\\\"Making [climate policies] in an equitable way really needs to be at the core of climate action first of all because the currently rich industrialised countries are responsible for the large majority of emissions in the past,\\\" he says.\\\"They have contributed most to the issue so far. But also they have the biggest means to tackle the problem both in terms of financial resources and technology.\\\"Harriet Lamb says there is a danger that measures designed to encourage cleaner, greener living might exacerbate existing socio-economic divisions and derail the drive towards a net zero world.\\\"We have to have exactly the right policies that tackle climate inequalities and social inequalities at the same time because the two are absolutely intertwined,\\\" she says.And while people have been talking about the problem of climate injustice for decades, young activists are now giving it new momentum.\\\"This is not David against Goliath, which is the cliché representation of so much of civil society, this is Goliath slugging it out against Goliath,\\\" she says.\\\"I would not say the battle is yet won for those pushing for the dramatic action we need to ensure we do see climate justice but I would say the scales are beginning to tip.\\\"Follow Helen on Twitter.","postDate":"2021-05-02T23:45:44.000Z","title":"Carbon: How calls for climate justice are shaking the world - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-56941979"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/1555\/production\/_110116450_gettyimages-93066205.jpg","author":"By Mark Kinver","description":"In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. Here, we look at the effects of global heating on Victoria Falls, one of the natural wonders of the world - and how Sub-Saharan Africa is learning to cope with the climate crisis.In full flow, Victoria Falls easily qualifies as one of the natural wonders of the world. Spanning 1.7km at its widest point and with a height of more than 100m, locals refer to Africa's greatest waterfall as \\\"the smoke that thunders\\\".This amazing feature is formed as the Zambezi river plunges into a chasm called the First Gorge. The chasm was carved by the action of water along a natural fracture zone in the volcanic rock that makes up the landscape in this region of southern Africa.In 2019, however, Victoria Falls was silenced.In a drought described as the worst in a century, the flow of the Zambezi was reduced to a relative trickle and the Falls ran dry.As one of the region's biggest attractions for tourists, Victoria Falls is a valuable source of income for Zimbabwe and Zambia. As news of the low waters spread, local traders noticed a visible drop in tourist numbers.As well as hitting the countries' economies, it also hit electricity supplies, which are dependent on hydroelectric generation.More widely across the region, agencies reported an increase in the need for food aid, as crops failed in the drought.'Stark reminder'A single extreme weather event cannot, in isolation, be viewed as a consequence of climate change.But the region is recording a sequence of extreme droughts that reflect what climate modellers have predicted will occur as a result of an increase in greenhouse gases in the world's atmosphere as a result of human activity.Zambia's President, Edgar Lungu - speaking at the time - called it \\\"a stark reminder of what climate change is doing to our environment\\\".Observers of weather patterns in the Zambezi Basin believe the changing climate is resulting in a delay to the monsoon season, concentrating the rains into bigger, more intense events.This makes the storage of the water in the region more difficult, and makes the impact of the extended dry season more damaging to people and the environment.The UN's State of the Climate in Africa in 2019 report painted a worrying picture for a continent that could see its population double over the coming century.Speaking at the report's launch in October 2020, World Meteorological Organization secretary-general Petteri Taalas observed: \\\"Climate change is having a growing impact on the African continent, hitting the most vulnerable hardest, and contributing to food insecurity, population displacement and stress on water resources.\\\"In recent months, we have seen devastating floods, an invasion of desert locusts and now face the looming spectre of drought because of a La Niña event.\\\"The report adds that 2019 was among the three warmest years on record for the continent.It warns that the warming trend is expected to continue.The worrying fact facing politicians, policymakers and civil society is that the continent is set to be hardest hit by climate change, yet the continent's capacity to adapt to the realities of a warming world are low.Areas of concern include water supplies, health, food security, droughts and floods, biodiversity. It is a list of concerns that is continuing to grow.Africa is on the front line of the battle against dangerous climate change.Our Planet Then and Now will continue each month up to the UN climate summit in Glasgow, which is scheduled to start in November 2021","postDate":"2021-05-01T23:10:52.000Z","title":"Then and now: When silence descended over Victoria Falls - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-56902340"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/12614\/production\/_118248257_pataniaiiatsurface.jpg","author":"By David Shukman","description":"A prototype deep sea mining machine is lying stranded on the floor of the Pacific Ocean.The 25-tonne un-crewed device became detached from the cable linking it to a ship at the surface.The accident happened halfway through a month-long programme of trials and research.It comes amid heightened controversy over plans to mine the minerals contained in the seabed.The robotic machine, known as Patania II, was developed by GSR, a Belgian company, to collect small rocks known as nodules.It was deployed in an area of the Pacific licensed to GSR for exploration - several dozen zones have been earmarked to companies and governments in this way.The first phase of trials was almost complete when the umbilical cable became detached from its connection to the machine.A spokesman for GSR told BBC News: \\\"On its final dive in the GSR area, a lifting point separated and Patania II now stands on the seafloor.\\\"An operation to reconnect the lifting point begins this evening and we will provide an update in due course.\\\"If the machine is successfully retrieved, it will be redeployed for further research in an area licensed to Germany.But recovery in such extreme depths cannot be guaranteed.The incident happened a few days ago and the news was just broken by Greenpeace which has been monitoring the activities of deep sea mining companies.Dr Sandra Schoettner, a deep-sea biologist from Greenpeace Germany, who's on board the Rainbow Warrior ship in the Pacific Ocean, said: \\\"It's ironic that an industry that wants to extract metals from the seabed ends up dropping it down there instead.\\\"This glaring operational failure must act as a stark warning that deep sea mining is too big a risk. Losing control of a 25-tonne mining machine at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean should sink the idea of ever mining the deep sea.\\\"Two years ago, the same company had to stop trials of a smaller prototype after damage to its umbilical cable.Clearly, there are serious technological challenges to operating in the pitch-black depths.Another mining machine, Apollo II, designed by a Dutch company, was battered by rocks, sand and turbulence even in shallow waters off Spain two years ago.The goal is to extract valuable metals such as cobalt and nickel, which are important for low-carbon technologies including electric cars.Earlier this month, BMW, Volvo, Samsung and Google declared that they would join a moratorium on deep ocean metals until the risks to the environment are better understood.Follow David on Twitter.","postDate":"2021-04-28T18:47:41.000Z","title":"Accident leaves deep sea mining machine stranded - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-56921773"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/409A\/production\/_118383561_landing.jpg","author":"Jonathan Amos","description":"Step by step, the SpaceX company is progressing the development of its novel Starship rocket.The latest prototype, Serial Number 15 (SN15), has just completed a successful high-altitude ascent and landing.The four previous test artefacts all ran into trouble as they went through their touchdown manoeuvres, ultimately destroying themselves in the process.But SN15 had no such difficulty, making a tidy, controlled return to the ground at SpaceX's R&D facility in Texas.A small fire licked around the base of the vehicle on touchdown but was soon extinguished.There's considerable interest in the Starship concept now that the American space agency (Nasa) has chosen it to land astronauts on the Moon later this decade.For SpaceX, lunar missions would be just one application of many for the new system.The expectation is that Starships will replace the company's Falcon rockets.These existing vehicles carry out regular missions - both crewed and uncrewed - for Nasa, as well as satellite deployments for the US military and other commercial operators.But SpaceX CEO, Elon Musk, believes the new 50m-tall Starship can do it all, bigger and better - and not just at Earth; he says the technology will get people to Mars.Wednesday's test proceeded much like the previous prototype flights.The uncrewed SN15 left its launch mount at the Boca Chica facility, and rose vertically on the thrust of three methane-burning Raptor engines.These power units shut down in sequence as the target height of roughly 10km (6.2 miles) was approached, with the vehicle then leaning over into the horizontal for the drop to the ground.This belly-flop descent, controlled by large flaps at either end of the vehicle, is intended to simulate how future, operational Starships will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere from orbit, presenting a large surface area to the direction of travel to scrub off speed.The vehicle is supposed to transition back to a tail-down configuration just before reaching the surface.SN8, SN9, SN10 and SN11 couldn't manage the process cleanly and were destroyed just before, at, or shortly after the moment of touchdown.SN15, in contrast, made a perfect flip back to the vertical and set itself down gently on its stubby legs.SpaceX has more prototypes in various stages of readiness. It is iterating the design, making upgrades as engineers learn how to build and fly the rockets.Operational Starships will eventually launch atop a booster called Super Heavy.This will feature perhaps 28 Raptors, producing more than 70 meganewtons (16 million lbs) of thrust - about double that of the mighty Apollo Saturn 5 rocket, which sent men to the Moon.","postDate":"2021-05-05T23:54:55.000Z","title":"SpaceX Starship prototype makes clean landing - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-57004604"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/624\/cpsprodpb\/4BEB\/production\/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png","author":"Unknown","description":"Four astronauts have returned to Earth from the International Space Station, in what was Nasa's first night-time landing in 53 years.The crew - three Nasa astronauts and one from Japan's space agency Jaxa - spent almost six months in space.They flew back in SpaceX's Crew Dragon Resilience and splash-landed off Panama City, Florida at 02:56 EDT (07:56 BST).They were supposed to leave the ISS earlier, but their departure was delayed due to bad weather in Florida.Nasa said the crew were in good spirits after successfully landing in the Gulf of Mexico.Speaking at a press conference after the landing, a SpaceX crew operations and resources engineer told the astronauts: \\\"Dragon, on behalf of Nasa and SpaceX teams, we welcome you back to planet Earth and thanks for flying SpaceX. For those of you enrolled in our frequent flier programme, you've earned 68 million miles on this voyage.\\\"Nasa astronaut Michael Hopkins, commander of the Crew-1 mission, replied: \\\"It is good to be back on planet Earth. We'll take those miles. Are they transferable?\\\"Confirming the safe landing on Sunday morning, Nasa said the crew were given medical checks before being flown from Pensacola, Florida to Houston, Texas.The last Nasa crew to land back on Earth at night-time was Apollo-8 - the first manned mission to the moon, which returned on 27 December 1968.This latest mission was a collaboration between Nasa and SpaceX, as part of the former's Commercial Crew programme.SpaceX, owned by Elon Musk, has become Nasa's favoured commercial space flight partner.Nasa livestreamed the moment the capsule left the ISS, moved off into the dark and began its journey back to Earth.There are still seven astronauts on the ISS, including a new crew of four people who arrived on a different SpaceX craft last week on a mission called Crew-2.As the capsule moved off, Mr Hopkins said: \\\"Thanks for your hospitality. We'll see you back on Earth.\\\"The astronauts - Hopkins, Victor Glover, Shannon Walker and Soichi Noguchi - travelled into space last November on the first fully operational mission to the ISS by a vehicle made by SpaceX.Glover also made history with this mission, by becoming the first black person to hold a long-duration crew assignment on the ISS.Speaking at a remote press conference before the crew's return to Earth, he said: \\\"One thing that did really profoundly impact me was the very first time I got out of the seat after [the spacecraft] was safely in orbit, and I looked out the window and saw the earth from 250 miles up.\\\"I will never forget that moment... It wasn't about the view. It was how the view made me feel.\\\"In May 2020, two US astronauts made a test mission to the ISS and stayed until July. This mission, Demo-2, was SpaceX's first astronaut mission.That was also the first launch to the ISS from US soil since the end of the Space Shuttle programme in 2011. Since then, the US had relied the Russian Soyuz spacecraft to send astronauts to the space station.It was also the first crewed mission run by a private company and not Nasa.","postDate":"2021-05-02T14:46:06.000Z","title":"Nasa astronauts splash-land on Earth in SpaceX capsule after ISS mission - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-56962120"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/B260\/production\/_118246654_494ab369-8030-4eae-82fb-0eecc3424d91.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"Michael Collins - one of the three crew members of the first manned mission to land on the Moon, Apollo 11 in 1969 - has died aged 90, his family say.He died on Wednesday after \\\"a valiant battle with cancer.

Collins remained in the command module throughout the mission.Armstrong's words, beamed to the world by TV, entered history: \\\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\\\"About 400,000 people worked on the programme, at a cost at the time of $25bn.The crew returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on 24 July.An estimated 650 million people worldwide watched the Moon landing.

It was only in 2003 that it sent its first astronaut into orbit, making it the third country to do so, after the Soviet Union and the US.So far, China has sent two previous space stations into orbit. The Tiangong-1 and Tiangong-2 were trial stations though, simple modules that allowed only relatively short stays by astronauts.The new, 66-tonne, multi-module Tiangong station is set to be operational for at least 10 years.Tianhe is the core component of it. It is 16.6m long and 4.2m wide. It will provide power and propulsion and contains the life support technologies and living quarters required by visiting astronauts.Beijing plans to have at least 10 more similar launches, carrying all the additional equipment into orbit, before the completion of the station next year. It will orbit Earth at an altitude of 340 to 450km (210-280 miles).The only current space station in orbit is the ISS which is a collaboration between Russia, the US, Canada, Europe and Japan. China has been blocked from participating in it.The ISS is due to be retired after 2024, which could potentially leave Tiangong as the only space station in Earth's orbit.China's space programme has become a regular feature in the country's propaganda videos and, in a way, why wouldn't it?After a high-speed catch up with other nations, it now has bold ambitions beyond Earth.Having been frozen out of the International Space Station programme by the US, Beijing just decided to build its own.When the Tiangong station is up and running - possibly as early as next year - though it will be only a quarter of the size of the international facility, no other country will have its own orbiting space lab.There is talk here of missions to Mars and a lunar station with Russia.The comparison with the Cold War space race is clearly there to be made: legitimate scientific ambitions mixed up with international mistrust, the potential militarisation of space and key projects being hailed as new benchmarks to justify the enormous amounts of money being spent.China's 'space dream'Chen Lan, an analyst who specialises in China's space programme, had told news agency AFP that the project was a \\\"big deal\\\".\\\"This will be the largest international space co-operation project for China, so it's significant,\\\" he said.China has in recent years made no secret of its space ambitions.China has poured significant funding into its space efforts, and in 2019 became the first country to send an uncrewed rover to the far side of the Moon.President Xi Jinping has also thrown his support behind the country's space endeavours and the Chinese state media regularly cast the \\\"space dream\\\" as one step in the path to \\\"national rejuvenation\\\".","postDate":"2021-04-29T07:19:38.000Z","title":"China launches first module of new space station - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-china-56924370"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/73DA\/production\/_118285692_whatsubject.jpg","author":"By Rebecca Morelle","description":"The US space agency has announced it is extending its Mars helicopter mission.Nasa said the first three flights of the drone, called Ingenuity, had worked so well it would now be moving from a demonstration to an operational phase.This means the chopper will support Nasa\\u2019s Perseverance Rover, helping with its hunt for signs of life.The new phase will last for another 30 Martian days - or Sols - but the team said it was hopeful the operational role could be extended further.\\u201CThe technical performance has been fantastic and it is exceeding all our expectations,\\u201D said MiMi Aung, Ingenuity\\u2019s project manager.\\u201CI can't tell you how excited we are about this new phase.\\u201DIngenuity\\u2019s flight on 19 April made history as the first powered, controlled flight on another planet.The 1.8kg chopper lifted off in the extremely thin Martian atmosphere and hovered at a height of 2m for about 40 seconds before landing.For its second and third flights, it flew further afield, rising to a height of 5m before speeding off laterally for 2m and 50m before returning to its landing spot.Nasa\\u2019s original plan was to then carry out two more flights, before grounding Ingenuity to bring the technology demonstration to a close.But Friday's announcement is a change of course. The US space agency said it was so pleased with the helicopter\\u2019s performance, it wanted to explore Ingenuity's capabilities in a new way.Bob Balaram, Ingenuity\\u2019s chief engineer, said: \\u201CIt's been riding the winds, it's been taking off great, all the engineering systems, the solar panel, the battery, the radio have all been working very well - everything has just been fantastic.\\\"Now, Ingenuity will be helping out with the rover's science programme.It will work with the Perseverance robot as it starts to investigate Jezero Crater, a region of Mars that was once a lake.The rover will be looking for rock samples that it can study with its onboard instruments and tools. Its ultimate aim is to find signs of life.In the helicopter's new operational phase, it will fly up to a kilometre ahead of the rover, scouting for promising geological features and exploring areas that Perseverance cannot reach.It will also make digital elevation maps, helping scientists to better understand the terrain.The hope is this will demonstrate how aerial mobility could help future missions.The helicopter's fourth flight, which took place on Friday, begins the transition to the operational phase.The plan was a 266m-round trip and for the helicopter to take 60 black-and-white images and five colour images, and Nasa has confirmed the helicopter flew further and faster than ever before.This data will help the team to locate a new flight field, and on its next flight, in about a week's time, the helicopter will head there so the next stage of its mission can begin.Nasa is hopeful the helicopter will perform well, but acknowledges the next phase will push the helicopter to its limits - it was only ever built to fly as a tech demo.\\\"We will now be flying over unsurveyed terrains and transfer to airfields that are not well characterised so there's a higher probability of a bad landing,\\\" explained MiMi Aung.\\\"We will be celebrating each day that ingenuity survives and operates beyond the original window.\\\"Follow Rebecca on Twitter..","postDate":"2021-04-30T19:44:15.000Z","title":"Mars Ingenuity helicopter mission extended by Nasa - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-56951752"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/640\/cpsprodpb\/11173\/production\/_118230007_rock-scalebar-nc.png","author":"Jonathan Amos","description":"It's an unassuming rock, greenish in colour, and just over 4cm in its longest dimension. And yet this little piece of sandstone holds important clues to all our futures.It was recovered from muds in the deep ocean, far off the coast of modern-day West Antarctica.The scientists who found it say it shouldn't really have been there.It's what's called a dropstone, a piece of ice-rafted debris.It was scraped off the White Continent by a glacier, carried a certain distance in this flowing ice, and then exported and discarded offshore by an iceberg.What's remarkable about this particular cobble is that researchers can say where it originated.Using the latest \\\"geo-fingerprinting\\\" techniques, they've established with strong confidence that it comes from the Ellsworth Mountains - some 1,300km from where the rock was pulled up from the floor of the Amundsen Sea by a drilling ship.The conundrum is that the Ellsworths - the tallest range in Antarctica - are in the far-interior of the continent, and it's highly unlikely a rock like this could survive being ferried so far under an ice sheet to get to the coast to be then despatched in a large, frozen, floating block.\\\"In our view of observations of that material, it would not withstand a great deal of transport, with deposition and then re-transport over multiple steps of a cycle. And, furthermore, it probably would not hold up well to a great deal of interaction between the ice sheet and the bedrock. It would be destroyed and disaggregated,\\\" Christine Siddoway, professor of geology at Colorado College, US, told BBC News.So how did it get to travel so far? The answer is in the age of the deposits collected by the Joides Resolution ship on its International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) \\\"Expedition 379\\\" cruise in 2019.They're mid-Pliocene in the geologists' timeline. That's about three million years ago.The mid-Pliocene is a fascinating period in Earth history because of its strong echoes of today. It was the last time the atmosphere carried the same concentration of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide - at over 400 parts per million.Temperatures back then were significantly warmer, perhaps by 2-3 degrees globally, and sea-levels were also higher, possibly by as much as 10-20m above the modern ocean surface.And this is where our small green sandstone rock comes into the story.Those mid-Pliocene sea-levels imply the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, or at least significant parts of it, had melted away - and that in its place was a large open seaway.This is hard to imagine when you look at maps of Antarctica today; we view its ice covering as a continuous solid mass. But take the ice off and you are essentially left with a great archipelago - a series of major islands.It explains how the cobble could travel so far.Glacier ice at the Ellsworth Mountains picked it up and then produced an iceberg locally to float it more than a thousand kilometres across the open seaway to drop it in the place Expedition 379 eventually recovered it.\\\"Our findings do confirm that the ice sheet can disappear fairly rapidly and also that it can re-establish itself fairly readily,\\\" explained Prof Siddoway.\\\"We read from very detailed records - that we're striving to make even more detailed - that the ice sheet has collapsed back in a considerable extent, specifically in the middle Pliocene.\\\"This is an interval, if we read current literature from climate modellers, that we may be entering... The climate conditions of the Pliocene are what we are expected to enter. And if warming continues at the rate that it is now, we may stay there.\\\"No-one expects the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to collapse anytime soon, but the little sandstone cobble is a warning, scientists believe, of the conditions we could eventually re-create if we don't soon get on top of the climate crisis.Prof Siddoway presented details of the IODP Expedition 379 research at this week's European Geosciences Union (EGU) General Assembly. Normally held in Vienna, Austria, #vEGU21 has been convened online this year because of Covid restrictions.","postDate":"2021-04-28T09:16:46.000Z","title":"Climate change: A small green rock's warning about our future - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-56904548"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/64C5\/production\/_118279752_c0138401-tawny_frogmouth.jpg","author":"By Victoria Gill","description":"You don't often read the word \\\"instagrammable\\\" in a scientific paper.But a recently published study that asked \\\"what makes a great bird photo?\\\" has officially deemed the frogmouth the most instagrammable of avians.The result led the researchers to use another term that I have seldom read in an academic study: \\\"poetic justice\\\". The frogmouth was once designated \\\"the world's most unfortunate-looking bird\\\".It has now been redeemed by Instagram's millions of animal photography fans.The result surprised the scientists themselves, but it has also revealed some of the secrets to attracting \\\"likes\\\" - at least if you're an animal.\\\"It just does not look like any other bird, with its almost anthropomorphic facial features,\\\" said lead researcher Katja Thommes, a psychologist from the University of Konstanz in Germany.\\\"And frogmouths are quite rare.

Think of all those pictures of pristine beaches, blue skies and sparkling seas.Seabirds though, at least in this study, appear to be far less appealing. The sandpiper and the oystercatcher joined storks and vultures on what the researchers called the \\\"not-so-pretty birds\\\" end of the list.But shareable and likeable does not necessarily mean the most beautiful, says wildlife photographer Graeme Purdy, who shares his images on his Instagram account.\\\"Anything cute and cuddly evokes something in human nature - and particularly anything with big eyes,\\\" he told me.Graeme, who recently took second place in the prestigious Sony World Photography Awards, says he tries to use the platform to engage people with images that he values.\\\"On Instagram, people generally love big cats and elephants, but if I post what I think is an amazing photo of a mongoose, it'll get no likes.

It's a fundamental underpinning,\\\" he told BBC News.Newlyn's efforts to begin measuring mean sea level during WWI were by no means the first attempt to track the highs and lows of tidal movements around the UK. But as scientists came to understand better the complexities of capturing and fixing a robust reference, the Cornish station took on primary importance.It was in an excellent position to do so. The pier stood on stable granite and the harbour, being close to the open ocean, was less affected by the confounding behaviour of waters that swirled around other stations sited near rivers and estuaries.OS ran a six-year study from the now-Grade-II-listed hut, starting on 1 May 1915.Sea level was measured through a hole in the floor that led down into a chamber which was open to the harbour. A float connected to a chart-recording gauge monitored the ups and downs of Newlyn's tides.The gauge was inspected twice daily to see that it was still working properly, and temperature, barometric pressure, and salinity measurements were also taken.There's a brass bolt in the floor of the hut. ODN, at the end of the six-year investigation, was determined to be 15.588ft (4.751m) below this mark.It was then possible, using the standard levelling techniques at the time, to go out and describe elevations anywhere in the country, using Newlyn as the common comparator.Measuring heights today has been transformed by satellites.GPS receivers measure height above a mathematical surface known as the ellipsoid but the data from gravity sensors in orbit has been used to construct surface models (a geoid) against which GPS heights can be converted to give you an elevation above mean sea-level to a few millimetres.\\\"We now use satellites to measure height relative to the ellipsoid, but ellipsoidal heights are not what you might call 'natural',\\\" said Mark Greaves.\\\"It still seems natural to have a height that's somehow relative to the sea. We're land-based creatures after all And if you're stood on a beach, it just feels right that height-zero should be somewhere around where you get your feet wet.\\\"However heights are measured, it's a critical endeavour. So many fields are utterly dependent on accurate mapping with precise elevation data.Modelling areas most likely to flood; understanding how air pollution will move around tall structures in a city; knowing where to site solar panels or cell towers so they're not shadowed; planning the routes of new rail and road infrastructure; even plotting the flight paths of the drones that will one day deliver our online purchases.All of these applications have a link to the legacy founded in that hut on Newlyn's South Pier on 30 April 1921.","postDate":"2021-04-30T02:11:12.000Z","title":"The Cornish hut that gave rise to sea level benchmark - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-56935097"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/12D62\/production\/_118145177_fish2.jpg","author":"By Dan Gibson","description":"In a series of indoor tanks 40 miles south west of Miami, Florida, five million fish are swimming in circles a very long way from home.The fish in question are Atlantic salmon, which are far more typically found in the cold waters of Norway's fjords or Scotland's lochs.As the species is not native to Florida, and would be unable to cope with the state's tropical heat, the water tanks are kept well chilled, and housed in a vast, air-conditioned and heavily insulated warehouse-like building.The facility, called the Bluehouse, opened its first phase last year, and intends to be the world's largest land-based fish farm.Targeting an initial production of 9,500 metric tonnes of fish per year, its owner - Atlantic Sapphire - plans to increase that to 222,000 tonnes by 2031, enough to provide 41% of current US annual salmon consumption, or a billion meals.The company is at the forefront of a growing movement in Europe, Asia and the US towards land-based, indoor aquaculture. But what could it mean for traditional sea-based salmon farms, and most importantly - what about the welfare of the fish?\\\"When we started [exploring the concept] 10 years ago, people thought we were completely crazy,\\\" says Johan Andreassen, chief executive of Atlantic Sapphire, which is a Norwegian-owned business.\\\"No-one was recognising that raising salmon on land would ever become financially viable, or even doable. Then the incumbent industry started to become more questioning. But they were waiting to see how the technology evolves.\\\"And now with Atlantic Sapphire, we have proven that it's possible. So now it's a question of how competitive can this be, and how large can it become.\\\"The technology that enables Bluehouse to operate is not new, but using it on a commercial scale only became viable in the last few years.Called \\\"recirculating aquaculture systems\\\", or RAS for short, they control everything from the temperature, salinity and pH of the water, to its oxygen levels, artificial currents, lighting cycles, and removal of carbon dioxide and waste. The latter are filtered out, and treated water is reused.As it is a closed-loop system, the salmon are not exposed to seaborne diseases and parasites, so unlike sea-based farms, Atlantic Sapphire says its fish do not need to be treated with antibiotics or pesticides.\\\"In general, compared to the [sea-based] industry, we have the lowest disease incidents and the lowest mortality rates,\\\" says Neder Snir, chief technology officer of Israeli firm AquaMaof. His company has now designed technology for 10 such RAS fish farms around the world.\\\"And it is important to note that this occurs without the use of any antibodies or vaccinations,\\\" adds Mr Snir. \\\"Because of the fact we're isolated and controlled.\\\"Atlantic Sapphire has already invested $400m (£287m) in its US facility, and plans to spend $2bn in total. By 2031 it intends to have four million sq ft (372,000 sq m) of tanks across the 160-acre (65-hectare) site.But why did a Norwegian firm choose to build a vast salmon farm in Florida? Firstly so that it can supply the US market without having to fly in the harvested fish from Europe. And secondly because of the unique nature of the southern state's geology.In very simple terms, Florida sits on top of two separate aquifers - a fresh water one nearest the surface, and then a salt water one lower down.As salmon needs fresh water when it is young, and then salt water when it is older, Bluehouse has a ready supply of both. And somewhat controversially, it can then inject what waste water it does produce down to an empty layer in the rock even further below.The company says this layer is entirely isolated and therefore cannot contaminate the wider water supply. It adds that only \\\"minimal quantities of treated waste water [are released] per strict local regulations\\\".New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.When it comes to wishing to shorten supply chains, Mr Andreassen says that the coronavirus pandemic has focused people's minds about the issue.\\\"The value proposition has become much better since Covid,\\\" he says. \\\"People want short, lean value chains with increased traceability, where fewer people are touching your food before you eat it.\\\"And the cost of air freight, with the passenger air travel industry on its knees, has been pressurised through the roof.\\\"However, the Bluehouse project has not been all plain sailing. In July last year an issue with its water quality meant that, in the words of Mr Andreassen, \\\"we faced a situation where we risked large [salmon] mortalities\\\". To avoid this outcome, the company decided to \\\"emergency harvest\\\" 200,000 fish before they had reached their full 20-month-old maturity.Another design problem in March this year caused further fish deaths, the firm had to report. And earlier this month it was reported that three workers at the facility had to go to hospital for treatment following the release of an unknown gas.Unsurprisingly, animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) is damning of Bluehouse and the 40 or so other firms developing such land-based fish farms around the world. These include a planned barramundi farm in Arizona.\\\"Fish farms [whether at sea, or on land] are pits of filth,\\\" says Dawn Carr, Peta's director of vegan corporate projects. \\\"Fish are not fish fingers with fins, waiting to be cut apart, but feeling, thinking individuals capable of joy and pain, and they belong to themselves, not to humans.\\\"Raising fish this way is wretchedly cruel and certainly unnecessary.\\\"Mr Andreassen says that the welfare indicators of the salmon, such as fin shape and swim speed, are constantly monitored at Bluehouse.And despite such concerns, Atlantic Sapphire's Floridian salmon has already proven very popular with US consumers. Last year its Bluehouse-branded salmon fillets sold for $12 per kg, more than double the price of Norwegian imports.So should Scotland and Norway's traditional sea-based salmon farmers be worried?Ragnar Tveteras, a business professor at Norway's University of Stavanger, and an expert on the industry, says questions remain about the viability of the land farms.\\\"I think there is a structural challenge there with respect to energy use, and then implicitly contribution to CO2 emissions,\\\" he says. \\\"And I'm still waiting for some better clues of what the cost performance will be.\\\"I'm not worried about the demand [for their salmon], but I worry what prices will emerge, and what that will mean for the [financial] returns of these land-based farms. I'm afraid for some it won't be profitable.\\\"Alan Tinch, Scotland-based technical director at aquaculture services firm Benchmark Genetics, works closely with Scottish fish farmers.

However, such projections are always highly uncertain.Originally injected into an elliptical orbit approximately 160km by 375km above Earth's surface on 29 April, the Long March-5b core stage has been losing height ever since.Just how quickly the core's orbit will continue to decay will depend on the density of air it encounters at altitude and the amount of drag this produces. These details are poorly known.Most of the vehicle should burn up when it makes its final plunge through the atmosphere, although there is always the possibility that metals with high melting points, and other resistant materials, could survive to the surface.When a similar core stage returned to Earth a year ago, piping assumed to be from the rocket was identified on the ground in Ivory Coast, Africa.The chances of anyone actually being hit by a piece of space junk are very small, not least because so much of the Earth's surface is covered by ocean, and because that part which is land includes huge areas that are uninhabited.The zone of potential fall in this case is restricted still further by the trajectory of the rocket stage. It's moving on an inclination to the equator of about 41.5 degrees. This means it's possible already to exclude that any debris could fall further north than approximately 41.5 degrees North latitude and further south than 41.5 degrees South latitude.China has bridled at the suggestion that it has been negligent in allowing the uncontrolled return of so large an object. Commentary in the country's media has described Western reports about the potential hazards involved as \\\"hype\\\" and predicted the debris will likely fall somewhere in international waters.The Global Times quoted aerospace expert Song Zhongping who added that China's space monitoring network would keep a close watch and take necessary measures should damage occur.But the respected cataloguer of space activity, Jonathan McDowell from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, US, said the situation did reflect poorly on China.\\\"It is indeed seen as negligence,\\\" he told BBC News.\\\"This is the second launch of this rocket; the debris in Ivory Coast last year was from the previous launch, i.e. a basically identical rocket.\\\"These two incidents [the one now and the Ivory Coast one] are the two largest objects deliberately left to re-enter uncontrolled since Skylab in 1979.\\\"Fragments of the US space station Skylab scattered across Western Australia in 1979, attracting worldwide attention.Hugh Lewis, who models space debris at Southampton University, UK, noted that more than 60 years of spaceflight had left a large legacy of junk in orbit. The responsibility for this litter rests on several countries, but principally Russia and the US.\\\"It's worth remembering that there are approximately 900 orbital rocket stages in low-Earth orbit, left behind by nearly every launch-capable nation and with a combined mass orders or magnitude greater than the one expected to re-enter the atmosphere this [weekend],\\\" Dr Lewis posted on Twitter.Modern practice now calls for rocket stages to be de-orbited as soon as possible after their mission. In the case of large core segments, these would normally come straight back, within one orbit, falling into the ocean or on land (the US company SpaceX now propulsively lands its core stages so they can be used again).For upper-stages that go into an orbit and may travel around the globe several times as they precisely position a payload, the preference is to include a re-ignitable engine that can steer the stage into a return at the earliest opportunity.Usually, this would be over an ocean - potentially in the furthest place from land in the South Pacific, between Australia, New Zealand and South America.Over an area of approximately 1,500 sq km (580 sq miles) this region is a popular graveyard of rocket elements and defunct satellites, where the remains of around 260 missions are thought to be scattered on the ocean floor.Additional reporting by Andreas Illmer","postDate":"2021-05-08T09:59:09.000Z","title":"Big Chinese rocket segment set to fall to Earth - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-57013540"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/FF4C\/production\/_117665356_gettyimages-1208925407.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"Killing Eve actress Sandra Oh has given a passionate speech at a Stop Asian Hate rally following last week's Atlanta spa shootings in the US.Oh said she was \\\"proud to be Asian\\\" and also discussed the \\\"fear... and anger\\\" within the community at the event near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Saturday.Asian women were among eight killed at three spas in Georgia on Tuesday.\\\"One thing that I know is that many in our community are very scared, and I understand that,\\\" she said.She continued: \\\"One way to go through our fear is to reach out to our community.\\\"In a video shared on CBSN Pittsburgh, the actress, who was born in Canada to parents who emigrated from South Korea, expressed her gratitude to organisers and those in attendance for the \\\"opportunity to stand together and feel each other\\\".\\\"For many of us in our community, this is the first time we are even able to voice our fear and our anger, and I really am so grateful for everyone willing to listen,\\\" Oh told the crowd.The actress and producer, who plays Eve Polastri in the BBC drama series Killing Eve, also urged people to help protect against violence and support \\\"sisters and brothers\\\" in need.\\\"We must understand, as Asian Americans, we just need to reach out our hand to our sisters and brothers and say, 'Help me and I'm here,'\\\" she said.Oh then led the crowd in a chant saying: \\\"I am proud to be Asian.

It causes a range of different psychological symptoms.Doctors often describe schizophrenia as a type of psychosis. This means the person may not always be able to distinguish their own thoughts and ideas from reality.Symptoms can include hallucinations, delusions, muddled thoughts and a loss of interest in everyday activities.Schizophrenia does not cause someone to be violent and people with schizophrenia do not have a split personality.Source: NHSFor the role, Basaula drew on the real life experiences of a Mind volunteer named Antonio, as well as lessons from Mind's Young Black Men programme.He described the storyline as being one that is \\\"very close to my heart\\\".\\\"I hope it will start a dialogue for people to have conversations about mental health and that anyone living with the condition will feel seen,\\\" said the actor.\\\"Working with Mind has been so useful, I spoke to a young man who bravely shared his story and it was inspiring to learn how he's managing his condition.\\\"He added: \\\"There's so much we think we know about schizophrenia, but it's often not the reality for people living with the condition.\\\"I hope that anyone engaging with Isaac's story will gain a better understanding and can approach someone they know that may be struggling from a more positive place.\\\"Viewers have already seen Isaac share his diagnosis with his dad Patrick, and his mum Sheree's resistance to him making it public knowledge - due to fears around stigmatising views from friends and family.Isaac's own fears around the circumstances of his brother's death and his dad taking part in a medical trial will lead to him to question his own diagnosis and abruptly stop taking his medication.EastEnders executive producer Jon Sen said that working with the charity was \\\"imperative in ensuring we tell Isaac's story truthfully\\\".\\\"There's a multitude of layers to this storyline and Mind's expertise has been crucial as we explore Isaac's experience,\\\" said Sen.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

It also said it would loosen its cloak of secrecy and strict admission rules.\\\"Today's overwhelming vote to reform the Association reaffirms our commitment to change,\\\" said HFPA president Ali Sar in a statement on Thursday.How have people responded to the reforms?Many high-profile Hollywood figures have said the initiatives are not good enough.Ms Johansson, who has been nominated for five Golden Globes, urged others in the film industry to boycott the organisation unless it makes significant internal changes.The 36-year-old recalled facing \\\"sexist questions and remarks by certain HFPA members that bordered on sexual harassment\\\".\\\"Unless there is necessary fundamental reform within the organization, I believe it is time that we take a step back from the HFPA and focus on the importance and strength of unity within our unions and the industry as a whole,\\\" she said.Ms Johansson's Avengers co-star Mark Ruffalo joined her, writing that the HFPA's reforms were \\\"discouraging\\\" in a social media post on Friday.\\\"Now is the time to step up and right the wrongs of the past,\\\" he said. \\\"Honestly, as a recent winner of a Golden Globe, I cannot feel proud or happy about being a recipient of this award.\\\"Meanwhile, Netflix and Amazon studios said they would stop doing business with the HFPA until it goes further with its reform plans.Netflix chief executive Ted Sarandos said he was putting their relationship on hold \\\"until more meaningful changes are made\\\".Criticism of the HFPA burst into the open in February when the LA Times wrote its exposé detailing alleged ethical conflicts and other misconduct.Following the story, more than 100 Hollywood PR firms threatened to advise the stars they represent not to work with the HFPA if changes were not made.They accused the organisation of \\\"discriminatory behaviour, unprofessionalism, ethical impropriety and alleged financial corruption\\\".The same group have said that despite this week's changes it will continue boycotting the HFPA.The HFPA did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.","postDate":"2021-05-09T20:38:06.000Z","title":"Golden Globes controversy: Scarlett Johansson joins criticism - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-57049645"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/10EF7\/production\/_118376396_gettyimages-1187682403.jpg","author":"By Kirsty Grant","description":"The UK loves its costume dramas.Bridgerton was Netflix's \\\"biggest series ever\\\", 73 million households have watched The Crown since it began and Downton Abbey's getting its second film spin-off this Christmas.But according to artist, writer and social commentator Akala, they're all missing something.\\\"Most of the period drama we get is usually focused on elites. Kings and queens and 'great men' - so to speak,\\\" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\\\"I want people to be able to imagine and historicise a black experience, specifically a black working class experience, and hopefully relate to that.\\\"Although Bridgerton was mostly praised for its racially diverse cast, it was still focused on elites.Akala's first novel, The Dark Lady, aimed at teens and young adults, follows the story of Henry - a 15-year-old pickpocket, living in a notorious slum in Elizabethan England, around the time of Shakespeare.He's black, and working class, and he finds he has secret powers.'Were there black people back then?'Akala isn't new to tackling this sort of thing for younger audiences.In 2009, he co-founded The Hip-Hop Shakespeare Company, which translates the writer's famous plays into modern rap.More recently, he was doing work on Shakespeare in schools, when a student asked him: \\\"Were there black people back then?\\\"\\\"That, in my view, is because there's been so little period drama about the subject,\\\" he says.\\\"Whether that's TV or writing. It's a deliberately cultivated ignorance, globally.\\\"Akala feels that most people get their \\\"sense of the past\\\" from entertainment, and that the \\\"black presence\\\" in Elizabethan England is not well known. He hopes his novel will \\\"surprise people\\\".Although it's commonly thought that black immigrants mostly arrived in Britain after the war, you could have met people from Africa in London streets in Shakespeare's day.Employed often as servants, but also entertainers, there were hundreds of black residents.We know they lived, worked and married into British communities.'London similar to 500 years ago'Although it's not \\\"well known\\\", Akala says the world in the book might feel familiar to some because \\\"London hasn't changed that much\\\".\\\"In terms of Dickensian inequality, in terms of the haves and have-nots, living cheek by jowl, London is really quite similar to what it was 500 years ago.\\\"\\\"I think lots of people will be shocked how much a teenager living in a slum then would have faced some similar challenges to kids living on a council estate today.\\\"Filling this \\\"gap\\\" in black history will help people \\\"understand their place within the world\\\", he says.\\\"I want people to understand the way the world works, the way power works.\\\"He says he wasn't brought up to \\\"believe the police were just there to protect everyone.\\\"\\\"My parents gave me a certain level of understanding of the way the world worked, I wasn't surprised. I was able to mentally process some of those experiences.\\\"Race, class, and their impact on society is something Akala is often called to speak on. His previous book, Natives, was a non-fiction commentary on these topics.Although The Dark Lady is a fiction book, Akala didn't feel the need to separate his political views.\\\"The idea that there's this neutral way of presenting art that isn't from a particular class position or doesn't have a particular view of the world - I don't believe is true.\\\"People have tried to present one view and one section of society as the default in the past, and then say anything else is political correctness gone mad. It's nonsense.\\\"\\\"I've taken my own experiences growing up, my own view of the world and some of my own politics.

It's 10:30 in the morning, and Rag 'n' Bone Man is wearing shades indoors.Has he succumbed to delusions of grandeur? Has he, since the global success of Human and Giant, turned into a monstrous diva? Will he storm off in a huff if his coffee isn't perfectly brewed?No. Not at all. None of the above. He's just a little worse for wear.\\\"I'm hiding the hangover from last night,\\\" confesses the star, zooming the BBC from his home in Sussex where, just a few hours ago, he'd been sampling the delights of a local beer garden.\\\"It is nice to be back in a pub,\\\" he says wistfully, \\\"but at the same time it's bloody freezing. It's really too cold to be out in the evening.\\\"He might be nursing a headache, but the singer is in grand form, not least because he's finally got some live shows booked after a year indoors.Next week, he'll perform to an audience of 4,000 at the Brit Awards, which are part of the government's pilot scheme for the return of live events. And if those test shows go well, he'll host a three-night residency at London's Jazz Café in June.\\\"It sort of feels mad that we actually get to play live on stage - but it's really exciting,\\\" says the star, whose real name is Rory Graham.\\\"The Jazz Café's only for 100 people a night, so it's definitely not a money spinner or anything. It's just about having fun and giving everyone a unique experience.\\\"The gigs will showcase his spellbinding new album, Life By Misadventure, which is the first since his 2017 debut, Human, rocketed him to fame.The intervening years have been something of a rollercoaster. As he accumulated platinum discs and Brit Awards, the star had a son with his long-time girlfriend Beth Rouy. The couple got married in 2019, only to split up six months later, after 10 years together.Musically, he was struggling to follow up the success of Human. \\\"I came off tour [in 2018] and started trying to write but nothing was working,\\\" he says. \\\"Everything was a bit flat. It felt like a continuation of the last album.\\\"Frustrated, Graham scrapped those songs and decamped to Nashville in 2019 with his musical director Ben Jackson-Cook. There, they hooked up with songwriters like Allen Shamblin and Mike Reid, who composed the Bonnie Raitt classic I Can't Make You Love Me, and Natalie Hemby, who co-wrote Kacey Musgraves' Grammy award-winning Golden Hour.\\\"They have a really different way of working out there,\\\" says the star. \\\"It was just sitting around a table, talking about what the song is about. Nobody's trying to write a hit, they're just trying to write the best songs.\\\"The music they came up with was a big departure from the hip-hop-infused blues of Human, veering into the singer-songwriter territory occupied by Elton John, Paul Simon or Joni Mitchell in the 70s.The drum samples and bombastic orchestration have been traded for brushed guitars and muted pianos. And while Graham's gritty, soulful baritone takes centre stage, his performances are more understated and vulnerable than before.'No to perfection'\\\"There's not a lot of music at the moment, especially in the pop sense, with a sense of space,\\\" says the singer. \\\"You can't hear any room in the vocals. It's all processed to be as clean as it can possibly be.\\\"I really wanted the whole thing to feel organic, so all of the songs are one-take vocals. We'd do three versions of each track and then pick the right one.\\\"It was about the vibe rather than trying to make every little bit perfect.\\\"As fate would have it, perfection was off the table anyway. Graham had booked three weeks to cut the record in February last year, but as soon as he landed back in Nashville, lockdown was imposed.\\\"We had to quarantine for two weeks - and then only had six days to record the whole album. It was mad,\\\" he adds, but somehow it worked. \\\"I haven't really been as proud of anything I've done as I am of this record.\\\"Born in Uckfield, near Brighton, Graham started his musical career rapping over drum and bass beats, before his parents encouraged him to sing at an open-mic night.His first big break came in 2012, when his girlfriend sent promoters some of his early recordings - including videos of him singing on the toilet - earning him a support slot with Joan Armatrading.He released his debut EP independently that year, and quickly signed a publishing deal with Warner Chappell, leading him to give up his day job as a caregiver for people with Asperger's syndrome.As his reputation grew, he was snapped up by Columbia Records, and his gospel-inspired single Human became a huge hit in Europe, topping the German charts for 13 weeks.It only belatedly made the UK Top 40 after it was covered on the X Factor by Emily Middlemas (\\\"She kind of nailed it,\\\" Graham observed) but after that, his life became a whirlwind of TV shows, awards ceremonies, world tours and personal appearances.It was not a lifestyle he adapted to easily.\\\"I'm quite a private person,\\\" he recently told BBC 5 Live. \\\"I have a small group of friends and I don't like massive crowds.\\\"I couldn't describe something that I felt more uncomfortable with than being on a red carpet and having people shouting at you and taking pictures of you. And then having to go to an after-party where you're paraded around as the new thing.\\\"I remember closing my eyes at one point and wishing that one of my mates would come and rescue me. It just doesn't suit me.\\\"In many ways, lockdown was just what he needed. For the first time in six years, festival season was cancelled, and he got the chance to spend the summer with his son, Reuben.\\\"We live right out in the sticks, in the middle of nowhere, so we got to hunker down and spend some time together,\\\" he says.Reuben's first words even inspired his father's newest face tattoo: the phrase, \\\"Oh No!\\\"\\\"He used to just drop food on the floor and go, 'Oh no, daddy!'\\\" laughs the singer. \\\"So I got that tattoo because I thought that was fun.\\\"Reuben also inspired the opening track on Life By Misadventure, a beautiful ballad called Fireflies that's full of fatherly advice.Other songs look at Graham's troubled childhood. He was both \\\"a bit of a worrier\\\" and \\\"little terror\\\", who had the police called on him more than once, and he tries to \\\"teach my son that that's probably not the right thing to do\\\".\\\"I want him to have the freedom to love whoever he wants and to be himself without too much teenage angst,\\\" he smiles.'Spit and sawdust'Despite his split from Reuben's mother, the album only contains one break-up song, Talking To Myself.\\\"It's such an overdone subject,\\\" he says. Instead, he's written about the \\\"archaic\\\" pressure on women in their 30s to start a family (Alone) and the curse of \\\"stupid male pride\\\" (Crossfire).His comeback single, All You Ever Wanted, meanwhile, is a raucous, guitar-driven polemic about the decimation of the UK's live music industry.\\\"I'm kind of romanticising the crappy little spit and sawdust venues I went to when I grew up,\\\" he explains. \\\"A lot of them don't exist any more and that makes me frustrated and angry.\\\"Like, is all you ever wanted another block of flats or a coffee shop? If those venues don't exist then where do the bands cut their teeth?\\\"He's also worried about the effects of Brexit on young bands, saying that new visa requirements will make touring Europe prohibitively expensive.\\\"I don't think it's going to affect me because I already have a fan base in those places,\\\" he says, \\\"but it's a worry for bands coming through, where just to have a tour break even is a good result.\\\"I feel sorry for them, man, because that's such a great time, when you're just starting to play venues in European countries. And the fact that [the new visa rules] might stop them doing that is a real shame. I guess our government just aren't supportive of the arts.\\\"For his own part, he's itching to get back on the road, with a full tour tentatively pencilled in for October. In particular, he can't wait to see fans' reaction to All You've Ever Wanted.\\\"I think it'll be a really great song to play at a festival,\\\" he grins. \\\"Not being funny, but in the past I haven't really had many songs that people can jump around to, so I like the idea of that.\\\"I haven't really recorded anything that 'rocky' before, but it's moving towards the place that I want to go for the next record.\\\"I've always had it in me to want to be in a band. So it's one step towards that.\\\"Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

They say it would bring hope and signal the start of Europe's long anticipated revival of live events.In Liverpool, an experimental rave took place only last weekend. But the pandemic here is currently much more serious and young people represent the greatest hike in hospital admissions.Some epidemiologists have argued it is irresponsible to be welcoming people travelling from across Europe in the midst of a pandemic.Who can attend and how?Performers and their delegations will take part along with a maximum of 3,500 audience members for each performance:Currently, anyone coming from abroad is asked to go into quarantine for five days before heading to the Netherlands. They must also take a negative Covid test before they fly. As there is a Dutch travel ban on most non-EU countries, anyone affected will have to show a return ticket as well as a letter from the organisers.What if there's a Covid case?Everyone working at Eurovision, including crew, artists and journalists, will undergo regular tests and if anyone catches the virus an \\\"isolation protocol\\\" will kick in.If any of the acts test positive a back-up recording will be used. That is something that the 26-year-old Dutch entry is desperate to avoid.Jeangu Macrooy, who grew up in Suriname, has stopped hugging anyone outside his household. And while he's afraid of losing his chance to perform on stage, he has no fear of becoming infected by screaming fans because he's confident in the safety measures.\\\"I trust that it'll be safe for them to cheer. I hope that they'll get to cheer because, you know, it would be weirder if they sat down without making noise,\\\" he told the BBC.What about fans inside the arena?Rotterdam's Ahoy arena will be at about 20% capacity and spectators can watch six rehearsals and the three live shows: two semi-finals on 18 and 20 May and the Grand Final on the 22 May.Bubbles are expected to be in place but the exact details are still being discussed. Masks will be required when people are moving around, but not when they are in their seats and at that point no social distancing rules will apply.What's the research value?Eurovision is being allowed to go ahead as a \\\"Fieldlab\\\" experiment, not unlike last weekend's Liverpool rave that saw 5,000 fans flock to Sefton Park and a similar-sized trial in Spain. No signs of higher levels of infection were detected after the Barcelona gig, where revellers wore masks but did not socially distance.The Dutch have already held experimental festivals, concerts, football matchers and conferences but this is the biggest and most complex gathering conducted under the Fieldlab banner.Some bigger events with up to 10,000 people have had to be cancelled at the last minute amid fears it would be impossible to control the crowds.The organisers of the Eurovision shows are planning a wider range of control measures and believe the experiment will be very useful.As nine shows are taking place within the same space, involving different people, a wider range of control measures and variations can be tested.\\\"Eurovision with spectators is far more interesting for viewers around the world,\\\" says lead Fieldlab researcher Prof Andreas Voss, who sits on the Dutch government's Outbreak Management Team. \\\"The atmosphere is completely different and far more natural, and the better data will help us to better predict how to reopen society.\\\"But not everyone is convincedThe Fieldlab experiments have been criticised for focusing on crowd tests and behaviour, instead of the possible knock-on effect for the Netherlands' wider, mostly unvaccinated, society.The Dutch government has invested \\u20AC2.7m in the events, and those involved say the testing regime helps detect asymptomatic carriers. Prof Voss says the risk of attending is no greater than in day to day life.Critics also argue the funds would be better spent on boosting vaccine rollout: that would help events reopen faster without the need for such tests.But the slow pace of the Dutch vaccination programme isn't due to a lack of funding, but rather problems with logistics of supply and rollout.And Prof Voss believes the data from Eurovision could help provide a model for the entertainment industry in the event of a further Covid wave later this year.What's the current Covid situation?Although hospital admissions have fallen in the past week, Dutch health officials say there has been a sharp rise in younger people being treated in this third Covid wave. The biggest increase has come from the 0-39 and 40-59 age groups.Some hospitals have declared their intensive care units full, others have been forced to postpone routine operations to allow staff to care for Covid patients.\\\"We don't take lightly the responsibility of hosting the Eurovision Song Contest at this challenging time and safeguarding the health and safety of all those participating in, and attending the event remains our top priority,\\\" says Martin Osterdahl, the contest's executive supervisor.With an audience of 180 million viewers in at least 45 countries, this annual spectacle has always been about connecting a continent on one stage, not to mention Australia too.Jeangu Macrooy hopes it will also offer a little glimpse of positivity and hope. \\\"People are pretty lonely nowadays,\\\" he says.\\\"It's probably one of the first big events that actually happening. I hope that after that the situation will get better and better.\\\"More stories from the world's favourite song contest:","postDate":"2021-05-06T23:35:56.000Z","title":"Eurovision's noisy fans are back despite Dutch pandemic - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-57008359"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/C965\/production\/_118375515_snfshutterstock_editorial_5885338w.jpg","author":"By Vincent Dowd","description":"From the Swinging 60s to the age of digital technology, a new show at the V&A Dundee looks at how club design around the world has evolved to reflect the ever-changing music we've danced to over the decades.Playing on an endless loop in the middle of the V&A exhibition Night Fever is a 40-second clip of John Travolta's famous moves to the Bee Gees' disco classic You Should Be Dancing.The scene from the film Saturday Night Fever is now 44 years old, but it remains a crucial moment in the history of nightclubs and discotheques. Pre-social media, and before Strictly and the other TV dance contests, the film made disco music and disco dance part of mainstream culture.The V&A show borrows its title Night Fever from the film. It looks back at the origins of disco culture in the 1960s and how it's developed since. This is its first show since the Covid lockdown and there's an emphasis on design - but it also looks at the clubs' social context and at the music played.Curator Kirsty Hassard says in the 1960s Italy led the way in creating nightclubs where teenagers and 20-somethings could enjoy themselves away from the gaze of parents.\\\"You had clubs like the Piper Club in Rome and then more radical developments like Space Electronic in Florence which combined discotheque with theatre.\\\"It was the boom of youth culture. But designers were emerging into quite a limited economy so they created spaces on a small budget, which were never meant to be permanent.\\\"Technology was more basic than it is today but a place like Space Electronic was pushing the boundaries of what a club venue could be.\\\"Night Fever uses photos, artefacts (and of course music) to look at clubs such as the Palladium in New York. It was started in the mid-1980s by Ian Schrager and Steve Rubell, who had already had a huge success with their New York club Studio 54 in the late 1970s.Artists Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat each painted large murals which helped make the nightclub one of the most fashionable venues in Manhattan.Gay culture has also had an influence on club design, especially in the US. The new show looks at gay Manhattan dance-clubs such as The Saint (which took over the space once occupied by the rock venue the Fillmore East) and Paradise Garage in SoHo, where DJ Larry Levan made his name.Hassard says one change in the 1980s was the emergence of so-called superclubs and their function in celebrity culture.\\\"When big venues such as Studio 54 and the Palladium were at their peak there was a lot of focus on which VIPs went where each night. Club culture became commercialised in a way it really hadn't been before and the clubs were in the newspapers all the time.\\\"A different version of this show has been seen at the Vitra Design Museum on the Swiss-German border. Leonie Bell, director of V&A Dundee, says she's delighted to see it travel north in an expanded form.\\\"But we first saw it before the pandemic. I think with Covid we're really aware of the poignancy of critical cultural spaces now being closed.\\\"It's part of the museum's role to be the champion of those spaces. But aside from that it's just a wonderful trot through decades of clubbing.\\\"There are social histories and musical histories and design histories. If you look at something like Studio 54 in New York you'll see the role of clubs in fashion and in art. There hasn't really been another exhibition like it.\\\"Attending the show's opening was Mike Grieve, who has run Glasgow's Sub Club since 1993. The venue, opened in 1987, is one of the oldest subterranean music clubs anywhere. Its specialism is electronica and its capacity is just over 400.\\\"Back in the mid-80s we played a mixed diet of predominantly black American dance music ranging from funk and disco and jazz to Latin and house and hip-hop. I think the first house music record that really broke through on the dance floor with us was Farley \\\"Jackmaster\\\" Funk's Love Can't Turn Around and it's still popular today.\\\"Design matters as part of a club's vibe but that's always hard to capture. For me two of the most effective clubs which had that vibe were the Haçienda in Manchester, circa 1989\\\/1990, and more recently Trouw which was in an old print works in Amsterdam. Sadly both are now gone.\\\"Grieve also chairs the Night Time Industries Association in Scotland. \\\"It's great to see club design taken seriously in a show at the V&A,\\\" he says.\\\"But there's an irony that whereas world-class museums in Scotland are finally opening up, Scottish nightlife still doesn't have an idea of when hospitality will be allowed to surface again. It worries me that some of our members may face bankruptcy.\\\"Inevitably a lot of the appeal of the V&A's Night Fever is for now nostalgic. Leonie Bell says for her it evokes her own clubbing days.\\\"I was in clubs a lot in Glasgow in the 90s. The great thing was you could let go. And that means so much now with all that's been going on in the world.\\\"They were an opportunity to be young, to experiment, to work out who you were, to meet people who were like you or maybe completely different. But you could be free - and at the moment I think no one feels free.\\\"Night Fever continues at V&A Dundee until 9 January next year.","postDate":"2021-05-05T23:46:40.000Z","title":"Night Fever: How club culture has moved with the times - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/entertainment-arts-56916861"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/1E8C\/production\/_118202870_image1.jpg","author":"By Will Chalk","description":"It's called The Sleeps Society and, over the course of this year, Melody and Greig are planning to spend over £1,000 each to be part of it.They both admit it takes a huge chunk out of their budgets, but they're also both adamant it's totally worth it.They're two of over 2,000 members - fans who pay a monthly fee and, in return, get access to exclusive content from Sheffield metalcore band While She Sleeps.And the band are convinced they're onto something.In an age where making money directly from music is getting harder, they say they've created \\\"a sustainable model\\\" that the rest of the industry could follow.\\\"The subscription model is actually nothing new, but up until now it's mainly been used by YouTubers and podcasters,\\\" guitarist Mat Welsh tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\\\"Streaming is an amazing tool, you can get a million songs at your fingertips. But in that same breath, it's kind-of devalued music.\\\"So we thought we'd encourage people to stream, but also help fund and support the music that's being made.\\\"It's almost like getting all our fans to become shareholders of the band.\\\"The Sleeps Society has four tiers - the cheapest, at £4.99 a month, gets you exclusive video content, access to an online community and priority when buying tour tickets.The most expensive, at £59.99 per month, gets you all of the above, along with merchandise, a personalised video message from the band, free entry to a gig and the chance to watch them sound check beforehand.The top tier is a lot of money for anyone, especially a cash-strapped student like Greig, but even though he admits it's \\\"up there\\\" with his biggest expenses, he's got no plans to leave any time soon.\\\"When The Sleeps Society was announced, I didn't really need to think about it, I just went with it because I knew the money was going into something I'm passionate about,\\\" he says.He's from Alva in Clackmannanshire, and studying graphic design at university, but makes time at weekends to meet up with other society members.\\\"It's more than just going down, buying merch and seeing the band, it's about meeting people who've got the same investment and the same level of interests as you.\\\"There are genuine friendships that have been born from this.\\\"Melody, who's 25 and from Swansea, is a top tier member too.\\\"I'm a musician myself, and The Sleeps Society has given me access to tutorials and vocal sessions with the band,\\\" she says.\\\"You don't get that anywhere else - it's incredible.\\\"I love Spotify, it's great. But it's no good for bands. I would encourage as many people as I can, if there is that one band that means so much to you and they've got these sort of platforms, you need to go out and support them.\\\"Support from the likes of Greig and Melody has allowed While She Sleeps to record and release their new album, and to re-hire their touring crew who'd been out of work because of the pandemic.It also means they're completely independent of any record label - and Mat's convinced it's a model the rest of the industry could follow.\\\"We've got just over 2,000 members, which is about one per cent of our Instagram following, and that makes us sustainable.\\\"So it's not about asking every fan of our band, or people who just listen to us every now and again, to sign up.\\\"It's talking to the core audience who really, really depend on on a band and listen to them all the time.\\\"And it's almost like if everyone does that with their super-fans, then those super-fans make it possible for everyone else who wants to listen.\\\"It's just about the power of a small group.\\\"Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.","postDate":"2021-05-05T23:33:25.000Z","title":"While She Sleeps: Why I spend big subscribing to my favourite band - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/newsbeat-56887239"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/5045\/production\/_106494502_nuart20192.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"The popular annual Nuart street art festival is to resume in Aberdeen next month after being cancelled last year due to the coronavirus pandemic.The festival took place for the first time in 2017, involving artists from around the world creating eye-catching designs on walls and the sides of buildings.Nuart Aberdeen 2021 will run throughout June and July, it has been announced.However, elements such as guided group tours will not take place this year.Unlike previous years when all the street art is created within a week, the production period has been extended and the artists' time in the city will be staggered.Adrian Watson, chief executive of organisers Aberdeen Inspired, said \\\"Nuart Aberdeen has had a transformative impact on Aberdeen, firmly placing the city as a must-visit destination for street art lovers from across the globe.\\\"The festival holds a special place in the hearts and minds of locals and visitors alike and we are excited to see it return to our city now that it is safe to do so.\\\"The first artist to be announced as part of the line-up is Helen Bur, who will explore the festival's theme of \\\"Memory and the City\\\".","postDate":"2021-05-10T10:42:40.000Z","title":"Covid in Scotland: Aberdeen Nuart street festival returns - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-57055353"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/11F5B\/production\/_118436537_onsetatthebottleyardstudios-thepursuitoflove-courtesyopenbook-moonageproductions-bbc.jpg","author":"Unknown","description":"Strict Covid-19 protocols have made Bristol \\\"one of the strongest centres in the UK\\\" for television production, according to a senior film manager.Bristol facility the Bottle Yard Studios provided the location for many of the large period sets used in the new BBC drama The Pursuit of Love.Laura Aviles said the adaptability of crews enabled the West of England to be at the \\\"forefront of shoots resuming\\\".The drama was one of the first to start filming during the pandemic in June.The three-part romantic comedy, filmed in Bristol and Bath, will be broadcast on Sunday.Ms Aviles, senior Bristol film manager at Bristol City Council, which manages the studios, said their team quickly got to work building operating procedures, such as one way systems and on-site testing, that meant the studios could be declared \\\"Covid-secure\\\" and permission could be given by the government for filming to resume.Ms Aviles said that once the green light was given Open Book and Moonage Pictures \\\"did an excellent job\\\" getting the shoot up and running.\\\"It was the hard work and adaptability of crews and companies in Bristol and Bath that enabled the West of England to be at the forefront of shoots like this resuming in the UK,\\\" she said.She added that the pause in production caused by the pandemic had a massive impact on local companies and freelance crews, many of whom \\\"fell through the gaps of financial support\\\".The Pursuit of Love features stars Lily James, Dominic West, Emily Beecham and Andrew Scott, and is directed by award-winning actor Emily Mortimer.Actor Mr Scott said despite Covid, testing of everyone on set made him feel very safe.\\\"Everyone was so thrilled to be back working.

So why are you still struggling to sleep?The answer could lie in your anxiety about the Covid pandemic, psychologists say, and this could be stopping you from sleeping - or giving you crazy dreams.Why can't I sleep at the moment?The pandemic and lockdowns have made it harder to maintain routines and to fall asleep, with many people reporting feeling more anxious than usual, according to a survey by the Sleep Charity, last April.Vicki Dawson, the charity's chief executive, said working from home and socialising on screens has had a huge impact on sleep, as well as worries about health and finances.\\\"There is a link between screen activity and having difficulty nodding off at night,\\\" she said.\\\"Screens are really stimulating and also there is some thought that they may suppress melatonin, which is the sleep hormone that we produce when it's dark, because the screens are essentially a light source.\\\"Emeritus professor of clinical neuropsychology and trustee of The Brain Charity, Gus Baker, said the stress and anxiety associated with the pandemic has disrupted our \\\"sleep architecture\\\".\\\"When we're not in a pandemic, we would normally be going out to work, we'd be exercising, we'd be eating meals regularly, we'd be looking after ourselves and we'd be engaging in social activities,\\\" he said.\\\"What the pandemic has done is to interfere with that... that impacts upon our sleep.\\\"Why am I having such vivid dreams?Libby Nolan, 57, a nurse at a hospital in south Wales, contracted Covid at the start of the pandemic.Soon afterwards, she began experiencing vivid nightmares.\\\"I was off sick for 10 weeks and that's when I had the dreams. It's like a recurring dream,\\\" she said.\\\"[In my dream] I'm at a party or somewhere everyone's relaxed except me and I'm terrified, I'm absolutely terrified. And I'm running round trying to get people to recognise that there's danger and people are ignoring me.\\\"They know I'm there but they're just ignoring me and I can't get anybody to react.\\\"Later in what she described as a \\\"night terror\\\", Ms Nolan dreamt she ran into another room where there was an old-fashioned ventilator attached to a faceless, long thin body on a hospital bed.\\\"Breathless with terror,\\\" she ran into a room where a large cat covered her face, stopping her from breathing.Ms Nolan's nightmare is now the focus of Dreams ID, a joint project between Swansea University and University of Wales Trinity Saint David, on dreams during the pandemic, where nine participants told their vivid dreams to psychology professor Mark Blagrove and a global online audience.Artist and head of contextual practices at Swansea School of Art and University of Wales Trinity St David, Dr Julia Lockheart, painted each dream, which will be exhibited at the Freud Museum London from 19 May to 12 September and at Oriel Science in Swansea from 22 May.\\\"Mark [Blagrove] said to me, if I tell the dream it will go away - and it has,\\\" said Ms Nolan.She said they had discussed how much anxiety she had faced as a health worker, particularly in the early stages of the pandemic.\\\"I can't tell you the terror in the hospital - we all thought if we catch it we die... it was really terrifying,\\\" she said.\\\"Nobody was sleeping. Work was so scary and it was hard seeing some of the things, but your team are like your family and you don't want to let them down.\\\"I wasn't alone. Everyone I spoke to was having really horrible dreams about death.\\\"Prof Blagrove said: \\\"We had nine online discussions with health or key workers in which they would discuss at length a recent dream or nightmare.\\\"There was a real close connection between the dream and what had been happening to them in waking life.\\\"What happens when we don't get enough sleep?Experts agree that regular lack of sleep can have adverse effects on our physical and mental health, with research linking it to increased risks of strokes and heart disease.\\\"Sleep deprivation has a huge impact on every area of life. There's lots of research about how it impacts our mental health and we know from missing a few nights how quickly it takes to feel low in mood, depressed, even anxious, because of that,\\\" said Ms Dawson from the Sleep Charity.\\\"If you're sleep-deprived it's much harder to make decisions and you might be more irritable.\\\"There's lots of research too around the physical side of things, so our immune systems become compromised if we are sleep-deprived and overly tired, so we tend to pick up things that we perhaps wouldn't have done. There's research on links to heart disease, strokes, obesity, and it's a very depressing picture.\\\"But if we turn it around and we get healthy sleep, what can that do for us? The benefits are huge, we look better, we feel better, we perform better, it has all sorts of positive knock-on effects, yet we often don't give sleep the priority that it really deserves in our lives.\\\"Prof Blagrove said: \\\"Having at least seven hours is really quite important for people from the point of view of the sleep washing out toxins that are in the brain.\\\"Research shows there's a risk of dementia for those getting less than six hours of sleep on a persistent basis, over decades.\\\"How to get more sleepThere are a number of ways people can minimise the impact of the pandemic on their sleep patterns, from banning the TV from the bedroom to simply closing the curtains.\\\"Try to avoid working on the actual bed, because we want the bed to be associated with sleep and not with the workspace,\\\" said Ms Dawson.\\\"I would suggest making a clear distinction between using the bedroom for work and using it for sleep and relaxation, like wearing a pair of work shoes, so when you're wearing them you're in work mode and when you take them off you're in home mode.\\\"Prof Baker added that working from home has changed the bedroom from being \\\"a place for sleep and sexual relationships\\\".\\\"What you need to do is ensure that's what your bedroom is for, so you need to remove any electronic gadgets from your bedroom,\\\" he said.\\\"You've got to create a habit for good sleep... before you go to bed you make sure that you haven't consumed alcohol or coffee or tea or any stimulant for at least an hour or two before you go to sleep.\\\"Go to bed at the same time each night and try to stay in bed until the same time each morning. You've got to learn how to switch your mind and body off and almost prepare it for sleep.\\\"","postDate":"2021-05-08T06:13:01.000Z","title":"Covid and sleep: 'Why can't I sleep and why are my dreams so vivid?' -

we have been given nothing.\\\"I think the uncertainty demonstrates the lack of understanding and respect of the role the Northern Ireland music festival events industry plays in the economy.\\\"The mini-festival in Liverpool's Sefton Park was one of the government's official trial events to research how large gatherings can safely take place again.The events form part of the government's Events Research Programme (ERP), which will explore the risk of transmission and the effectiveness of measures such as ventilation and testing.All ticket holders had to take a supervised coronavirus lateral flow test at one of four testing centres in the city the day before, and were only allowed in if the test was negative.Mr Gilmore, like other festival organisers in Northern Ireland, is hoping the data from these trial events will mean live music gigs can take place soon.\\\"The mini-festival in Liverpool was a brilliant idea and bold, I am really glad it happened - I look forward to seeing the data,\\\" he added.\\\"How that will be interpreted is the next thing.\\\"In England, the government is being positive and proactive with the live music industry, but it is not happening in Northern Ireland.\\\"We need some dates for reopening and guidance on capacities -

a cameo appearance for himself in BBC soap EastEnders.Redknapp, 74, will pay Walford a visit this summer as the residents of Albert Square celebrate the delayed European Championships.He's far from the only surprise high-profile name to pop up in a TV series. From pop stars to royalty and politicians, here are five other notable appearances.1. Boris Johnson (EastEnders)Today, Boris Johnson lives and works in Downing Street as the UK prime minister.Back in 2009, while mayor of London, he paid a visit to Walford's Queen Vic pub as part of a storyline that saw the late Dame Barbara Windsor's much-loved character Peggy Mitchell decide to stand as a local election candidate.The scene began with Peggy - an often fearsome landlady - promising to give Mr Johnson a piece of her mind if she ever met him.Of course, who should walk through the door soon after but the man himself, conveniently stopping off for a pint when his journey was halted by a bike puncture.The unexpected arrival saw Peggy go against her promise and become enthralled. \\\"It's such an honour to have you here, Mr Mayor,\\\" she swooned. \\\"Oh please, call me Boris,\\\" replied Mr Johnson, his pint briefly in view.When Peggy later mentioned her political interest, Mr Johnson replied: \\\"If you have any ideas for how I could help Walford, here's my card.\\\"\\\"I wouldn't dream of telling the mayor of London what to do,\\\" laughed Peggy.Scripted chemistry aside, Dame Barbara clearly made a real-life impact on Mr Johnson, who paid tribute after the star died last year aged 83, following a battle with Alzheimer's disease.2. Ed Sheeran (Game of Thrones)After topping charts and selling out stadiums and festivals across the world, pop megastar Ed Sheeran spread his musical wings to the fictional world of Westeros in 2017, appearing as a singing soldier in the opening episode of series seven of Game of Thrones.The brief cameo saw him perform a previously unreleased song around the campfire with a group of Lannister soldiers, and catch the attention of the formidable Arya Stark (Maisie Williams).Sheeran's character was referenced again in 2019's final series after seemingly surviving a run-in with a dragon.The Shape of You singer is far from the only musician to have appeared on the show. Other cameos included members of Coldplay, Mastodon, Of Monsters and Men, Snow Patrol, Foals and Sigur Ros.But Sheeran's fleeting part proved divisive among viewers and cast members. Actor Kristian Nairn, who played Stark family servant Hodor in the show, questioned Sheeran's inclusion and described the celebrity guest spots in general as \\\"stupid\\\".\\\"I don't like them... I don't mind going on the record on that,\\\" he told Huffington Post. \\\"I just think it takes you right out of the world.\\\"\\\"I was like: 'Why is Ed Sheeran here?' I mean, Ed Sheeran's great. He's a great guy, great musician, but why is he in Game Of Thrones?'\\\"It's a fantasy show. We're all caught in this amazing world and spend so much time and money and talent to create, and all of a sudden there's a pop star? What?\\\"3. Prince Charles (Coronation Street)The Prince of Wales swapped the halls of Buckingham Palace for the cobbles of Coronation Street when he made a guest appearance for the show's 40th anniversary in 2000.The heir to the throne featured in a pre-recorded clip of a news bulletin for the special live episode, shown meeting fictional councillor Audrey Roberts.The prince also paid a visit to the set and didn't miss the chance to try pulling a pint at the Rovers Return.4. Donald Trump (Days of Our Lives)As much a television personality as a politician, Donald Trump had made a string of TV and film appearances - most notably as the host of The Apprentice in the US - before his successful White House bid in 2016.They included appearing as himself in an episode of long-running NBC daytime drama Days of Our Lives in 2005. The cameo saw Mr Trump share the screen with actress Arianne Zucker and reject the advances of her character Nicole Walker, who pleaded for work by saying: \\\"I think you'll find I'm a very willing employee, working under you.\\\"The scene would go on to gain particular notoriety. It was while visiting the set for the episode that he was unknowingly caught on tape making obscene comments about women, and Zucker in particular, to Access Hollywood's Billy Bush, mere seconds before meeting her.The unaired footage eventually leaked during his 2016 presidential run and threatened to derail his campaign, forcing a rare apology for what he described as his \\\"locker room talk\\\".Zucker later addressed the incident in a lengthy post on Twitter. \\\"How we treat one another, whether behind closed doors, locker rooms or face to face, should be done with kindness, dignity and respect,\\\" she wrote. \\\"Unfortunately, there are too many people in power who abuse their position and disregard these simple principles and are rewarded for it.\\\"5. Pet Shop Boys' Chris Lowe (Neighbours)The normally low-key half of the Pet Shop Boys, Chris Lowe played himself in a 1995 episode of the Australian soap. His cameo saw him drive a flash sports car and ask for directions to a recording studio.Kind-hearted characters Marlene Kratz (Moya O'Sullivan) and Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy) happily helped out but, as older women more interested in Elvis, they hadn't heard of the group he mentioned being part of.Mildly bemused as he drove off, the pair were soon joined by the show's then-heartthrob Annalise Hartman (Kimberley Davies), who, they were surprised to learn, was a huge fan. Distraught at having missed out on the chance to meet one of her idols (in Ramsay Street no less!), she stormed off, thinking about what could have been.6. Emma Bunton (Absolutely Fabulous)Baby Spice landed a cameo role in a 2003 episode of BBC comedy Absolutely Fabulous, poking fun at her efforts to make it as a solo star after the girl group's split.Bunton's new PR Edina (Jennifer Saunders) and Patsy (Joanna Lumley) were typically haphazard, useless and yet somehow insightful as they tried to remake her career in their own warped image.The trio had remained friends after working together on the Spice Girls' Comic Relief single in 1997 and reunited for the Absolutely Fabulous film in 2016.Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

He has previously \\\"vehemently\\\" denied sexual misconduct or criminal wrongdoing.The latest reports come a week after 20 women told The Guardian that Mr Clarke, 45, had harassed or bullied them during his career as a TV and film actor, writer, director and producer.Last week, he said he understood that \\\"some of my actions have affected people in ways I did not intend or realise\\\" and said he was \\\"deeply sorry\\\" to those people. But he denied that his actions constituted sexual misconduct or criminal wrongdoing.He told The Guardian that he strongly denied the latest allegations. His representatives have not responded to a BBC request for comment.A BBC spokesman said: \\\"The BBC is against all forms of inappropriate behaviour and we're shocked to hear of these allegations.\\\"To be absolutely clear, we will investigate any specific allegations made by individuals to the BBC - and if anyone has been subjected to or witnessed inappropriate behaviour of any kind we would encourage them to raise it with us directly.\\\"We have a zero tolerance approach and robust processes are in place - which are regularly reviewed and updated to reflect best practice - to ensure any complaints or concerns are handled with the utmost seriousness and care.\\\"Last week, Sky \\\"halted\\\" its work with Mr Clarke, including on the fourth series of crime drama Bulletproof, while ITV dropped the final episode of his drama Viewpoint from its broadcast schedules. The BBC said it would \\\"not be progressing any projects with Noel Clarke at this time\\\".Bafta has suspended his membership, weeks after giving him an outstanding contribution award, and the Metropolitan Police have said they have received allegations of sexual offences from a third party.Meanwhile on Friday, Doctor Who and Torchwood actor John Barrowman was said by The Guardian to have repeatedly exposed himself on set. It said that was regarded as \\\"larking about\\\" and \\\"joking\\\" rather than sexually predatory behaviour.A video of Mr Clarke joking about Mr Barrowman's behaviour at a 2015 sci-fi convention resurfaced and went viral last week.In 2008, Mr Barrowman apologised for exposing his genitals during a live BBC Radio 1 broadcast. At the time, he said he \\\"was joining in the light-hearted and fun banter of the show and went too far\\\".In a new statement to The Guardian, he said his \\\"high-spirited behaviour\\\" was \\\"only ever intended in good humour to entertain colleagues on set and backstage\\\".He added: \\\"With the benefit of hindsight, I understand that upset may have been caused by my exuberant behaviour and I have apologised for this previously. Since my apology in November 2008, my understanding and behaviour have also changed.\\\"Mr Barrowman added that he was never made aware of any allegations against Mr Clarke.Mr Barrowman has not responded to a BBC request for further comment.","postDate":"2021-05-07T11:59:33.000Z","title":"Noel Clarke: BBC shocked by allegations of harassment on Doctor Who set - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/entertainment-arts-57021060"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/976\/cpsprodpb\/13651\/production\/_118414497_chrismartinthomaspesquetreuters.jpg","author":"By Mark Savage","description":"Coldplay's Chris Martin says that the pandemic has forced him to reassess his relationship with fame.\\\"Last year was a quite an eye opener,\\\" he told BBC Radio 2. \\\"I was like, 'Who am I without Wembley Stadium saying, 'you're awesome'?\\\"\\\"I'm trying in my life right now to not attach too much to being a pop star. I'm trying not to get my self worth from external validation.\\\"He was speaking as Coldplay unveiled their new single, Higher Power.They premiered the 80s-inspired pop song on board the International Space Station overnight - teaming up with French astronaut Thomas Pesquet, who beamed the music back to Earth by satellite.In a video chat, Chris Martin told the 43-year-old aerospace engineer: \\\"Right now we aren't able to play for anybody on Earth, so we thought we'd just play for you. It's like our one-man concert.\\\"The singer later told Zoe Ball the song had similarly intergalactic origins: \\\"We've been trying to imagine what music might sound like on other planets, and try to imagine being those other acts, so we're not thinking of ourselves as being the band Coldplay from England,\\\" he explained.He came up with the title first, but struggled to find the melody and lyrics to go with it.\\\"Then one day I was staying in this place and the sink was very resonant,\\\" he said. \\\"And so I started hitting the sink [to make] this beat... and then I went to the piano keyboard, and the song just landed in one go.\\\"\\\"So thank you to that sink,\\\" the singer added. \\\"That's great plumbing.\\\"Higher Power is the band's first ever collaboration with Swedish hitmaking powerhouse Max Martin, who has previously topped the charts with artists like Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande and The Weeknd.\\\"We know that he's far more successful than we are, so it's quite humbling,\\\" Chris Martin told Zoe Ball.The producer forced the band to \\\"raise our game\\\" in the studio, he admitted.\\\"I had to audition songs for him. [We] got really back to basics.\\\"\\\"It's been interesting to let someone right into the fabric of the songs [and] to suggest things that no one else has ever been allowed to suggest.\\\"Recording bubblesHigher Power marks the first time the Swedish producer has teamed up with Coldplay, but the band hinted more music was on the way.\\\"We'd be a bunch of lazy so-and-sos if this was the only thing we'd done for the last 18 months,\\\" said Chris Martin.He said the band had had to jump through several hoops to record together during the pandemic.\\\"We had to find countries where we were able to get in with permission, and then be in a recording bubble - and we did that three or four times.\\\"We tried to stay within the rules and get together when possible - but only when we won't be thrown in prison.\\\"Glastonbury plansThe singer added that the pandemic and the lockdown had forced him to look at his relationship with fame.\\\"Last year was a quite an eye opener,\\\" he said. \\\"I was like, 'Who am I without Wembley Stadium, saying you're awesome?'\\\"I'm trying in my life right now to not attach too much to being a pop star.

They're due to open the Brit Awards next week, playing on a barge in the middle of the Thames. Then, on 22 May, they'll take to the stage at Glastonbury, as part of a livestream that's taking the place of this year's festival.The band have previously headlined the event three times - and Martin told Radio 2 he had a tradition of visiting the site, which is a working farm, before they played to envisage what their set will look like.\\\"I like to go down in the winter and climb up the Pyramid and sit there and think about what we're going to do,\\\" he said.\\\"I just look at the cows and the grass and think, 'Okay, I'll imagine you're people'.\\\"But this year we have to just treat them as cows and grass and play to them. And I'm into that.\\\"You know, every member of the audience is special, whether they're human or bovine. We're going to give a great show - and nobody's going to be there!\\\"","postDate":"2021-05-07T09:59:17.000Z","title":"Coldplay's Chris Martin says lockdown made him confront his ego - BBC News","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/entertainment-arts-57020862"}]

To be very clear, this case is called the State of Minnesota versus Derek Chauvin. It is not called the State of Minnesota versus the police.\\\" The closing arguments in Chauvin's murder trial come as Minneapolis \\u2014 and the nation \\u2014 grapples with the rage and exhaustion of witnessing more deadly acts of policing in recent weeks. A veteran Brooklyn Center police officer killed 20-year-old Daunte Wright about 10 miles from where Chauvin's trial is taking place. In Chicago, horrific body camera video showed a police officer fatally shooting 13-year-old Adam Toledo while the boy's hands were in the air. Wright's killing has sparked nights of demonstrations in Minneapolis where authorities have deployed tear gas and other projectiles to disperse protesters. Multiple media organizations have told state officials that law enforcement has targeted and assaulted journalists covering the protests.The state's emphasis on Monday that the Chauvin case was not an \\\"anti-police prosecution\\\" but a \\\"pro-police prosecution\\\" was directed to the jury \\u2014 comprised of eight white people and six people of color \\u2014 all of whom had expressed their respect and trust in law enforcement and disapproved of defunding the police during jury selection last month. It was also intended for the jury to believe the testimony of several veteran Minneapolis officers \\u2014 including the department chief \\u2014 who said Chauvin violated their policies, training protocols, and values. Throughout the state's closing arguments, Schleicher emphasized that Chauvin's actions were not \\\"policing\\\" but a betrayal of his badge and his duty. \\\"He's not on trial for who he was, but for what he did,\\\" Schleicher told the jury. \\\"What the defendant did was not policing, what the defendant did was straight-up felony assault,\\\" he said. \\\"This was not policing. It was unnecessary. It was gratuitous. It was disproportionate, and he did it on purpose. And it killed George Floyd.\\\" Schleicher reminded the jurors that even after two of the bystanders witnessed Floyd take his last breaths after a \\\"shocking display of abuse of police power\\\" they still called 911 to report the officers to the police. During closing arguments, prosecutors showed the jury clips from bystanders' videos showing Floyd crying out that he couldn't breathe to make their case that Chauvin\\u2019s actions of restraining him with his knee for 9 minutes and 29 seconds, coupled with his failure to provide medical aid, led to Floyd\\u2019s death. \\\"George Floyd's final words on May 25, 2020, were, 'Please, I can't breathe.' And he said those words to ... the defendant. He asked for help with his very last breath. But Mr. Officer did not help,\\\" Schleicher said, referring to how Floyd addressed Chauvin during the deadly encounter. \\\"The motto of the Minneapolis police department is to protect with courage and to serve with compassion,\\\" Schleicher continued. \\\"Facing George Floyd that day did not require one ounce of courage and none was shown on that day. All that was required was a little compassion. And none was shown on that day.\\\" In his closing arguments, Chauvin's attorney Eric Nelson urged the jury to put the 9 minutes and 29 seconds of the encounter \\\"into the context of the totality of the circumstances that a reasonable police officer would know.\\\" He argued that the time frame prosecutors focused on \\\"completely disregards\\\" what happened before Chauvin and two other officers pinned Floyd down. Like he has done throughout the trial, Nelson characterized the growing concern of the onlookers watching Floyd take his last breaths as \\\"signs of aggression\\\" and suggested that Chauvin felt threatened by the \\\"crowd\\\" watching him \\u2014 contrary to videos and testimony of the bystanders. \\u201CA reasonable police officer is recognizing that the crowd is in crisis,\\u201D Nelson said. He also suggested that officers who know they are being videotaped by multiple bystanders would not intentionally or purposefully apply unlawful force. Nelson told the jury that the conclusion of the prosecution's medical experts that Floyd died of asphyxia \\\"flies in the absolute face of reason and common sense\\\" arguing that it was \\\"preposterous\\\" to disregard Floyd's heart disease and his ingestion of drugs, as contributing factors to his death. He tried to paint Chauvin as a \\\"reasonable\\\" police officer who followed his training and experience. \\\"Officers are human beings capable of making mistakes in highly stressful situations,\\\" Nelson said.

His company, Renwei Electronics, helps authorities in China track prisoners and detainees \\u2014 alerting guards to their movements and even fitting them with heart rate monitors. Renwei deploys its \\u201Csmart prison\\u201D system in China\\u2019s Xinjiang region, where more than 1 million Muslim minorities have been locked up. Yet this did not interfere with the warm welcome for Renwei at an event cohosted by an Amazon-backed \\u201Cjoint innovation center\\u201D in November. Event organizers gave Renwei\\u2019s executive a platform to deliver an \\u201Cinvestor road show\\u201D\\u2013style speech to some of China\\u2019s most prestigious investors. And Renwei received a \\u201Cproduct innovation award\\u201D recognizing it as one of six \\u201Coutstanding entrepreneurial companies.\\u201D Sent a detailed list of questions, Amazon declined to comment on the record. Renwei did not respond to a request for comment. A growing list of multinational corporations are under pressure to move their supply chains away from Xinjiang, amid mounting evidence of mass detention and forced labor there, as part of what the US and other countries have recently called a genocide. Congress is considering a bill banning imports from Xinjiang tainted by forced labor, and US customs have already banned products made from tomatoes and cotton in the region, among other goods. Amazon shut down its e-commerce business in China in 2019, but other parts of its sprawling empire still work with Chinese customers, including its highly profitable cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services. AWS runs the joint innovation center with local Shanghai government and business organizations. The center boosts startups by providing them with AWS cloud resources and tech support, and by helping them acquire talent and comply with government regulations, according to an ad for the event. It\\u2019s unclear what benefits, if any, that Renwei and other companies that won awards received. The center\\u2019s website emphasizes that the companies it supports also benefit from Amazon\\u2019s resources and reputation. Horizon Advisory, a Washington, DC\\u2013based geopolitical advisory firm, first made note of Renwei\\u2019s award and the Amazon event in research it shared with BuzzFeed News. Renwei\\u2019s technology has been used in prisons across China, including at Zhongjiazhuang Prison, located near the city of Shihezi. The prison is administered by the powerful Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a paramilitary and governmental organization that the US placed sanctions on last year, citing its ties to human rights abuses in the region.BuzzFeed News located the prison in Xinjiang\\u2019s Shawan County using satellite imagery. An official photo of the prison posted in 2016 shows a rounded front gate in elaborate ironwork and a lion statue to the left of the entrance. Behind the gate, a road leads up to a two- to three-story building. A white wall and a row of trees run along the road. A Google Earth image shows the gate\\u2019s shadow cast on the ground, a light-colored object about 2.5 meters high that appears to match the lion statue, and the same east-west wall and line of trees. The roof of the building in the background also matches the photograph. The Chinese government has forced upwards of a million Muslim minorities, including Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Hui Muslims, and others into mass internment camps in the past four years. A BuzzFeed News investigation last year found the government had dramatically escalated its campaign since 2017, building hundreds of new compounds bearing the hallmarks of internment camps and prisons. Dozens of people formerly detained there described abuse, deprivation, and routine humiliation inside, ranging from overcrowding and food deprivation to beatings and even torture. The government says the internment camp system is for \\u201Ctransformation through education,\\u201D and deradicalizing extremists. Government data analyzed by the New York Times shows that Xinjiang\\u2019s prison population has also ballooned during this time \\u2014 the region accounted for 21% of the country\\u2019s total arrests for just 2% of the population in 2017. Muslim minorities make up about half of Xinjiang\\u2019s population. China\\u2019s Communist Party\\u2013controlled courts convict more than 99% of defendants, according to government data. Prisons in many parts of the world, including the United States, use data-driven systems to monitor and control prisoners. But in Xinjiang, the government\\u2019s campaign specifically targets ethnic minorities by detaining them over religious practices, connections to family abroad, or other behavior seen as suspect or threatening to the state. Renwei describes its system as \\u201Can important platform for digital prisons to improve their management capabilities through information technology.\\u201D It uses image processing, data encryption, cloud computing, and \\u201Cbig data\\u201D to set up a \\u201Cpersonnel positioning system\\u201D that can be monitored remotely, the company says. The data is funneled into a centralized platform that authorities can use for \\u201Cmanagement decision-making.\\u201D Renwei says that this improves efficiency, and helps prison staff \\u201Cachieve new ideas of preemptive prevention, mid-incident control and post-incident verification.\\u201D An early warning system signals when police are attacked, Renwei says, and when detainees enter areas forbidden to them. Prisoners can be fitted with electronic devices that monitor their heart rates and other vital signs to \\u201Creduce the risk to law enforcement.\\u201D The system helps prevent people from escaping or killing themselves, Renwei says. High-tech surveillance is a hallmark of life in Xinjiang\\u2019s camps and prisons. More than two dozen people formerly detained there have told BuzzFeed News that they were monitored in real time by cameras that were placed in the corners of their cells and even in the bathrooms. Guards could punish them for tiny infractions, like speaking their native language instead of Mandarin Chinese. Renwei has also received recognition from China\\u2019s domestic security service, the Ministry of Public Security. The company featured at a ministry promotional conference attended by the department\\u2019s vice minister and other government officials.Onstage at the Amazon event on Nov. 16, 2020, the Renwei executive thanked the Shanghai-Amazon Joint Innovation Center for its support. In addition to Shanghai venture capitalists, the audience included executives from multinational giants such as Siemens and Kone Elevators, according to a press release about the event. The executive spent about 11 minutes flipping through a PowerPoint presentation that walked through each aspect of the business, noting that the system could be used not only in prisons, but also in detention centers. At the end, he looked toward the investors and asked for their questions. ●"},{"author":"Zoe Tillman","title":"Proud Boy Leaders Jailed In Capitol Riot Conspiracy","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/zoetillman\/proud-boys-leaders-jailed-capitol-riot-conspiracy","content":"WASHINGTON \\u2014 Two Proud Boys leaders charged with conspiracy in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol are going to jail. Ethan Nordean and Joseph Biggs had been allowed to go home after they were first arrested in January and February, respectively, and charged with participating in the Capitol riots. But prosecutors went back to a judge to argue that they belonged in jail after a grand jury indicted them last month on a more serious set of felony charges, including conspiracy. Prosecutors have alleged that as part of the conspiracy, Nordean, Biggs, and two codefendants were involved in encouraging Proud Boys members to attend the \\u201CStop the Steal\\u201D rally with former president Donald Trump on Jan. 6; raising money online to finance equipment and travel to DC; bringing \\u201Cparamilitary gear and supplies\\u201D; \\u201Cscheming\\u201D to avoid detection by not wearing Proud Boys colors; using handheld radios and encrypted apps to \\u201Ccommunicate and coordinate\\u201D the assault on the Capitol; and, ultimately, pushing past law enforcement and entering the Capitol. US District Judge Timothy Kelly announced Monday that he would grant the government\\u2019s request to place Nordean and Biggs in custody as their cases go forward. Kelly said he didn\\u2019t believe there were any conditions of pretrial release that would give him full confidence that the two men wouldn\\u2019t try to communicate with their associates and pose a danger to the community going forward. \\u201CThese defendants are alleged by their leadership and their planning to have facilitated political violence on January 6, even if they themselves did not carry a weapon or strike a blow,\\u201D Kelly said. Kelly\\u2019s order marked a rare instance of alleged Capitol rioters being placed back into custody after they were allowed to go home; prosecutors in some cases have successfully challenged release orders before a defendant was actually set free. In one case, one of Kelly\\u2019s colleagues in the federal district court in Washington, DC, reversed a release order for Thomas Sibick \\u2014 charged with attacking a DC police officer \\u2014 after he\\u2019d been allowed to go home. Unlike Nordean and Biggs, however, the reversal in Sibick\\u2019s case came days, and not weeks or months, after his release. The detention order for Nordean and Biggs is a significant win for the US attorney\\u2019s office in Washington after prosecutors faced a setback in their efforts to convince judges to keep certain defendants charged in the insurrection behind bars. The US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit last month set the bar higher for pretrial detention in these cases, especially for defendants who weren\\u2019t charged with specific acts of violence at the Capitol or with taking a leadership role; in the weeks after that ruling, prosecutors have lost or conceded detention fights in several high-profile cases. But Kelly said Nordean and Biggs were charged with the type of advanced planning and leadership roles that fit the DC Circuit\\u2019s new criteria. He said the two men posed a threat in that they could draw on their networks to plan large events \\u2014 attracting not only other Proud Boys and their supporters, but also counterprotesters \\u2014 and facilitate violence against law enforcement and civilians. Noting that the indictment alleged that Nordean, Biggs, and their coconspirators relied on encrypted messaging platforms, Kelly said that even with severe restrictions on access to computers and phones, there was nothing he could do to stop an associate from visiting and lending them a smartphone. Kelly said it was true that there was no evidence that Nordean and Biggs had violated any of their pretrial release conditions to date. But as for whether they could find a way to be in touch with other Proud Boys, the judge said, \\u201CI simply don't know what I don\\u2019t know.\\u201D Nordean and Biggs\\u2019 lawyers indicated they would consider appealing their clients\\u2019 detention, but Kelly refused a request to delay his order in the meantime. Nordean and Biggs were indicted along with two other men identified as regional Proud Boys leaders, Charles Donohoe and Zachary Rehl. The government has described Nordean as a Proud Boys \\u201Celder\\u201D and the president of his local chapter in Washington state; Biggs is a Proud Boys organizer who lives in Florida. All four men are facing six counts in the indictment, including four felony charges for conspiracy; obstruction of an official proceeding and aiding and abetting others in the obstruction; obstructing law enforcement during civil disorder and aiding and abetting; and destruction of government property valued at more than $1,000. Prosecutors shared excerpts from messages sent via encrypted group chats that the Proud Boys allegedly used before Jan. 6 and on the day, as well as social media posts and messages from the defendants as evidence that they were planning for disruption and didn\\u2019t regret taking part in the riots afterward. Nordean, according to the government, posted on Parler two days later, \\u201Cif you feel bad for the police, you are part of the problem,\\u201D while Biggs posted, \\u201Cwhat a day.\\u201D The night before the insurrection, prosecutors said that an unnamed \\u201Cunindicted co-conspirator\\u201D sent a message to two channels the Proud Boys were using telling members that Nordean \\u2014 who goes by the nickname \\u201CRufio Panman\\u201D \\u2014 was \\u201Cin charge.\\u201D \\u201CRufio is in charge, cops are the primary threat, don\\u2019t get caught by them or BLM, don\\u2019t get drunk until off the street,\\u201D the person messaged. Biggs was originally arrested on Jan. 20, made his first appearance in federal court in Florida that same day, and was immediately granted release and allowed to go home. The government didn't argue to keep Biggs in jail at the time, explaining in a later court filing that the initial set of charges against him, which were \\\"based on information available to the United States less than two weeks after the attack on the Capitol, did not support such a motion at that time.\\\" Nordean was arrested on Feb. 3 in Washington state, and a federal magistrate judge there ordered him released on Feb. 8 over objection from prosecutors. They appealed to US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell in Washington, DC, and she then ordered him released after hearing a second round of arguments from the government on March 2."},{"author":"Alessa Dominguez","title":"The Best True Crime Documentaries You Haven\u2019t Binged Yet","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/alessadominguez\/best-true-crime-documentaries-netflix-hulu-showtime","content":"Few topics have the built-in narrative allure, or ready-made audience, of real-life crimes. That probably explains why there\\u2019s now a glut of true crime documentaries. From serial killer exploitation fare to bizarro stories about increasingly wild subcultures, streamers keep churning out new series hoping to break out of the pack. Still, not all documentaries get the attention lavished on Tiger King or Making a Murderer (or focus on tabloid-ready crimes like the one at the center of The Staircase). Series that zero in on less famous cases, or a less obvious angle, may not be as splashy, but are often better at capturing the cultural stakes of a crime. So here are five recent (ish) documentaries you might not have heard of yet but you won\\u2019t be able to stop watching when you start.Like many true crime followers, I first heard about the Witman murder case in the Serial podcast. Sue and Ron Witman were interviewed about being duped by Adnan Syed\\u2019s lawyer, Cristina Gutierrez, whom they\\u2019d hired to represent their son, who was accused of murdering his brother. At the time, there was already a documentary short circulating online about the grief-stricken parents, and it was hard not to be haunted by their story. In 1998, their 13-year-old son, Greg, was dropped off by the school bus at their suburban Philadelphia home, only to be violently stabbed to death in the laundry room. His 15-year-old brother, Zachary, was the only other person in the house at the time, and police quickly zeroed in on him as the lone suspect. They believed the evidence \\u2014 including a small knife buried in the backyard \\u2014 pointed to him. The Witmans refused to plea-bargain, and Zachary was ultimately convicted and sentenced to life in prison without parole. The Witmans chronicles the entire story, mostly from the parents\\u2019 perspective. They argue that their defense attorney (who replaced Gutierrez) didn\\u2019t present a strong case \\u2014 failing to specifically contest the prosecution\\u2019s forensic experts with their own, for instance. There are many unanswered questions about Zachary\\u2019s guilt, but the documentary is more of an intimate portrait of a couple facing a horrible tragedy. It also captures the way the crime impacted the family and neighborhood. Even 20 years after the murder, the parents never left the home where it took place, and Sue Witman kept her son\\u2019s room intact. In one scene, a neighbor waves at them and the couple bitterly notes how his testimony at the trial aided their son\\u2019s prosecution. (The neighbor claimed he hadn\\u2019t seen any strange cars around their street the day of the murder.) Zachary ultimately agreed to a deal in 2018, pleading guilty in exchange for a release for time served. While there are glimpses of an unjust juvenile system \\u2014 he was only able to get release thanks to a court ruling overturning life-without-parole sentences for juvenile offenders \\u2014 they ultimately feel tacked on. Still, in the final moments of the show we witness the now-adult son\\u2019s homecoming, and while some questions might linger for viewers, the family arc gets dramatically effective closure.Perhaps because this story ends with an exoneration and appears mostly settled, the case of Texas high school footballer Greg Kelley hasn\\u2019t quite made the rounds of true crime Reddit. Still, it\\u2019s surprising that Outcry, a five-part Showtime series by Emmy-winning director Pat Kondelis, never really got the attention it deserved. It methodically deconstructs the incompetence of a small-town police department and the failures of the criminal justice system as it unravels how Kelley came to be wrongly convicted of sexual molestation. From the start, Kelley insisted on his innocence and went to trial, but ultimately took a plea deal and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The series chronicles the story of how Kelley, his lawyer, his mom, and his girlfriend (who stayed by his side) all tried to get him cleared. Kondelis started filming before Kelley\\u2019s exoneration, and he had no idea where the case would go. But it\\u2019s a wild ride. At the time of the accusation, Kelley had been staying at the house of a friend (and teammate) whose mother ran an in-house daycare. We get a ringside seat as evidence mounts against that teammate, and we witness a dramatic betrayal by Kelley\\u2019s original defense attorney. We also catch glimpses of the online supporters drawn to his story, and in some ways the series is a commentary on the way attractive, middle-class defendants can garner sympathy and support that helps put pressure on authorities. One of the most resonant scenes shows Kelley\\u2019s mother (an immigrant from Guatemala) powerfully calling the cops to account in a town hall meeting after his exoneration. Though Kelley has gone on with his life, the documentary\\u2019s message about the failures of the criminal justice system and police arrogance and corruption will stay on your mind long after the end of this particular story.Before the explosion of discourse and documentaries about so-called family annihilators (like Colorado husband and father Chris Watts), there was Jeffrey MacDonald. The Princeton-educated doctor and former Green Beret was accused of murdering his pregnant wife and two daughters one night in 1970. He claimed intruders had come into their army base home chanting \\u201Ckill the pigs\\u201D and slaughtered his family in a Manson-like copycat killing spree; he was gravely injured. Initially supported by his in-laws, he was acquitted by a military court. It was his subsequent publicity tour to raise awareness of the unsolved murder (including an appearance on The Dick Cavett Show) that renewed prosecutors\\u2019 interest. Eventually he was tried and convicted, and the case has been endlessly relitigated ever since. It was already the subject of Joe McGinniss\\u2019s famous bestseller Fatal Vision, which argued for his guilt, then Janet Malcolm\\u2019s The Journalist and the Murderer, about the questionable ethics of McGinniss\\u2019s book, and, subsequently, entire books debunking MacDonald\\u2019s conviction. The most recent book, A Wilderness of Error, was written by director Errol Morris, famous for his exoneration-sparking documentary about another murder, The Thin Blue Line. Morris\\u2019s book inspired Marc Smerling (Oscar-nominated director of Capturing the Friedmans and coproducer of The Jinx) to take a look at the case. And this five-part series offers the most comprehensive look at the entire story so far, complicating even Morris\\u2019s conclusions pointing to MacDonald\\u2019s innocence. Did MacDonald get a fair trial or was there police and prosecutorial coercion? Was Helena Stoeckley, the \\u201Cwoman with a floppy hat\\u201D who admitted to being present at the murder scene, and whom MacDonald claimed he saw that night, a fabulist or a troubled woman trying to tell the truth about what she had witnessed? This documentary answers some questions, raises others, and is a reminder of the fragility of truth in the crime genre.When privilege, romance, and murder collide, the results can be gory, but impossible to look away from. Killing for Love chronicles the intertwined fates of Jens Söering and Elizabeth Haysom, two University of Virginia students and lovers convicted of orchestrating the murder of Haysom\\u2019s parents in 1985. Haysom\\u2019s claim that her mother sexually abused her was the impetus for the killing, but it was never clear who actually committed the murders. She pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact. Söering confessed to the murders, but later claimed he had no involvement in it and was covering up for Haysom because he believed, as a son of a German diplomat, he would be extradited and save her from the death penalty. Haysom maintains her ex-boyfriend is guilty, but DNA evidence and a witness who saw the driver of the getaway car points to someone other than Söering. Killing for Love features interviews with Söering and his advocates. (A previous New Yorker article on the story also included Haysom\\u2019s perspective.) They were both recently paroled and deported back to their home countries of Canada and Germany, but the story remains a fascinating whodunit, and this documentary is an absorbing chronicle of clashing motives. Someone is lying, and we might never know who and what about.While most true crime series tend to suffer from being overly bloated in the streaming era, this is a short but effective look at a case that never ultimately went to trial. Juan Catalan, a 24-year-old Latinx man who worked in his family\\u2019s Los Angeles machining business, was accused of murdering 16-year-old girl Martha Puebla. (She had been a witness in his brother\\u2019s trial for murder.) Cornered in the police headquarters, Catalan was told by detectives that the main witness to Puebla\\u2019s murder had positively identified him as the killer, and that a composite looked just like him. Shocked by the accusation, he didn\\u2019t initially remember his rock-solid alibi: that he had been at a Dodgers game. Prosecutor Beth Silverman, necropolitically nicknamed \\u201Cthe sniper\\u201D for her record on death penalty cases, didn\\u2019t believe the alibi and pursued the charges, despite Catalan producing ticket stubs and his daughter testifying about getting an ice cream at the game. It was only footage from a Curb Your Enthusiasm crew filming at the game that day that saved Catalan. (He eventually filed a lawsuit for police misconduct and was awarded $320,000.) Though a compelling drama, this documentary also raises serious questions about prosecutorial overzealousness and police corruption that powerfully speak to the cultural moment.●"},{"author":"Ellie Bate","title":"McDonald's BTS Meal Funniest Tweets And Memes","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/eleanorbate\/bts-bangtan-mcdonalds-meal-tweets-memes-reactions","content":"According to a press release, the meal will consist of 10 McNuggets, a regular fries, and a regular Coke, plus sweet chili and cajun sauces inspired by recipes from McDonald's in South Korea.

All were employees at the facility, with some just arriving for the 11 p.m. shift. Four of them were members of the Sikh community, which local leaders have said must be factored into the ongoing investigation of the shooter\\u2019s motive. The 19-year-old, who previously worked at the FedEx facility, killed himself after opening fire in the parking lot and inside. It was the latest in several mass shootings over the last month. So far in 2021, at least 5,530 people have died from gun violence, not including those who have died by suicide, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. A vigil is planned for Sunday night on the steps of City Hall for the victims. Here\\u2019s how friends and family are remembering them:Amarjit Sekhon, 48, leaves behind two sons and her husband. Her brother-in-law, Kuldip Sekhon, told the Associated Press that she started working at the FedEx facility in November and \\u201Cwas a dedicated worker whose husband was disabled.\\u201D \\u201CShe was a workaholic; she always was working, working,\\u201D he said. \\u201CShe would never sit still ... the other day she had the [COVID-19 vaccine] and she was really sick, but she still went to work.\\u201D Sekhon\\u2019s 22-year-old son, Diljot Sekhon, echoed this sentiment about his mother to the Indianapolis Star, saying, \\u201CShe worked countless hours a week just so that she could provide food for everyone in the house. She did everything she could for her two kids and her husband.\\u201D His mother had been helping to support her family since she came to the US, he added. \\\"She\\u2019s been trying her best,\\u201D he told the Star. \\u201CAnd that's exactly how she died; she was going to work.\\u201DFifty-year-old Jasvinder Kaur was a relative of Sekhon\\u2019s. According to the Washington Post, Kaur didn\\u2019t have her driver\\u2019s license, so Sekhon drove her to work every day. The two of them were shot and killed in the FedEx facility\\u2019s parking lot when they arrived to work their shift.

Interim Austin Police Chief Joseph Chacon identified the suspect as 41-year-old Stephen Broderick. Following an extensive manhunt, Broderick was spotted by two people who called police and said they'd seen walking down a street just before 7 a.m. Monday morning, according to Manor Police who detained him. Manor Police took him into custody without incident and said in a statement that Broderick had a loaded pistol in his waistband. Police first received a call about the shooting at 11:42 a.m on Sunday. When they arrived on the scene four minutes later, they found a man and two women dead. Chacon said he believed Broderick targeted the victims, and police earlier said the shooting appeared to be a \\\"domestic situation.\\\" The exact motive remains under investigation.In 2020, Broderick was arrested and charged in the sexual assault of a 16-year-old girl, the Austin American-Statesman reported. At the time, Broderick was a detective with the Travis County Sheriff's Office and worked in the property crimes division, a spokesperson for the sheriff's office told BuzzFeed News. He resigned from the agency following his arrest, the spokesperson said. Austin police released his booking photo from 2020 as they continued to search for Broderick on Sunday.

Philip, the Queen's husband of 73 years, died earlier this month at 99.Here are moments from the funeral procession and remembrance ceremonies you might have missed:Philip's love of carriage driving was widely known and even referenced by his grandson Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, in his statement about his grandfather's death. His hat, gloves, and whip were placed in the spot where the driver traditionally sits.The group appeared to include a variety of different men and women who worked in service to the duke.The future king was not the only member of the family who was visibly emotional during the procession and service. Charles' sister-in-law Sophie, Countess of Wessex, removed her mask at one point during the ceremony to blow her nose and wipe her eyes.He began working for Philip in 2010.In a statement April 9, the College of Arms said that all flags must be flown at \\\"half-mast\\\" until 8 a.m. the day after the funeral, with one exception: \\\"When the Queen is present within a building or its precincts ... the Royal Standard will be flown at full mast.\\\" You might remember this particular issue about the Queen being in residence and flags not being at half-staff after the death of Princess Diana in 1997.Representatives from the Royal Navy; the Royal Marines, of which Philip was the captain general for 64 years; the Highlanders, 4th Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland; and the Royal Air Force lined the road along the procession. The funeral service's opening hymn, \\\"Eternal Father, Strong to Save,\\\" is traditionally associated with the Royal Navy. At the service's conclusion, Royal Marines buglers played \\\"The Last Post,\\\" a song that signals \\\"that a soldier has gone to his final resting place,\\\" Buckingham Palace said in a statement. The buglers followed that with \\\"Action Stations,\\\" a traditional Royal Navy bugle call. \\\"This is traditionally an announcement that would be made on a naval warship to signify that all hands should go to battle stations, and was requested by His Royal Highness,\\\" the palace said.The first prelude, \\\"Schmücke dich, o liebe Seele\\\" (\\\"Deck thyself, my soul, with gladness\\\"), appeared to be a nod to his German heritage. Another song that was performed, \\\"Jubilate in C,\\\" by Benjamin Britten, was specially commissioned by Philip to be performed in St. George's Chapel. The version of Psalm 104 that was sung by the small choir was also written at Philip's request by composer William Lovelady.In a statement Friday, the palace confirmed that no congregational singing would happen at the funeral \\\"in line with government guidelines\\\" regarding COVID-19.First, the funeral itself was held in St. George's Chapel. But there was also a reference to England's patron saint during the service. Philip was a member of the United Kingdom's highest chivalric order, the Order of the Garter, which features St. George's Cross on its coat of arms. In the service, the dean of Windsor, the register of the order, asked for a blessing from God, \\\"who didst give to thy servant St. George grace to lay aside the fear of man, and to be faithful even unto death.\\\" The references to the saint are particularly appropriate, since legend says he was a Greek soldier in the Roman army, and Philip, a military man, was born a member of the Greek royal family.\\\"Eternal Father, Strong to Save,\\\" asks God to \\\"hear us when we cry to thee \\\/ For those in peril on the sea.\\\" The first reading, or lesson, from the book of Ecclesiasticus was about the belief in God's power in creating the world, particularly the seas: \\\"By the power of his thought [God] tamed the deep and planted it with islands. Those who sail the sea tell stories of its dangers, which astonish all who hear them; in it are strange and wonderful creatures, all kinds of living things and huge sea monsters.\\\" Psalm 104 praises God for giving riches \\\"to the sea so great and wide\\\" and describes the ocean as the Earth's \\\"robe.\\\" And one of the final prayers asked God to \\\"grant unto [Philip] the assurance of thine ancient promise that thou wilt ever be with those who go down to the sea in ships and occupy their business in great waters.\\\"Speculation was rampant that there would be a noticeable chill between Harry and the other members of his family, especially after the visible coolness at the Sussexes\\u2019 last official event. This is the first time Harry was seen with the royals since his and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex's blockbuster interview with Oprah Winfrey, in which they alleged that a member of the royal family \\u2014 who they later specified was not the Queen or Philip \\u2014 raised questions about what color their son Archie\\u2019s skin would be.

The Sikh community might be the largest workforce in this facility, but this attacker knew that going in, and I don't think you can separate that out from his targeting of this specific facility,\\u201D Amrith Kaur, legal director of the Sikh Coalition, told BuzzFeed News. About 90% of the workers at the warehouse were part of the local Sikh community, police have said. Police have not said what they believe is the motive for yet another mass shooting in America, though they did say the gunman, who was white, was a former employee at the facility and appeared to indiscriminately fire at people in the parking lot and indoors. The massacre came nearly a month after another shooting that targeted Asian Americans in Atlanta. The shared religious background of the victims in Indianapolis shouldn\\u2019t be overlooked or separated from the anti-Asian sentiment that has been seen across the US, Kaur said. \\u201CEven if they never classify this as a hate crime, under the totality of the circumstances, I do not think you can separate that from whatever other factors may be at play,\\u201D Kaur, a former prosecutor who now works as part of the largest Sikh civil rights and advocacy organization in the nation, told BuzzFeed News.

It\\u2019s why most of them left India. They wanted better lives for themselves. They come here and end up in similar situations. It\\u2019s just terrible,\\u201D Chohan told Rekhi. Chohan also paid tribute to her grandmother on Instagram: \\u201CAMARJEET KAUR JOHAL you deserved so much better than this. Never forget her name and we will not stop until we receive justice.\\u201DJaswinder Singh is reported to have only recently started working at the FedEx facility where he was tragically killed. The 68-year-old was about to receive his first paycheck. Jasvinder Kaur relocated to the United States from India three years ago. The 50-year-old would typically work late-night shifts with Amarjit Sekhon, a 48-year-old mother of two who was also killed Thursday, the New York Times reported. \\u201CShe was a workaholic; she always was working, working,\\u201D Kuldip Sekhon, Amarjit Sekhon's brother-in-law, told the Associated Press on Saturday. \\u201CShe would never sit still ... the other day she had the [COVID-19] shot and she was really sick, but she still went to work.\\u201D She had only begun working there in November and had previously worked at a bakery. Sekhon had relocated to Indianapolis from Ohio with her teenage sons, primarily to be closer to family. The community is currently experiencing shock and fear, Amrith Kaur of the Sikh Coalition said, which is unsurprising, since many have to return to work at the very facility where their colleagues were killed. \\u201CI think, for the Sikh community members in Indianapolis, like many others that experienced this type of terrible violence in their workplace, they really don't have a choice but to go back there,\\u201D Kaur said. \\u201CIn a couple of days, a couple of weeks, whenever the time may come, they will have to go back to the very place they narrowly escaped with their lives, and if they don't feel like anything is being done to protect them, then where does that leave them emotionally?

His claims contradicted Floyd\\u2019s official autopsy report and testimonies of several medical experts. David Fowler, the former chief medical examiner of Maryland, also testified that Floyd died of a sudden cardiac arrhythmia due to his heart disease while being restrained by Chauvin and two other police officers, adding that the ingestion of drugs and a tumor were contributing factors. His testimony contradicted the Hennepin County medical examiner, Andrew Baker, who conducted Floyd's autopsy and testified last week that the actions by the Minneapolis police officers \\u2014 including Chauvin pressing his knee into Floyd's neck for more than 9 minutes \\u2014 were the main cause of death. Drugs and heart disease also played a role, he added. There were no findings of carbon monoxide poisoning either in Baker's autopsy report or in his testimony as a witness for the state. On cross-examination, Fowler conceded that the air Floyd was breathing at the time was never tested and that he had not seen any data or test results that showed the 46-year-old had any carbon monoxide\\u2013related injuries. Fowler also said he was not provided evidence that the squad car was running, but he believed it was based on his observation of water dripping out of the tailpipe in the videos. Even though Fowler said that Floyd did not \\\"exclusively die\\\" from carbon monoxide poisoning, he spent a significant amount of time testifying about the potential effects of the gas on his ability to breathe, adding that people with heart disease, like Floyd, are \\\"adversely affected\\\" by carbon monoxide.The testimony about Floyd's cause of death contradicted those of several medical experts for the prosecution, who have said he died of low oxygen or positional asphyxia because of the officers pressing down on him while he was handcuffed facedown on the street. The experts, including a cardiologist, a pulmonologist, and a forensic pathologist, also ruled out Floyd's tumor or the presence of methamphetamine as significant factors in his death. Fowler's involvement in Chauvin's case was deemed troubling by some criminal justice advocates; he is one of several parties being sued by the family of Anton Black, a Black teenager whose 2018 death in police custody in Maryland was \\\"chillingly similar\\\" to Floyd's case, the Intercept reported. Black, a 19-year-old high school athlete with bipolar disorder, struggled to breathe while handcuffed under the weight of three white police officers and cried out for his mother in the last moments of his life. \\\"Anton Black died because police employed excessive force, laying him out prone on his stomach, lying on top of him for approximately six minutes and approximately five minutes after he was handcuffed, and folding his legs towards the sky in a manner that further compromised his ability to breathe,\\\" the lawsuit states. Floyd, who was handcuffed in a prone position on the street, repeatedly said he couldn't breathe and cried out \\\"mama\\\" several times while Chauvin's knee was on his neck and back for 9 minutes and 29 seconds. The autopsy report, signed by Fowler, concluded that Black's death was an accident and there was no evidence that the restraint by law enforcement \\\"directly caused or significantly contributed\\\" to Black's death. \\\"In particular no evidence was found that restraint led to the decedent being asphyxiated,\\\" Black's autopsy report said. In the federal lawsuit filed last year, Black's family alleged that Fowler, then the chief medical examiner, and the assistant medical examiner \\\"intentionally concealed police responsibility in causing Anton Black\\u2019s painful death.\\\" The lawsuit states that the medical examiner's autopsy report \\\"falsely\\\" attributed the cause of death \\\"to a heart condition, bipolar disorder and\\\/or other natural causes, thereby 'blaming the victim' for his own death.\\\" During his testimony on Wednesday, Fowler categorized Floyd's manner of death as \\\"undetermined\\\" despite Baker's conclusion in the official autopsy report that it was a homicide. Fowler said there were many \\\"conflicting mechanisms,\\\" including carbon monoxide, Floyd's ingestion of drugs, his heart disease, and the \\\"stressful situation\\\" he was in that would make it \\\"very difficult to say\\\" which manner of death was the most accurate. He said that while death from carbon monoxide is usually classified as an accident, in Floyd's case \\\"somebody was holding him there,\\\" which would \\\"elevate it to a homicide.\\\" \\\"I would fall back to 'undetermined,'\\\" Fowler told the jury."},{"author":"Tasneem Nashrulla","title":"Drugs Not The Main Cause Of George Floyd's Death, Medical Experts Testify","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/tasneemnashrulla\/george-floyd-medical-examiner-cause-of-death","content":"The county medical examiner who conducted George Floyd's autopsy testified Friday that the actions of police officers were the main cause of his death, although drugs and underlying heart conditions played a role. Hennepin County Medical Examiner Andrew Baker said his opinion on what killed Floyd remained unchanged from what he listed in the death certificate last June. \\\"That's cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression. That was my top line then. It would stay my top line now,\\\" Baker said. Floyd\\u2019s use of methamphetamine and fentanyl and his preexisting heart conditions were \\u201Cnot the direct causes of his death,\\\" he said. His testimony during Derek Chauvin's murder trial came after prosecutors called several medical experts to support their argument that the former Minneapolis police officer's actions, including pressing his knee on Floyd's neck, were fatal. The presence of methamphetamine and fentanyl in Floyd's system at the time of his death is central to the defense's argument that those drugs and underlying heart conditions caused his death. Floyd had 11 nanograms of fentanyl per milliliter and a low level of meth in his system. While the defense has yet to present its case, Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, has frequently mentioned fentanyl overdose deaths and the effects of methamphetamine on the heart during his cross-examination of the state's medical experts. Nelson is expected to call his own medical experts to testify. Baker said Floyd's enlarged heart already needed more oxygen than normally required due to his \\\"severe underlying heart disease\\\" and a history of hypertension. Floyd's interaction with the officers would have caused him to release stress hormones like adrenaline, Baker said, which would cause his heart to beat faster and require more oxygen. According to Baker, Floyd's encounter with Chauvin and three other officers \\\"tipped him over the edge\\\" given his heart's condition. The prosecution's medical experts suggested that Floyd's chronic drug use over the years could have built up his tolerance to higher levels of fentanyl. They also said that the level of meth in his system was too low to be a significant factor in his death. Bill Smock, a police surgeon who said he frequently deals with fentanyl overdose cases, told the jury Thursday that Floyd showed no signs of suffering from a fentanyl overdose. \\\"We watch those videos, he\\u2019s breathing, he's talking, he's not snoring, he's saying, 'Please get off me, I can't breathe.' That is not a fentanyl overdose, that is someone begging to breathe,\\\" Smock said. Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist who previously worked at the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office and was involved in training Baker, testified that the \\\"mechanism\\\" of Floyd's death was asphyxia or low oxygen to the brain. Martin Tobin, a pulmonary and critical medicine doctor with 45 years of experience, ruled out both drugs and Floyd's heart conditions as the cause of his death, echoing testimony that Floyd died of asphyxia or low oxygen to the brain. The medical experts also said asphyxia is not typically listed on autopsies because, as Tobin said, \\\"it doesn't leave a fingerprint.\\\""},{"author":"Tasneem Nashrulla","title":"George Floyd Died From Low Oxygen Level, Doctor Testifies","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/tasneemnashrulla\/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-breathing-doctor","content":"In the final moments of his life, George Floyd was so desperate for air that he resorted to trying to use his fingers, knuckles, and shoulder muscles to position himself to breathe while being pinned down by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, a medical expert testified Thursday. Dr. Martin Tobin, a pulmonary and critical medicine doctor with 45 years of experience, was called on by the prosecution as an outside expert witness to testify about Floyd's cause of death, which is at the center of Chauvin's murder trial in Minneapolis. Prosecutors say that Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck contributed to his death. The defense argues that Floyd's use of illicit drugs and underlying medical conditions were the key factors. Tobin testified that Floyd died due to a low level of oxygen caused by the combination of being handcuffed in the prone position on the ground and Chauvin's left knee on his neck and right knee on his back, compromising his ability to breathe. The jury was shown an image from an officer's body camera video in which Floyd's knuckles are seen pressed against the tire of the squad car while Chauvin's knees are on his neck and back. Tobin said that while this gesture would not seem important to most people, it was \\\"extraordinarily significant\\\" to a physiologist. \\\"This tells you that [Floyd] has used up his resources, and he's now literally trying to breathe with his fingers and knuckles,\\\" Tobin said.Tobin said that people first use their diaphragm and rib cage to breathe, but if these become unavailable then they will try to use the sternum muscle in their neck. \\\"When those are wasted up, then you're relying on these types of muscles like your fingers to try and stabilize your whole right side,\\\" Tobin said, \\\"because [Floyd's] totally dependent on getting air into the right side.\\\" Tobin said that Floyd's left side was squeezed in a \\\"vise\\\" between the officers on top of him pushing his handcuffs against his back and the \\\"hard asphalt\\\" of the street. \\\"He was being squashed between the two sides,\\\" Tobin said, adding that his ability to expand his left side to breathe was \\\"enormously impaired.\\\" He testified that Floyd was \\\"using his fingers and his knuckles against the street to try and crank up the right side of his chest\\\" as it was \\\"his only way to try and get air to get into the right lung.\\\" Floyd also tried to use his shoulder to breathe on his left side, which is \\\"one of the very last muscles\\\" people use to breathe, Tobin said. Tobin said that video showed Floyd contracting his shoulder to try to get oxygen but that it was \\\"ineffective.\\\" \\\"It's a very poor way of breathing,\\\" Tobin told the jury, \\\"but it's what you have to do when everything else is failing.\\\" The jury was also shown an image where Chauvin's toe was seen lifted off the ground while his knee was on Floyd's neck. This meant 91.5 pounds, half of Chauvin's weight, was directly compressing Floyd's neck at that point, Tobin said. Tobin testified that his review of the video footage in the case showed that Chauvin had his left knee on Floyd's neck more than 90% of the time; his right knee moved between Floyd's back and arm and was \\\"rammed\\\" into the left side of his chest. Even a healthy person who did not have Floyd's preexisting medical conditions would have died, Tobin said, had they been subjected to what he had experienced. During the incident, Tobin said, Floyd's airway passage narrowed so much that it was \\\"like breathing through a drinking straw but much worse than that.\\\" Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County medical examiner who conducted Floyd's autopsy and concluded that the manner of death was a homicide, will also be called to testify for the prosecution. The defense is expected to call its own medical experts to counter the state's arguments."},{"author":"Tasneem Nashrulla","title":"Police Chief Testifies Against Derek Chauvin Use Of Force","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/tasneemnashrulla\/derek-chauvin-trial-police-chief-testimony-george-floyd","content":"Top-ranking police officials from the Minneapolis Police Department, including the city\\u2019s police chief, have testified that former officer Derek Chauvin\\u2019s use of force against George Floyd was unnecessary and violated policy and training protocols. In a rare occurrence of police officers going against one of their own, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, Lt. Richard Zimmerman, and Chauvin\\u2019s now-retired former supervisor, Sgt. David Pleoger, testified against him during his murder trial in the killing of Floyd. Arradondo, who joined the department in 1989 and steadily rose through the ranks to become the city\\u2019s first Black police chief three years ago, gave damaging testimony against the former officer on Monday, saying he \\u201Cvehemently disagreed\\u201D with Chauvin\\u2019s use of force against Floyd during his arrest on May 25, 2020. \\u201CThere\\u2019s an initial reasonableness in trying to get him under control in the first few seconds,\\u201D Arradondo told the jury. \\u201CBut once there was no longer any resistance \\u2014 and clearly when Mr. Floyd was no longer responsive and even motionless \\u2014 to continue to apply that level of force to a person prone down, handcuffed behind their back \\u2026 that in no way, shape, or form is part of our policy, is not part of our training, and is not part of our ethics and values.\\u201D Chauvin\\u2019s defense strategy is that Floyd\\u2019s use of drugs and underlying medical conditions contributed to his death and that the officer's actions were consistent with police training and policies. However, Arradando told the court that Chauvin\\u2019s action of pressing his knee on Floyd\\u2019s neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds \\u201Cabsolutely\\u201D violated the department's use-of-force policy and went against its \\u201Cethics and values.\\u201D \\u201CThat is not part of our policy,\\u201D Arradando told the jury when shown the now-viral image of Chauvin looking up while putting Floyd in a knee chokehold. \\u201CThat is not what we teach.\\u201DArradando said that Chauvin\\u2019s actions did not constitute \\u201Cobjectively reasonable force\\u201D and that the neck restraint he used on Floyd was not taught to officers as part of their training. \\u201CWhen I look at this image and when I look at the facial expression of Mr. Floyd, that does not appear in any way, shape, or form that is light to moderate pressure,\\u201D Arradondo testified in court. Another high-ranking police official, Inspector Katie Blackwell, who until recently was the commander of the department's training division, also testified that Chauvin\\u2019s neck restraint was not consistent with police training. \\u201CI don\\u2019t know what kind of improvised position this is,\\u201D she said referring to Chauvin putting his knee on Floyd\\u2019s neck. \\u201CThis is not what we train.\\u201D The police chief said Chauvin should have stopped restraining Floyd as soon as he had stopped resisting and \\u201Ccertainly once when he was in distress and trying to verbalize.\\u201D Videos showed Floyd crying out multiple times that he could not breathe and that he was going to die. Several bystanders testified last week about seeing Floyd become unconscious and \\u201Climp\\u201D as Chauvin continued to dig his knee into his neck. According to Arradondo, Chauvin also violated department policies by not rendering medical aid to Floyd when officers could not find a pulse as well by failing to deescalate the situation. \\u201CThat action is not deescalation,\\u201D Arradondo said. \\u201CWhen we talk about our framework of the sanctity of life and the principles and values of life, that action goes contrary to what we\\u2019re talking about.\\u201D His statements echoed what two other department officials testified as witnesses for the prosecution last week. Zimmerman, the head of the department's homicide division and the most senior officer on the force, testified on Friday that the force Chauvin used on Floyd was \\\"totally unnecessary\\\" and \\u201Cuncalled for.\\u201D He said that in more than 30 years of training at the department, he had never been trained to press his knee against the neck of a subject to restrain him. \\u201CThat would be considered top-tier deadly force because of the fact that if you kneel on a person\\u2019s neck that can kill him,\\u201D Zimmerman told the jury.Zimmerman, who responded to the scene hours after Floyd had been transported to the hospital, said Chauvin\\u2019s action of using his knee to crush his neck for so long went too far. \\\"First of all, pulling [Floyd] down to the ground facedown and putting your knee on the neck for that amount of time is just uncalled for,\\u201D Zimmerman said. \\u201CI saw no reason why the officers felt they were in danger, if that\\u2019s what they felt, and that\\u2019s what they would have to feel to be able to use that kind of force.\\u201D Like Arradondo, Zimmerman testified that Chauvin should have ended his restraint of Floyd once he was handcuffed and lying prone on the ground. Chauvin\\u2019s former supervisor, Pleoger, also testified last week that officers should have \\u201Cended the restraint\\u201D when Floyd was \\u201Cno longer offering any resistance to the officers.\\\" Citing department training, both Arradondo and Zimmerman said that officers should move subjects who are handcuffed in the prone position to their side or have them sit up \\u201Cas soon as possible\\u201D to avoid the danger of constricting their breathing or what is known as \\u201Cpositional asphyxia.\\u201D Both the veteran cops said that department officers are obligated to provide medical assistance to a distressed subject in custody even after they have called an ambulance and even while they are using defensive tactics against the subject. \\u201CThey\\u2019re still in our custody, and they have rights and the humanity of this profession. We need to make sure we\\u2019re protecting them,\\u201D Arradondo said. Multiple witnesses testified that apart from checking Floyd\\u2019s pulse, the four officers involved in his arrest did not provide any medical aid to him after he appeared to be unresponsive and motionless. Chauvin continued to press his knee on Floyd\\u2019s neck even after the ambulance arrived and while a paramedic checked for his pulse, according to videos and witnesses\\u2019 testimonies. An emergency care doctor who pronounced Floyd dead at the hospital testified Monday that for every minute a patient in cardiac arrest does not receive CPR, their chance of survival decreases by 10% to 15%. He said Floyd had been in cardiac arrest for at least 30 minutes before he arrived at the hospital. In his cross-examination of the Minneapolis Police Department officials, Chauvin\\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, asked them about whether an increasingly \\u201Chostile\\u201D crowd of bystanders that was growing bigger and angrier at the officers\\u2019 actions would affect their decisions on the use of force and deescalation.Zimmerman testified that the bystanders who witnessed Floyd take his last breaths under the weight of Chauvin\\u2019s knee did not appear to be \\u201Can uncontrollable threat\\u201D to the officers at the scene. He said the crowd should not have an effect on officers\\u2019 actions \\u201Cas long as they\\u2019re not attacking\\u201D the officers. Arradondo said that, per department policy, bystanders were allowed to express their First Amendment rights and record officers\\u2019 actions but not \\u201Cphysically\\u201D obstruct them. He agreed that one way to deescalate a crow experiencing something shocking would be for the officers to stop doing the thing that\\u2019s shocking to them. During his testimony, the police chief emphasized the \\u201Csanctity of life\\u201D being the most important aspect when officers use force against people. \\u201COf all the things we do as police officers for the Minneapolis Police Department, the thousands of calls we respond to, it is my firm belief that one single incident we will forever be judged on will be our use of force,\\u201D Arradando said. \\u201CWhile it is absolutely imperative that our officers go home at the end of their shift, we want to make sure our community members do too.\\u201D"},{"author":"Tom Namako","title":"Peloton Treadmill Child Death Warning From Government","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/tomnamako\/peloton-tread-child-died-warning-government","content":"The US government is warning people against exercising on Peloton's treadmill when children are around or letting children near it when it's not in use, saying the equipment could pose \\\"serious risks to children for abrasions, fractures, and death.\\\" \\u201CAny consumer using the Peloton Tread+ who has or could have a pet, child, or object around this device, this warning is for you,\\\" said Joseph Martyak, director of communications for the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. The company called the warning \\\"inaccurate and misleading.\\\" The warning came after Peloton CEO John Foley revealed in March that a treadmill, which the company calls a Tread+, killed a child. \\\"I recently learned about a tragic accident involving a child and the Tread+, resulting in, unthinkably, a death. While we are aware of only a small handful of incidents involving the Tread+ where children have been hurt, each one is devastating to all of us at Peloton,\\\" Foley wrote at the time. And on Saturday the company said it learned in March that another \\\"child had experienced a brain injury. Peloton spoke to the family who reported that and the child is expected to fully recover.\\\" On Saturday the CPSC said it \\\"is aware of 39 incidents including one death\\\" and is \\\"continuing to investigate all known incidents of injury or death related to the Peloton Tread+.\\\" Peloton said it's providing information to the agency. \\\"In light of multiple reports of children becoming entrapped, pinned, and pulled under the rear roller of the product, CPSC urges consumers with children at home to stop using the product immediately,\\\" the agency said, and included a video of a child's arms getting pinned under a Tread (warning: the video might be disturbing to some) while playing near the device. \\\"It is believed that at least one incident occurred while a parent was running on the treadmill, suggesting that the hazard cannot be avoided simply by locking the device when not in use,\\\" the CPSC said. Peloton said the treadmill is safe if people follow the safety instructions and said the CPSC \\\"has thus far refused to collaborate with Peloton.\\\" \\\"Peloton warns members not to let children use the Tread+ and to keep children, pets, and objects away from the Tread+ at all times,\\\" the company said in response. It also said people need to remove the safety key when not using the treadmill, \\\"precisely to avoid the kind of incident that this video depicts.\\\" \\\"Since receiving the March 18 message from Peloton, members have also shared other ways to keep children safe during home workouts. They schedule workouts during nap time or at night when children are asleep. Or they have a spouse or partner watch the children in another room.

It\\u2019s 1995, and I\\u2019m in seventh-grade keyboarding class. The school computer lab has clunky greige Apple computers loaded with Mavis Beacon software. We dutifully practice placing our fingers on the \\u201Chome row\\u201D: the left hand on ASDF, right on JKL;. We practice typing short words, then sentences, aiming for accuracy and speed while keeping those fingers on the home row. This goes on once a week for three months. The class is easy. I get a decent grade. Then we switch to Health class, which is much more exciting because it talks about s-e-x. Because it\\u2019s 1995, health class spends a lot of time teaching about contraceptive foam and the sponge. Neither the sponge nor the home row method will serve me in my adult life.II. It\\u2019s the week that vaccines become available to New Yorkers age 30+, and I\\u2019m venting to friends in a group chat that I haven\\u2019t been able to book an appointment online yet. \\u201CThat\\u2019s because Katie is probably typing in that she lives in BROKOLYN NWE YROK,\\u201D one ex-friend jokes. My bad typing is a running meme among my friends and coworkers who are routinely subjected to my typos over Slack, email, or iMessage. In this article, of course, you see nothing but perfect prose, thanks to the magic of spellcheck and copy editors. But when I\\u2019m typing quickly in a fast-moving chat, it\\u2019s chaos. I\\u2019m bad at typing. Not so much that I\\u2019m slow (although I\\u2019m not fast, either), but my accuracy is garbage. I use some mangled half-version of touch typing, sometimes looking at the keys, using *most* of my fingers, but definitely not the home row.And so I decide I need to embark on a journey to fix the sins of seventh grade. I will teach myself to type. I will learn at the feet of the masters, champions of speed and accuracy. I will figure out why I made so many typos in the first place. Is it my fingers or my brain? My long nails? Am I just a big dummy? Genetically bad at typing? Is it my computer\\u2019s fault or my keyboard\\u2019s? In order to catch a typo, I had to go undercover. I had to become\\u2026a typo.III. \\u201CQWERTY was invented before touch typing or the home row method was, so people think you\\u2019re supposed to type by centering your fingers on the home row, but when you realize it\\u2019s basically just based on the first half of the alphabet that doesn\\u2019t make any sense. \\u2026 Additionally, home row does not support the anatomy of the human hand, where the middle three fingers on each hand want to stretch further than the pinkies and the thumbs do. By forcing your longer fingers onto the home row, you\\u2019re creating some needless friction that will probably slow you down too.\\u201D \\u2014Sean Wrona, 35, of Syracuse, New York. First-ever winner of the Ultimate Typing Championship in 2010, runner-up in 2021. IV. Let\\u2019s be clear about what typos are. Typos are keyboarding mistakes \\u2014 accidental strokes that would only happen on a computer, not writing mistakes. Misspellings or mixing up \\u201Cthey\\u2019re\\u201D and \\u201Ctheir\\u201D is a writing mistake, not a typo. Autocorrect mistakes, especially on phones, aren\\u2019t typos either. \\u201CDuck you, you ducking duck\\u201D isn\\u2019t the result of a misfired finger placement. There are different kinds of typos. One is \\u201Cfat fingering\\u201D: accidentally hitting the key next to the letter you meant to type, like the classic example of \\u201Cpwn\\u201D instead of \\u201Cown.\\u201D A different version is when you switch letters inside a word, like \\u201Cteh\\u201D for \\u201Cthe.\\u201D This isn\\u2019t a misspelling \\u2014 you know how to spell \\u201Cthe.\\u201D In this case, your fingers went for the wrong key at the wrong time, and you got tripped up by two hands \\u2014 the \\u2018H\\u2019 with your right hand and \\u2018E\\u2019 with your left. I don\\u2019t switch the letters inside a word because I don\\u2019t know how to spell, or even because I have some form of dyslexia that would make me think those letters should be switched. I would never write \\u201Cteh\\u201D when writing with a pencil and paper. The error isn\\u2019t in my cognitive understanding of how the word should look; it\\u2019s a slip-up of my brain telling my left finger to move faster than the right. Perhaps my problem then is an issue of coordination between left and right. Based on my utter inability to follow dance instructions that tell me when to move my left foot, this seems a likely culprit. Could the root of all my typos be some sort of malfunction in my brain sending the signals to my hands?V. A 68-year-old woman had an ongoing eye twitch and other facial muscle spasms. She had been receiving Botox injections to help, but that had become less effective over time. Doctors performed bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation, a kind of neurosurgery used to treat uncontrollable movements or tremors that come with Parkinson\\u2019s disease. Small electrodes are inserted into an area of the brain that controls motor function, then a separate device is implanted in the chest that sends electrical impulses into the brain to regulate the movements. Her procedure was successful, but it left a strange side effect: She completely forgot how to touch type. A former administrative office worker who did lots of typing, she was reduced to hunt and peck, struggling to type even a single word in a minute. Although not an official diagnosis, doctors and researchers refer to this phenomenon as \\u201Cdystypia\\u201D \\u2014 a disruption of the ability to type on a keyboard. A similarly modern phenomenon is \\u201Cdystextia,\\u201D where someone has trouble typing on a phone. Both dyslexia and dystypia are usually observed by doctors treating patients who have suffered a stroke. Dr. Joshua Wong, a neurologist at the University of Florida, observed the woman and published a paper about her unusual case. According to Wong, it\\u2019s impossible to pinpoint one part of the brain that might be responsible for typing or dystypia. \\u201CThe physical act of typing requires communication among different regions of the cerebral cortex: one for visual input, one for physical motor strength, one for motor coordination, one for planning, etc\\u2026\\u201D he told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CThese regions communicate with each other via the circuits \\u2014 called \\u2018white matter tracts.\\u2019 It is currently thought that dystypia is caused by disruption of one tract called the superior longitudinal fasciculus.\\u201D In another case, a Japanese man in his sixties had a stroke affecting his left frontal lobe. He had no other problem writing by hand or reading, but his typing was impaired. Researchers thought the disruption to two parts of the left frontal lobe could be to blame.\\u201CI like to think of it as: If you are trying to watch TV but there is something wrong with the cable cord, you might end up with a distorted image, laggy audio, or even lose signal completely for a bit,\\u201D Dr. Wong said. The act of typing \\u2014 either fluid touch typing or making mistakes \\u2014 is a miracle of our brains. Dr. Tom Stafford, a cognitive scientist at the University of Sheffield in the UK, has studied typing, most recently in typing tests as a possible way to detect Parkinson\\u2019s disease. \\u201CYou have to think that typing, although something we do every day, is an incredibly complex skill,\\u201D Stafford told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CYou have to coordinate what you want to say, find the words to say it, and move your fingers to the right keys. Fast typists are hitting multiple keys per second.\\u201D \\u201CPerhaps it is surprising there aren\\u2019t more mistakes,\\u201D said Stafford. VI. No place on the internet sees more typos than the search box of Google. Pandu Nayak, vice president of Search at Google, has seen it all in his 16 years (people enter over 10,000 variations of the word \\u201CYouTube\\u201D). According to Nayak, about 1 in 10 searches on Google has some sort of error. One of the earliest features added to the search engine in 2001 was \\u201CDid you mean,\\u201D which solves the biggest typo problems.\\u201CThere\\u2019s a number of reasons why people do this,\\u201D Nayak told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CMaybe they interchange letters or drop a letter because they didn\\u2019t hit the key hard enough. Or they hit the wrong key. The keyboard layout means you mean to hit the \\u2018J\\u2019 but hit \\u2018K\\u2019 instead. People who touch type, sometimes they are in the wrong position and every letter is one key shifted to the left.\\u201D These are all a form of typos, slips of the fingers. But Google also has to take into account misspellings, like \\u201Cresteraunts near me\\u201D or phonetic spellings like \\u201Cfewsha\\u201D for fuschia. \\u201CNeural networks have helped really give better results because it adds much more context,\\u201D he said. \\u201CLet\\u2019s say you search \\u2018average home coast.\\u2019 If you searched \\u2018home coast,\\u2019 that might not be a typo. But since you searched \\u2018average home coast,\\u2019 it\\u2019s more obvious that it\\u2019s probably average home COST.\\u201D According to Nayak, the neural network technology that powers Search and the \\u201CDid you mean\\u201D feature doesn\\u2019t take into account whether something is a typo versus a misspelling or homonym. No one at Google has programmed in a code that tells if that \\u201CA is next to S on the keyboard, so take that into account for typos.\\u201D The technology is much more advanced, where deep learning and neural networks are able to use context to parse human folly. Over the last two decades of Google search, the way we search has changed, but oddly one statistic has stayed constant: About 10% of all searches have some error or typo. This rate has remained the same even as the number of searches is now in the billions per day. In the last few years, searches are more frequently in natural language with longer strings of text (\\u201Chow long is the Nile River\\u201D instead of just \\u201CNile\\u201D), so you\\u2019d expect typos to rise. But this is mitigated by a feature that stops misspelled and typo\\u2019d searches before they ever happen: the autosuggest box. If you start typing in \\u201CArnold S,\\u201D you\\u2019re shown the correct spelling of the Governator in a drop-down menu, which you can hit before ever making an erroneous search for \\u201CArnold Shwzareaneger.\\u201D Nayak pointed out that plenty of people actually use both of these as a type of spellcheck, something I\\u2019ve certainly done \\u2014 I often will google the name of a website (\\u201Cbuzzfed\\u201D) into the browser tab and click through the search result instead of entering the actual URL, which requires precise typing. The beauty of Google\\u2019s advances in language processing and machine learning is that it saves me the hassle of having to have paid attention in seventh-grade keyboarding class. It doesn\\u2019t matter that I make typos in Google, Google will help me out. Unlike my friends, it won\\u2019t mock me; it accepts me as I am. I bring my whole self to the Google search box. There are a few other big innovations from the last 15 years we take for granted. Autocomplete on our phones saves us from the complications of big fingers on tiny phones. Spellcheck, once a distinct program you ran at the very end of typing on Microsoft Word, is now baked into not just word processing but our browsers. In 1995 \\u2014 the same year I took my seventh-grade keyboarding class \\u2014 Microsoft Word debuted that wavy red \\u201Csquiggle\\u201D under a misspelled word, which means we tend to fix all our typos as soon as they happen.In many ways, there\\u2019s no need to be a fast or even good typist anymore. Technology has solved typing for us. Sure, there are a few jobs where speedy and accurate typing is a core function of the job, but most schlubs like me can muddle through just fine with spellcheck and autocomplete. Only one woman, Kathy Chiang, was in the 10 finalists of the 2020 Ultimate Typing Championship. This is most likely due to the nature of the self-selecting cohort that enters an online typing competition rather than the innate abilities of men versus women. In the previous century, speed typing was the domain of women, who made up most of the secretary and typist jobs. In 1985, David Letterman had the world\\u2019s fastest typist, Barbara Blackburn, as a guest on his show, where she performed a race against the fastest typist on staff at his show, a production assistant also named Barbara, who is appearing on camera for the first time ever. Blackburn was a grandmother who worked in an insurance office and typed as fast as 180 words per minute, making it into The Guinness Book of World Records. During Letterman\\u2019s head-to-head, there\\u2019s an upset: Blackburn\\u2019s typewriter has a malfunction, and the production assistant wins. Perhaps speed typing, like cooking or clothing design, is seen as the domain of women until men decide to do it at elite levels. It\\u2019s quite possible that overall, young men are outpacing young women in typing speeds in large part to practice from video games. But there are still subtle gendered parts of fast typing: Think about who in your office is asked to take notes during a meeting because they\\u2019re the fastest typist. VII. \\u201CI recall some of my classmates complimenting my typing speed in classes throughout elementary school, but I never really took any of that to heart. Even if I were the fastest in the room, I knew that didn't necessarily mean I was fast elsewhere. It wasn't until my freshman year of college that a friend noticed how quickly I typed and convinced me to take an online typing test. When I noticed my percentile and how I was showing up on leaderboards, I finally believed that my speed was actually pretty impressive.\\u201D \\u2014Kathy Chiang, 28, of California. Fourth-place runner-up in 2020 Ultimate Typing Championship.XIII. \\u201CIt used to be hard to type with long nails, but now if I have short nails, it\\u2019s too hard lol.

All my clients tell me the same thing.\\u201D \\u2014Britney Tokyo, LA-based nail artist who has done nails for the Kardashians, Rita Ora, Katy Perry, and Miley Cyrus IX. When all else fails, I like to blame the equipment. Different keyboards can indeed affect the way you type. Apple\\u2019s butterfly keyboards were so maligned that it finally did away with them. Up until 2012, I used a mechanical keyboard for work \\u2014 a classic black clickity-clack keyboard with a big number pad and lots of crumbs from my desk lunches that fell out when I shook it upside down, and sometimes a key might pop off. Truly a thing of beauty: a big, disgusting, loud keyboard. Bellissimo! Years later, typing on a mechanical keyboard is Proust\\u2019s madeleine for me. It reminds me of my old office job, entering data on the number pad into spreadsheets. It reminds me of the HP Gateway desktop in the cow print box I had in college, which then reminds me of the one time the \\u201Cdude, you\\u2019re getting a Dell\\u201D actor asked me for a light for his cigarette standing outside one of our college buildings (we attended at the same time), my favorite anecdote of a brush with a minor celebrity. The subreddit r\\\/MechanicalKeyboards has close to a million members, sharing photos of their custom keyboards and trading tips. People aren\\u2019t just fans of old ones \\u2014 they buy special colored keys with unique click sounds and tap pressures. My brother-in-law happens to be one of these nerds. I asked him to borrow one of his mechanical keyboards recently, figuring he might have an extra one laying around. Instead, he opened a cupboard in his office, revealing over a dozen customized mechanical keyboards in varying colors he had made for himself. (I don\\u2019t want to judge anyone\\u2019s hobby but...I don\\u2019t get it.) He warned me, \\u201CYou\\u2019re going to think this will make you type faster, but instead it\\u2019s going to make you think you need to see a doctor.\\u201D It did feel very different: Each key pressed down much farther, which combined with the loud clacking sounds made me feel like my fingers were tripping over each other while running down a dark basement hallway in a horror movie. When I tested it out on TypingTest.com, I actually did worse: 47 words per minute instead of 53 with my regular keyboard. New equipment wasn\\u2019t going to help me. X. Daniel Guermeur came to the US to study computer science at Stanford University as a grad student in the late 1980s. One part of the culture shock he didn\\u2019t anticipate was that all his classmates were much better and faster at typing than he was. Back in France, he never took typing in school like American kids did, and a lot of his friends typed by hunt and peck. \\u201CAmerican people type well; they touch type,\\u201D he told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CAlso people from Israel, the UK, Italy. Now, there\\u2019s still no typing classes in France or Germany. I look at my family and friends typing on a keyboard and see they use their two index fingers.\\u201D Now, when he has interns from France, he makes sure they take the time to learn to touch type. Guermeur knows a lot about typing; he is the founder of Das Keyboard, a mechanical keyboard manufacturer. There are about 12 models of Das Keyboard, ranging in price from about $120 to $200 for one that has glowing light-up keys that you can program to alert you about things like calendar notifications or emails. Guermeur said that Das Keyboards are \\u201Clike the BMWs of keyboards.\\u201D (According to my hobbyist brother-in-law, keyboards can get a lot more expensive than that. Steve Jobs\\u2019 famously snide remake about certain Porsche models being what dentists drive comes to mind.) XI. It\\u2019s 2010, and Das Keyboard has sponsored the first Ultimate Typing Championship at South by Southwest in Austin. Sean Wrona, from upstate New York, has been flown out after winning a semifinal round by trouncing his rivals on TyprX.com. On the convention center floor, Wrona obliterates his rival in front of a crowd of lanyard-wearing onlookers. In a post-match interview, he admits he was frustrated because in the second round he only got 124 words per minute, a slow speed for himself. Wrona holds up a giant novelty-sized check for $2,000, smiling and shaking hands in his black Das Keyboard shirt.XII. It may not totally shock you to learn that people who choose to enter speed typing competitions are a bit on the, erm, nerdy side. Wrona holds degrees in computer science and economics from Cornell. One of his friends in the typing world is Jelani Nelson, an engineering and applied sciences professor at Harvard, who at one point could top 170 words per minute (Nelson told me he tried to enter the 2020 Ultimate Typing Championship but didn\\u2019t place well). Wrona isn\\u2019t just a fast typist \\u2014 he thinks a lot about the nature of typing. In an email to me about his typing technique, he mentioned theories of typing from a 1936 book about typing psychology. He does not do traditional touch typing; he has his own method. \\u201CI did not learn to type from anyone in a class and I think that is in part why I am faster because the way people are taught to type in typing classes is wrong,\\u201D he told me over email. \\u201CI was gifted in mental arithmetic, and I do believe there is some kind of connection between typing skills, math skills, music skills, and computer skills, but that might simply be because the fastest typists also use computers a lot,\\u201D Wrona told me. \\u201CHowever, Albert Tangora, one of the most famous typing champions from the '20s and '30s was also known for mental arithmetic and that was during the mechanical typewriter era.\\u201D In fact, most of the other top typists don\\u2019t use the home row, either. Emre Aydin from the UK didn\\u2019t have typing classes in his school and described his self-taught technique: \\u201CMy left hand doesn\\u2019t move as much but the fingers do a lot of work (with my left thumb on the space bar as a \\u2018stabiliser\\u2019 of sorts), while my right hand does move around quite a fair amount. I use all my fingers except my right thumb and unlike home row which encourages typing certain keys with the same fingers, the fingers I end up using are often optimized to the nearest comfortable finger where my hand is positioned at the time.\\u201D Brandon Vielle, who tied for fifth in 2020, also has his own technique: \\u201CI had to work at a deficit \\u2014 having formerly only used 1\\u20132 fingers on my right hand, and adapted a much more momentum-focused \\u2018clawgrip\\u2019 style of typing, that I slowly refined by adding more of a \\u2018combo\\u2019-touch. Which is why, like some other typists, my index would move quite a bit.\\u201D Vielle\\u2019s description of overcoming hunt and peck is slightly selling himself short. He was also a sort of typing wunderkind, clocking in over 70 wpm in elementary school. XIII. For as much as my friends make fun of me for being bad at typing, I\\u2019m not that bad. On an online typing test, I clocked in at a respectable 47 words per minute. That\\u2019s not fast, but it\\u2019s not slow, and several of my colleagues at BuzzFeed were around the same speed (the fastest typist in the newsroom is a gamer who has one of those gamer chairs that look like Lightning McQueen). I attempted to relearn touch typing. I signed up for online typing lessons at TypingClub.com, which promised to reteach me to use the home row. Its exercises started out with just \\u201CFJFJFJF\\u201D (the positions for the two index fingers) over and over, then the next set of keys for the middle fingers, then ring finger, and pinky, then finally trying to mix them up.I thought this would be fun, but I found it extremely unpleasant and arduous. Trying to type unfamiliar strings of \\u201Casdfjkl;\\u201D hurt my brain in a strange way; seeing the red marks where I made mistakes made me angry. I felt a feeling similar to one of my least favorite sensations of trying to play Super Mario for the first time as a kid and continually not being able to hit the correct buttons to make him jump at the right time. I hated it. Somehow, this was more demoralizing than the constant ridicule of my friends. I\\u2019m ashamed to say after a few days of TypingClub, I gave up. My speed hadn\\u2019t improved at all. XIV. Maybe the new frontier of typing isn\\u2019t typing at all. Not everyone has fingers, not everyone has the ability to move their fingers easily. Accessibility for people with decreased mobility or sensation or prosthetics is already underway. Facebook recently announced that it\\u2019s working on a wrist device that can sense the brain\\u2019s signals to your fingers to tell what keys you want to type \\u2014 essentially letting you typing without a keyboard (a Facebook executive insisted to me that this is not Facebook \\u201Creading your thoughts,\\u201D which is fine because Facebook already knows enough about you that it definitely doesn\\u2019t need to read your thoughts).This opens the possibility of typing without typos \\u2014 if you\\u2019re typing straight from your mind, there\\u2019s no chance of accidentally hitting the wrong key. We\\u2019re just a few years away from human error in typing being a pesky relic of the past, our thoughts beamed from our minds to our smart glasses to our wrists. I may have failed at my quest to become a better typist, but maybe it doesn\\u2019t matter. For now, I have spellcheck, I have autocorrect, I\\u2019m physically capable of typing, and I have a job where someone else is in charge of copyediting this (thanks, Sarah). And maybe soon, where we\\u2019re going, there are no typos. ●"},{"author":"Katherine Miller","title":"Let\u2019s Celebrate The Moment You Get Vaccinated","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/katherinemiller\/vaccine-selfie-pfizer-moderna","content":"Here was the scene at the Javits Center, one of this country\\u2019s mass vaccination sites, last Saturday: people walking snaking lines of constant motion through a giant glass warehouse in New York, producing the kind of ambient, enveloping hum of conversation that you never hear anymore because of the pandemic. At the very front of the line, when the last National Guard member directed people to numbered tables across the floor to receive their shots, he offered any couple their assignment and then: \\u201CTogether forever!\\u201D Then, everyone got shots. We got stickers, we sat in black folding chairs spaced and faced in one direction, and, after a calm 15 minutes, we all got up and left. So there at this epic site constructed for the cheerful, industrial delivery of shots, the scene was still a little disparate, interior, and mostly silent, an individual experience done concurrently \\u2014 no swell of community, no hot music. Many people have been a little muted or brief about celebrating their own vaccinations; there are a dozen deep and good reasons I can imagine for it, and first among them a hyper-awareness that each of us is so small a portion of the country that\\u2019s seen so many horrible deaths. And relief is hard to quantify. But for just a moment, I would like to dwell on the moment. It really is this weird thing to walk into a CVS or a high school cafeteria or what looks like an Avengers complex theme park ride likely by yourself, EXPERIENCE A TRANSFORMATIVE MOMENT of this century, sit in silence for 15 minutes, then likely leave by yourself, externally unchanged into the unchanged world. Four-point-six million people got vaccinated last Saturday in the United States. Forever, I will want to hear about you getting vaccinated: family, friends, total strangers, friends of strangers, those emergency nurses and doctors back in December and January, elderly musicians, someone\\u2019s beloved aunt. Let\\u2019s hear it. Imagine Pac-Man with the dots, but he\\u2019s chasing vaccine photos, and the decisive moment when someone\\u2019s life returns to them. Imagine little Super Mario chimes popping off every second across the entire United States \\u2014 like that ca-ching, ca-ching, ca-ching \\u2014 like one of those maps where all the lights ping on, like old some telephone or airline ad where every city and town lights up. Sometimes it\\u2019s like I can\\u2019t even believe the pandemic has happened. And nothing comparatively bad has even happened to me during this time, except that I have been alive during the pandemic, which has transformed life into an abyss and infused society with an unbearable, sprawling grief that will snake far beyond it. So here we arrive at this instant, mundane act of receiving a shot in the face of the grim past and present. But it\\u2019s way more than that, obviously. In ten seconds, it\\u2019s the intersection of something deep in your heart that only you can know, with the literal interior transformation of developing protections against the virus, with the true interconnected nature of society \\u2014 because we\\u2019re all really just little Lego pieces clicking into place in a giant fence around the virus. It\\u2019s WILD, in the very best unbelievable way, what the scientists and everyone\\u2019s been able to do in this year of all-enveloping darkness to invent these vaccines and produce them. Confetti, balloons, cherry blossoms and wisteria from trees, hot music from the 2000s, stars should fall on these people, forever. Start back at the beginning with the messenger RNA vaccines. The big driver in part of that research, Kati Karikó, left Communist Hungary with less than $2,000 sewn into a teddy bear and the big academic research apparatus \\u2014 for years \\u2014 didn\\u2019t go for her pitches for messenger RNA research, she had ideas that didn\\u2019t pan out and lost out professionally, until it all came together! \\u201CMy dream was always that we develop something in the lab that helps people,\\u201D her research collaborator, Drew Weissman, said. \\u201CI\\u2019ve satisfied my life\\u2019s dream.\\u201D Decades ago Barney Graham, now at the NIH and behind one of the other big-gun developments that make these vaccines work, was trying to understand why a vaccine trial in the 1960s had gone so wrong \\u2014 and heard all the time, Why are you bothering with coronaviruses? \\u201CBarney, it looks like it\\u2019s working.\\u201D That\\u2019s how he got the news about the earliest results! Then you\\u2019ve got this billionaire scientist couple in Germany at BioNTech riding bikes to and from the lab, pushing forward with an mRNA vaccine with Pfizer, and the Moderna executive who wept with his family when their research results came back. Then you\\u2019ve got all these people up in upstate New York and down in Auburn, Alabama, making vials with these giant machines that you can see in these beautiful photos, and the people in Kalamazoo and Wisconsin and all the other places running lines filling those vials with formulated vaccines, then the people putting the vials into boxes and freezing them. You've got the people who signed up for the vaccine trials last year. You\\u2019ve got the people delivering these things. You\\u2019ve got the pharmacists who got more vaccine out of the vials than anticipated. You\\u2019ve got the people actually giving us the shots. You\\u2019ve got the people knocking on doors to sign people up and flagging down cars so nothing gets lost. The cafeteria worker who told one of the researchers at Pfizer that making lunch for the team made him feel like part of the vaccine effort? He was! All of this so 4.6 million people in a single day can experience an instant shot, done and over, and look and seem the same but be different afterward, and all the little dots all over the map can come to life. This news can be complicated, and living in reality requires complication \\u2014 that vaccines don\\u2019t bring people back, that the global pandemic will take a long time to end, that it\\u2019s going to be a challenging endeavor to persuade everyone to get these shots, that grim inequalities endure, that people may run out of time waiting, that in an environment where you couldn\\u2019t believe the last year how could you really ever feel confident about the future? But the complication and grief can concurrently deepen the good news of the vaccines, too. Even the issues being studied with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine underscore how enormous the achievements are, that the problems have been in such rare cases. If this double-edged dynamic were not so, getting vaccinated would be nothing \\u2014 just a mundane obligation on some afternoon when you could otherwise be doing anything else, rather than something you see the words \\u201CI cried\\u201D attached to again and again on Instagram. The nature of the thing, though, is that it\\u2019s brief and anticlimactic to get a shot, and the joint protect-yourself, protect-others venture is invisible. Society remains limited in literal capacity by the pandemic, and celebration in practice might begin and end with that Instagram post. But millions of times a day in the United States now, that moment is actually grand and populated, with the billionaire scientists riding their bikes around outside and the weeping executives and cafeteria cooks and vial-factory team, with the champagne and mezcal flowing and flowers falling, as each person clicks into place to someday end the terrible thing that\\u2019s happened. ●"},{"author":"Lauren Strapagiel","title":"Johnson & Johnson Vaccine Blood Clots Vs. Birth Control Ones","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/laurenstrapagiel\/johnson-covid-vaccine-blood-clots-birth-control","content":"With the news that the CDC and FDA have called for pausing the rollout of Johnson & Johnson\\u2019s single-injection COVID-19 vaccine due to extremely rare cases of blood clots, some have been drawing comparisons to the blood clot risk from hormonal birth control. But while the Pill is known to increase risk for blood clots, three doctors who spoke with BuzzFeed News said these are two very different scenarios. \\\"It\\u2019s not only not apples to apples, it\\u2019s basically apples to papayas. It is completely different,\\\" said Hanny al-Samkari, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a hematologist and clinical investigator at Massachusetts General Hospital. \\\"Yes, they both can cause clots \\u2014 just like apples and papayas are both fruits \\u2014 but the mechanisms are totally different.\\\" On Tuesday, the pause on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was recommended after six women between the ages of 18 and 48 developed a rare type of blood clot within 13 days of receiving the vaccine. One woman died and another is in critical care, according to the FDA. But approximately 6.85 million doses of the vaccine had been delivered in the US as of April 13, meaning the complication appears to affect fewer than 1 in a million recipients. These extremely rare blood clots are of a severe kind that appear to significantly raise the risk of a stroke. Al-Samkari noted that the key characteristic of these clots is a drop in blood platelet counts. Crucially, unlike other blood clots, the blood-thinning medication heparin is a dangerous treatment for patients with these clots. The rare clotting appears to be similar to what\\u2019s been seen in approximately 1 in 100,000 patients who received the AstraZeneca vaccine, which uses the same technology to immunize people against the disease caused by the coronavirus. The Pfizer and Moderna shots, which are also authorized in the US, use a different approach and have not resulted in any reports of blood clots, according to the FDA. While the clotting risk appears to be extremely low with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, a flurry of tweets has compared it to the risk of blood clots from hormonal birth control pills. According to the FDA, for every 10,000 women taking the Pill in a given year, between 3 and 9 will develop a blood clot, compared to between 1 and 5 women who are neither taking the Pill nor are pregnant. But, crucially, it's not the same clotting as that experienced by some with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. \\\"They could not be more different when we talk about the underlying mechanism,\\\" said al-Samkari.The typical blood clot linked to birth control is called deep vein thrombosis, a clot that develops in the leg but can break off and travel to the lungs. Those are usually treated with blood thinners. Federal health officials on Tuesday said part of the intent of the pause is to wave off that typical treatment in patients who received the Johnson & Johnson shot because it is ineffective on the linked blood clots. \\u201CThis [pause] is important to ensure that the health care provider community is aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan due to the unique treatment required with this type of blood clot,\\u201D the FDA said. Jeff Weitz, a thrombosis expert and professor at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, said another difference between the types of clotting was that someone with an underlying hereditary condition who takes the Pill can be more at risk for clotting. The FDA has noted that although the six women in the US who had serious clots after the Johnson & Johnson vaccine were of reproductive age, no known evidence links birth control use to an increased risk of a blood clot caused by this particular shot. According to information presented by the CDC on Wednesday, one of the six women was taking a combination birth control pill, and none were pregnant or postpartum. Based on those six cases, the risk of a blood clot issue from the vaccine remains much lower than that from taking hormonal birth control. That has some people wondering why there's been so much concern over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine when so many millions of people take hormonal birth control every day. The reason is that vaccines, especially for shots newly authorized on an emergency basis, have a higher safety requirement than other medicines that have long been in use. \\\"This is part of the robust monitoring system that we have in the United States,\\u201D said Jennifer Lighter, an infectious diseases specialist and hospital epidemiologist at NYU Langone Health. \\u201CThis is a good thing that we take serious adverse effects very seriously, and we pause and investigate. That\\u2019s what you want in a country that rolls out a new vaccine or medication.\\\" Lighter pointed out that the risk of dying from COVID-19 \\u2014 more than 563,000 deaths in the US have been attributed to the disease \\u2014 remains much higher than any risk of fatal complications after receiving a vaccine of any type. Al-Samkari said anyone who has received the Johnson & Johnson or AstraZeneca vaccine, particularly young women, should talk to a doctor if they \\\"start developing any significant, severe untoward symptom.\\\" He said symptoms like severe headache, sharp leg pains, or changes to the senses or nervous system that come on suddenly should be checked out. \\\"If it\\u2019s unusual and it\\u2019s out of the blue and it\\u2019s severe and it doesn\\u2019t go away, that\\u2019s when you want to see your doctor and get it evaluated immediately,\\\" he said. (People who had the shot a month ago are in the clear, federal health officials noted, because symptoms would have developed by now. The concern is chiefly among people who got the shot within the last few weeks.) Al-Samkari added that the precautions taken by regulators shouldn't scare people or make them hesitant to get vaccinated \\u2014 quite the opposite. \\\"The main message I tell people after seeing this is this should make everyone feel very comfortable,\\\" he said. \\\"If something was happening potentially related to a vaccination and our regulators were ignoring it or waving it off, that would be the danger place, that would be food for the anti-vaxxers. Things are happening just exactly as we want them to.\\\""},{"author":"Dan Vergano","title":"CDC Vaccine Panel Wants More Time To Vote On The Pause Of Johnson & Johnson Shots","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/danvergano\/cdc-panel-johnson-vaccine-pause","content":"An independent CDC expert panel on Wednesday put off a vote on whether the pause of Johnson & Johnson\\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine should continue, citing a need for data expected to come in the next two weeks on the shot\\u2019s links to an extremely rare and dangerous blood-clotting illness. The emergency session of the CDC\\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) panel was held after reports of six patients who developed blood clots after getting vaccinated. This led federal health officials on Tuesday to recommend \\u201Cout of an abundance of caution\\u201D that states pause their administrations of the shots. Asked to assess the shot\\u2019s safety, risks, and appropriate use, the panel punted the decision on whether it should be resumed for one to two more weeks, citing a lack of enough data beyond six confirmed cases reported by federal health officials on Tuesday. \\u201CWe are not ready to vote at this time,\\u201D said panel chair José Romero of the Arkansas Department of Health. Another meeting of the group will be scheduled by Friday. Their indecision reflects the thorny public health dilemma before regulators in the US as well as the rest of the world. A similar clotting syndrome has been reported among more than 100 recipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe, which uses a technology similar to J&J\\u2019s. The condition is thought to perhaps result from the vaccine triggering an allergic reaction against a protein in blood platelets under very rare circumstances, leading to blood clots that might cause strokes or other problems. Already, reports of clots have led some countries, including Italy, Spain, and Belgium, to restrict the use of the vaccine to older people, while the UK has said that healthy, young people who are not at high risk of COVID-19 should have the option of a different vaccine if one is available. In the US, the reports of alarming side effects from the J&J vaccine \\u2014 which has been given to about 7 million people since late February \\u2014 lead to tough questions: whether it is in the public\\u2019s overall best interest to continue to administer the shot, restrict it to some people, or cancel it altogether. On Wednesday, many ACIP panel members said they thought the best way to instill public trust would be to collect more data about the cases and underlying science before making a call. \\u201CBy having a little more robust information, I think we can be much more confident in how we talk about the safety of this vaccine,\\u201D said Lynn Bahta of the Minnesota Department of Health. \\u201CRight now the confidence for COVID vaccines is just right at a precipice. We\\u2019ve got people that can\\u2019t wait to get it, and others who have been waiting and seeing. This contributes to that confidence that people have.\\u201D But other members, even those who acknowledged that more data would be ideal, pointed out that hundreds of people are dying daily from COVID in the US, and that the single-shot J&J vaccine, which is easy to administer to people in hard-to-reach locations, was supposed to be a key tool in ending the pandemic. Some worried that extending the pause would be a death knell for the immunization. \\u201CPutting this vaccine on pause for those of us who are frontline workers has been devastating,\\u201D said Camille Kotton, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. \\u201CI agree in general that we don\\u2019t have enough data to make a decision at this time, but we were planning on using this vaccine in the state of Massachusetts for people who are homebound and otherwise not able to get a vaccine.\\u201D Suspending use of the vaccine for any period of time is a \\u201Csignificant loss\\u201D for those underserved populations, she said. FDA official Doran Fink suggested that the vaccine could continue to be distributed as long as doctors and recipients were better informed about the signs and risks of the clotting syndrome, so anyone experiencing the side effect could get the correct treatment right away. The option was discussed by the panel, but the experts felt uncomfortable embracing it for now. At a White House briefing earlier on Wednesday, federal officials said that enough doses of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are available to vaccinate the US population, even without the J&J shots. More than 192 million of those doses have been administered in the US in total and are continuing at a rate of 3.3 million a day. There are roughly 13 million doses of the J&J vaccine waiting for administration either at clinics or in delivery, according to the CDC. The side effects were reported after more than 6.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine had been given in the US. Of them, at least six women under the age of 50 have been reported to develop cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), or brain clots, along with low levels of blood platelets \\u2014 an unusual combination, since platelets are key to forming clots that stop bleeding. One of the women died, and three are still hospitalized. More cases may come to light over the next one to two weeks, CDC officials suggested at Wednesday\\u2019s meeting, given the two-week window in which cases have occurred so far. Symptoms of the cases included headaches, leg pain, backaches, and leg swelling.Representatives from Janssen, the pharmaceutical arm of J&J, relayed on Wednesday that the federal vaccine safety system had reported a likely seventh case in a 28-year-old woman, with details still being collected. Information on her platelet levels was not available at the time. In the six confirmed cases, which were detected by the US\\u2019s vaccine adverse event reporting system, the symptoms occurred 6 to 13 days after getting the shot, according to the CDC. The agency has called for doctors to watch out for patients developing blood clots or low blood platelet counts after getting the J&J vaccine. Typical treatment for this type of clot, a blood thinner called heparin, may harm patients and should be avoided, the agency warned. Heparin was given to four of the six women in question, three of whom had not recovered as of mid-April, Janssen said on Wednesday. It was not clear whether heparin caused the one death, CDC officials said. During J&J\\u2019s clinical trials, one vaccine recipient \\u2014 a 25-year-old man \\u2014 developed, then recovered from, similar symptoms to the clots now being reported. Both the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines rely on a harmless virus to deliver the coronavirus spike protein to immunize people, as do Russia's Sputnik vaccine and China\\u2019s CanSino Biologics vaccine. This \\\"adenovirus\\\" class of vaccines is particularly useful in immunization efforts because it only requires standard refrigeration and, in J&J\\u2019s case, just one shot. There is now concern that this class may uniformly carry a risk of clotting side effects, however \\u201Cextremely rare\\u201D they may be, as federal officials emphasized this week. No cases have been seen in earlier Ebola or respiratory syncytial virus vaccines that use the technology, according to Janssen. The technology is different from the one underpinning the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, both of which use mRNA to teach the body how to make a protein that triggers an immune response to the coronavirus. No cases of CVST with low blood platelets have been reported among people who have received Moderna or Pfizer vaccines. At Wednesday\\u2019s meeting, Janssen representatives argued in favor of continuing to administer the vaccine to the population at large while telling doctors about the symptoms and treatment of the clotting syndrome. \\u201CBased on the current data, Janssen believes the overall benefit-risk profile for our vaccine is positive across the population for which it\\u2019s authorized,\\u201D Aran Maree, Janssen\\u2019s chief medical officer, told the ACIP. But CDC official Sara Oliver put forth the case for extending the pause for a limited period of time or restricting the vaccine on the basis of gender or age, such as to only men or only people above age 50. She pointed out that the number of these blood clots reported so far, while still very rare, exceeds the number that would be expected to normally occur among young women. Oliver also noted that the country\\u2019s supply of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is expected to remain steady for the foreseeable future. \\u201CThe decision isn't necessarily receipt of a Janssen vaccine versus remaining at risk for COVID,\\u201D she said. \\u201CThe decision may be receipt of a Janssen vaccine versus receipt of another mRNA vaccine.\\u201D"},{"author":"Dan Vergano","title":"Empty Airplane Rows May Drop COVID-19 Risks 23% To 53%","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/danvergano\/empty-middle-row-airplane-travel-covid-flying","content":"Emptying airplane middle rows could limit passengers' exposure to the coronavirus during flights by a third, suggests a study released on Wednesday. The results from the new CDC and Kansas State University study come after Delta became the last major airline to end the practice of emptying middle row seats to physically distance passengers, starting May 1. \\\"Research suggests that seating proximity on aircraft is associated with increased risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2,\\\" begins the study led by the CDC's Watts Dietrich. However, just how much risk remains unclear.In the study, researchers approximated airborne dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 in airplane cabins with viruses that attack bacteria to simulate the coronavirus (these bacteriophages are harmless to people). Similar modeling has been used to gauge the risks of anthrax exposure on subways, for example, in the past. The airplane simulations showed a 23% reduction in exposure for the closest scenario: a person separated from an infected passenger by an empty middle seat, compared against sitting right next to them. For a simulation of three rows of airline seats, the reduction in exposure was 57% for passengers separated from infected ones by empty middle seats. Overall, the study suggested that emptying middle seats reduced the risk for all passengers from 35% to 39% on flights with one to three infected passengers. Worth noting, the study only looked at exposure to viral particles, not actual transmission of disease, where fully vaccinated people should be highly protected. The study also could not factor in the effects of masks in further cutting exposure risks, the researchers noted, but they cited some studies suggesting that masks don't block all viral particles released as aerosols by infected passengers. \\\"Combining the effects of masking and distancing is more protective than either by itself,\\\" they concluded. The CDC recommends against flying until you are fully vaccinated and mandates that air travelers wear masks while flying."},{"author":"Ellie Hall","title":"Prince Philip Funeral: Royal Family Gathers Amid COVID","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/ellievhall\/prince-philip-funeral-queen-william-charles-kate","content":"The Queen's husband of 73 years, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, was laid to rest Saturday in a ceremony at Windsor Castle that was both massively scaled down due to COVID-19 restrictions but still extraordinarily breathtaking. As a sole bagpiper played in a corridor just off the altar at St. George Chapel, Philip's casket, adorned with his sword, naval cap, and a wreath of flowers, was slowly lowered into the Royal Vault. There his body will rest along with 10 other sovereigns. Philip died April 9 at the age of 99. In the week since his death, members of the royal family have shared photos and other remembrances of his life and legacy, as husband to the sovereign and as a father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. Funeral attendees not only included those family members but some of his relatives from his own German and Greek family, such as his great-nephews Prince Philipp of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and Bernhard, Hereditary Prince of Baden. Due to the UK's COVID-19 regulations, only 30 people were allowed to attend the ceremony, excluding members of the clergy and pallbearers. The funeral was carried out \\\"according to the wishes\\\" of the duke, who had a hand in planning both the service itself \\u2014 including readings, a quartet choir accompanied by an organ, and eight trumpeters \\u2014 and the procession that included his children and grandchildren. Among other details, his coffin was transported to St. George's Chapel in a Land Rover that he helped design before his death. He personally chose all of the music that was performed at the funeral.One of the more closely watched elements of the funeral was the procession from one segment of the castle to the chapel. Nine members of the royal family walked behind the Land Rover. Leading the way were the Queen and Philip's eldest children, Prince Charles and Princess Anne, directly followed by siblings Prince Andrew and Prince Edward. Philip's eldest grandsons were next in line: Prince William, Duke of Cambridge; Anne's son Peter Phillips; and Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex. Anne's husband, Vice Admiral Tim Laurence, and Philip's nephew David Armstrong-Jones, the Earl of Snowdon, (Princess Margaret's son) walked behind the grandsons. Harry was the only one of Philip's grandchildren who attended the funeral without a spouse. It was the first time he was publicly seen alongside his family after an explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey where he accused members of being racist and mistreating his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. Meghan is pregnant with the couple's second child and was denied clearance to fly to the UK by her physician.

But that wasn\\u2019t the end of Stone\\u2019s legal troubles. On Friday, federal tax prosecutors filed a civil lawsuit against him in Florida claiming nearly $2 million in unpaid taxes. The government is alleging that Stone and his wife, Nydia Stone, owe more than $1.5 million in federal income taxes from 2007 to 2011 \\u2014 an amount that includes hundreds of thousands of dollars in late penalties and interest \\u2014 plus an additional $400,000 in unpaid income taxes and penalties from 2018 alone. Prosecutors are also accusing the Stones of placing more than $1 million into a corporate entity that their family controlled, Drake Ventures LLC, in 2018 and 2019 in order to keep it out of the hands of the IRS. The complaint alleges that the Stones used money from Drake Ventures to pay for personal expenses \\u2014 \\u201Cgroceries, dentist bills, spas, salons, clothing and restaurant expenses,\\u201D according to the government \\u2014 as well as make a down payment on a home, resolve some of their tax debt, and pay wages to relatives and other individuals without filing the required paperwork. \\u201CAlthough they used funds held in Drake Ventures accounts to pay some of their taxes, the Stones\\u2019 use of Drake Ventures to hold their funds allowed them to shield their personal income from enforced collection and fund a lavish lifestyle despite owing nearly $2 million in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties,\\u201D prosecutors wrote. If the phrase \\u201Clavish lifestyle\\u201D sounds familiar, it\\u2019s because prosecutors from former special counsel Robert Mueller\\u2019s team used the same language when they charged former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort with hiding millions of dollars in income in overseas bank accounts to avoid paying taxes and to finance an array of luxury purchases. Manafort was found guilty of tax and bank fraud but, like Stone, received a pardon from Trump in December 2020. The Stones made some efforts at resolving their tax debts, the government said. According to the latest complaint, they entered into an agreement with the IRS in May 2017 and began paying monthly installments of $19,485. But after Stone was charged by Mueller\\u2019s team in January 2019, the government said he and his wife arranged to purchase a condominium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in the name of a new trust they\\u2019d set up, the Bertran Family Revocable Trust, and used money from Drake Ventures. Prosecutors alleged the condo purchase was \\u201Cmarked by numerous badges of fraud,\\u201D noting that the Stones owed so much money to the US government at that point that they were \\u201Cinsolvent.\\u201D In March 2019, the Stones failed to make their monthly $19,485 payment to the IRS. That dissolved the installment agreement and opened them up to potential legal action. As his criminal case was pending and he was facing several private civil lawsuits, Stone publicly fundraised to support his legal defense, including taking paid speaking engagements at strip clubs. He also launched a \\u201CStone Family Support Fund\\u201D in mid-2019 to, as the Daily Beast reported at the time, cover \\u201Crent, food, medical expenses, insurance, gasoline, and the most basic of living expenses.\\u201D His legal defense fund website currently includes a message asking for money in anticipation of being charged in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol; he has not been criminally charged to date. The site doesn\\u2019t mention the tax liability. \\u201CWe lost our home, our savings, my car and most of our insurance in my epic fight for freedom list year. Being banned for life on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram has made it virtually impossible to sell my books online- my main source of income in the two years in which I awaited trial. I simply do not have the personal resources to fight yet another legal battle where I have done nothing whatsoever wrong,\\u201D Stone\\u2019s website reads. In response to the latest lawsuit, Stone provided a statement saying the claims were part of a \\\"smear campaign\\\" to tie him to the Jan. 6 riots (the lawsuit does not reference the events that day) and that it was \\\"laughable\\\" to say he was living a \\\"lavish lifestyle\\\" since he and his wife are \\\"virtually bankrupt.\\\" \\\"This case against me is motivated by blood lust and liberal hysteria over the fact that President Trump saw the clear corruption of my trial and had the strength and the courage to correct this injustice by issuing me a grant of clemency,\\\" Stone wrote."},{"author":"Ellie Hall","title":"Queen Shares New Photo Of Her And Husband Prince Philip In Scotland","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/ellievhall\/the-queen-shared-photo-prince-philip","content":"Buckingham Palace shared a never-before-seen private photograph of the Queen and Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, on Friday, the day before his funeral.

The city's Civilian Office of Police Accountability posted the videos online Thursday along with other recordings and police reports related to the shooting of Adam Toledo, following weeks of protest over the boy's killing and demands to release the body camera footage to the public. What the videos showed amounted to an \\\"assassination,\\\" Adeena Weiss-Ortiz, the Toledo family's attorney, said at a press conference Thursday evening. \\\"If you're shooting an unarmed child with his hands in the air, it is an assassination,\\\" she told reporters.On March 29, a police officer shot the boy to death in an alley in Chicago's Little Village neighborhood after a foot pursuit. Officers were responding to a call of shots fired when they chased Toledo and 21-year-old Ruben Roman, who officials said fired the initial gunshots that brought police to the area. As one officer tackled Roman, another ordered Toledo to stop, but the boy kept running, prosecutors said Saturday during a court hearing for Roman, who is now facing child endangerment and weapons charges. Toledo then paused, and the officer ordered him to show his hands. Footage from the body camera worn by the officer who fatally shot Toledo shows the cop running after him, yelling, \\u201CStop. Stop right fucking now.\\u201D \\u201CHands. Show me your fucking hands. Drop it,\\u201D the officer yells, according to the video. Two seconds after being ordered to raise his hands, the boy can be seen with his hands up as the officer fires one round, causing Toledo to fall backward to the ground at an opening along a fence. A gun is not visible in the body-worn video at the time of the shooting, which took place 20 seconds after the officer stepped out of his police car. After shooting, the officer runs toward the boy and radios for an ambulance. The video then shows officers attempting first aid over several minutes as Toledo lies gravely wounded. Three and a half minutes after the shooting, officers discover a handgun behind the fence, several feet from where Toledo was being treated. He was pronounced dead at the scene.Prosecutors initially said that the boy turned toward the officer and had a gun in his right hand. Immediately before the video was released, however, the Cook County State\\u2019s Attorney\\u2019s Office told WGN9 that that detail was inaccurate and that the attorney who provided the information \\u201Cfailed to fully inform himself before speaking in court.\\u201D Footage from a camera across a parking lot next to the alley shows Toledo's right arm moving behind the fence, making a tossing motion, before he turns back toward the officer with his hands up. His family's attorney stressed that, although video showed the 13-year-old appearing to toss something behind the fence, he was unarmed and with his hands in the air at the time he was shot. \\\"Adam, during his last seconds of life, did not have a gun in his hand,\\\" Weiss-Ortiz said. \\\"His hands were empty when he was shot in the chest at the hands of the officer. He did not have a gun in his hand, contrary to the reports made earlier today.\\\" The attorney added it was irrelevant whether Toledo had been carrying a gun. \\\"It could be a gun. I'm not going to deny that it could be a gun,\\\" she said. \\\"It is not relevant because he tossed the gun. If he had a gun, he tossed it. The officer said, 'Show me your hands.' He complied. He turned around.\\\" Weiss-Ortiz added, \\\"Whatever he had in his hand, there was something in his hand. He approaches the fence, lets it go, he turns around, and is shot.\\\" In the police records released Thursday, the officer who fatally shot Toledo was identified as 34-year-old Eric Stillman. According to a tactical incident report, which includes a set of boxes for officers to check, Stillman made claims about Toledo's behavior \\u2014 some of which do not appear to be substantiated by the body-worn video. The officer checked boxes that Toledo did not follow verbal commands, fled, posed an imminent threat, used force likely to cause death or great bodily harm, and that he was armed with a semiautomatic pistol. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Tim Grace, an attorney for Stillman, said that in his viewing, Toledo had the gun when he was confronted. Grace said officers had responded to shots fired at a passing car in the area and that the shell casings matched the gun recovered near Toledo. In the statement, Grace said Toledo's movement of turning around and raising his hands \\u2014 which occurred after Stillman yelled at him to show his hands \\u2014 could be interpreted as \\\"attempting to acquire a target\\\" as he turned to face the officer. \\u201CAt this point the officer was faced with a deadly force situation and all attempts to deescalate had failed,\\u201D Grace said, adding that nonlethal force was not a safe or effective option. \\u201CThe officer had no place to take cover or concealment, the gun was being [orientated] in his direction and he was left with no other option.\\u201D According to Weiss-Ortiz, the officer did not appear to have any previous discipline or \\\"incidents.\\\"The accountability office said that videos, recordings, and reports, which include body-worn camera footage, third-party videos, ShotSpotter gun detection recordings, and audio from 911 calls, have not been edited; however, some redactions were made to protect personal information. The officer who shot Toledo has been placed on administrative duties for 30 days, officials said. The police accountability office's investigation into the shooting is ongoing. The boy's family was allowed to view the footage Tuesday. Their attorney's office said in a statement that watching the videos \\\"was extremely difficult and heartbreaking.\\\" The statement said they would continue with their own investigation into the incident. Toledo's death has sparked outrage across the city, where young people in many communities are often exposed to gun violence. The seventh-grader is the youngest person in years to be killed by Chicago police, according to the Tribune. Ahead of the release, Mayor Lori Lightfoot described viewing the footage as \\\"excruciating.\\\" She also urged Chicagoans to respond peacefully and cautioned that the videos should not be viewed by children. \\\"Even as our understanding of this incident continues to evolve, this remains a complicated and nuanced story, and we all must proceed with deep empathy and calm,\\\" she said during a press conference Thursday. The mayor said Thursday that the city had failed Toledo as she called on the community to use his death as an opportunity to \\\"do better for our young people ... so that they can walk a life in their streets, in their neighborhoods, without fear, without feeling like they are prey wherever the violence comes from.\\\" Toledo had \\\"a big imagination and curiosity\\\" and loved animals, riding his bike, and zombies, his mother, Elizabeth Toledo, said in a statement. \\\"He even had this zombie apocalypse bag packed and ready to go,\\\" she said. \\\"May he rest in peace.\\\""},{"author":"Caroline Haskins","title":"Police Killing Of Daunte Wright Forces Another Reckoning In Minneapolis","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/carolinehaskins1\/minneapolis-community-response-police-killings","content":"BROOKLYN CENTER, Minnesota \\u2014 In 2015, it was Jamar Clark. A year later, Philando Castile. In 2020, George Floyd. And on Sunday, Daunte Wright. Over and over again, Minneapolis residents have had to relive the trauma of watching a police officer kill a Black man \\u2014 and they're exhausted. At a memorial event at the site of Wright\\u2019s death on Tuesday, one woman said she felt like she was experiencing déjà vu. \\u201CIt\\u2019s almost May, and we\\u2019re doing exactly what we were doing last May,\\u201D she said, referring to Floyd\\u2019s death in May 2020. Yet, in the face of immense hurt, residents also described trying to learn not just from last year but from decades of killings by police and centuries of anti-Black racism. They want to build on their activism, provide more aid for the community, and ultimately try to heal. \\u201CMy trust is not in this system no more; my trust is in you,\\u201D one man said at Wright\\u2019s memorial event. \\u201CI\\u2019ll be damned if we go another 400 years letting history repeat itself.\\u201DThe heart of the Minneapolis area is one with multiple nodes, from the George Floyd memorial site to community center parking lots and high schools, where dozens of people are distributing food to those in need. It also includes the people who are organizing for change and trying to heal. Leslie Redmond, president of the NAACP\\u2019s Minneapolis branch, has been trying to help the community through a healing-focused approach. In February, she formed the Community Healing Team, which brings together locals \\u2014 including a therapist, professor, comedian, rapper, and religious leaders. The group came together just before the trial began for Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who killed Floyd by pressing a knee into his neck for more than 9 minutes. Redmond said the goal was initially to help people process the trial, but the scope of the project changed after Wright's death. \\u201CNow we're having to help them survive another murder,\\u201D Redmond told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CAnd so we continue to throw salt on open wounds, but our work doesn't stop.\\u201D On Tuesday afternoon, the Community Healing Team came to Wright\\u2019s memorial site and led a crowd through prayers and breathing exercises. A microphone was passed around to those who wanted to say a few words. Redmond said it\\u2019s important to incorporate healing into activism, especially when planning for the long term. She said there are \\u201Cdeep wounds\\u201D in the community, which is still recovering from the police killings of Clark, Castile, and Floyd. \\u201CWe have to meet people where they are. We have to love people based on who they are, not who we want them to be,\\u201D Redmond said. \\u201CThat means loving everyone and loving them as they are and loving them as they come. And so, for me, representation is important.\\u201D People in and around the city have their own ways of channeling their grief. On Wednesday afternoon, a 27-year-old Minneapolis resident named José came to Wright\\u2019s memorial site and burned a bundle of sage. \\u201CI lit it around his little memorial and over where his spirit lay so he can feel like it\\u2019s OK to leave, because I know he\\u2019s trapped here and he\\u2019s scared,\\u201D he said. \\u201CSo I feel like that sage would be good just to tell him that it\\u2019s OK to go. It\\u2019s fine. We\\u2019ll take care of you here.\\u201DMeanwhile, other community efforts are unfolding in Minneapolis. Josh Fraser, principal of Brooklyn Center Community Schools, has spent the past several days working with dozens of school staffers, students, activists, and community members to gather food, toiletries, and household supplies for people in need to distribute at a community recreation center. \\u201CI got little left in the tank,\\u201D he said Wednesday morning. \\u201CMentally, I'm not at my best, but I'm just trying to move around physically because that's what I can give right now.\\u201D Shortly after Wright\\u2019s death, Fraser said, activists from Minneapolis gave advice on how to get in touch with businesses and groups that could provide food, refrigerators, tables, chairs, and anything else they might need to distribute supplies to people in need. He said that, unfortunately, the back-to-back tragedies of Floyd\\u2019s and Wright\\u2019s deaths have forged these connections between school leaders and activists. \\u201CThere [were] so many lessons to learn about how to interconnect people and connect the dots,\\u201D he said. \\u201CAnd they\\u2019ve just really helped us with that because that's not something we've done before [on] this large of a scale. This murder, this tragedy, has taught us how to be an even better community school. Unfortunately, this was something that did that for us.\\u201D Inside the high school, about a dozen students were gathered in the cafeteria painting protest signs. Some were meant for the streets, but most were for school grounds on Thursday, when students will come to protest in a safe environment. The events were planned by the school\\u2019s Youth Participatory Action Research club, which is focused on volunteer work and social justice issues. One of the members, 17-year-old Nayeli Williams, told BuzzFeed News that it\\u2019s been heartening to see support from the teachers and donations from the community. \\u201CWhen people are volunteering their time to make signs for a protest that they may not relate to directly because they\\u2019re not Black, they\\u2019re not young, it shows how selfless people can be in the community and how much they\\u2019re willing to help people that they care about,\\u201D she said. Sheridan Zeck, 17, and Kai Johnson, 16, noted that many students live at an apartment complex adjacent to the police station and the high school. Sheridan said it breaks her heart that, because of police, people have not felt safe in their homes. \\u201CPeople have had to evacuate,\\u201D she said. \\u201CThere\\u2019s families in there that are getting teargassed. They can\\u2019t sleep at night. They can\\u2019t breathe.\\u201D Kai said it was important to create a safe place for students to demonstrate since police have used tear gas on protesters in the city. Authorities again used pepper spray, rubber bullets, and other repellents against demonstrators who refused to disperse outside the heavily fortified police station Wednesday night. \\u201CThis was a really great way to be able to channel all our emotions about what\\u2019s happening into a project and to be able to support protesters and be able to protest ourselves,\\u201D Kai said.Redmond said it's important to have protests where people can yell and shout in addition to healing gatherings, which often have a different energy. For her, the site of Wright\\u2019s death was the appropriate place for the Community Healing Team to go. \\u201CSomebody asked me, \\u2018Why don't you do the healing gathering at the police station?\\u2019 And I didn't think that that was appropriate,\\u201D Redmond said. \\u201CThat was a place to protest, for people to yell, shout, and do whatever they needed to \\u2014 which could also be healing. I don't want to act like it can't be. But I think it is a very different energy when you have police presence, when you have military presence.\\u201D After passing around the microphone to several members of the Community Healing Team at the Wright memorial site, Redmond encouraged attendees to share what was on their mind. One 26-year-old man started talking about his experiences with racial profiling and harassment in public spaces by his own neighbors. As he spoke, he became deeply upset. At one point, Redmond interrupted and embraced him. After a few moments, the man started to sob. Two other people joined the embrace. \\u201CYou can hear it in his voice \\u2014 he\\u2019s hurting,\\u201D said one member of the healing team after taking the microphone. \\u201CHe loves this city. He loves this community.\\u201DAt another point, a man took the microphone and led the crowd through a calming breathing exercise. As he concluded, the sun peeked through the overcast sky, and a soft glow shone over the crowd. The man smiled as he noticed. \\u201CThank you, universe,\\u201D he said. \\u201CThank yourselves.\\u201D"},{"author":"Stephanie K.

He was funny and had big dreams for his future. He loved his family and his baby boy. But the 20-year-old was shot to death by police Sunday afternoon during a traffic stop in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, becoming the latest Black man to be killed during an encounter with law enforcement. He died just a few miles away from where George Floyd was killed last summer. Wright\\u2019s killing sparked a new wave of protests at the same time that Derek Chauvin, the cop who killed Floyd, is being tried for murder. \\u201CThis time last year, almost a year ago, [the Floyd family] were facing the unimaginable. They were facing the agony of losing a family member to police excessive force,\\\" civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing both the Floyd and Wright families, said at a press conference Tuesday. \\\"And it is unbelievable \\u2014 it is just something I could not fathom \\u2014 that in Minneapolis, Minnesota, a suburb 10 miles from where the Chauvin trial regarding George Floyd was taking place, that a police officer would shoot and kill another unarmed Black man.\\\" In press conferences and media appearances, Wright\\u2019s family have sought to paint a fuller picture of the man beyond the headlines of his death. Mother Katie Wright told Good Morning America that Wright was a son, grandson, sibling, and uncle. He was also a basketball fanatic, she said, who will now never get to play ball with his own infant son. \\\"My son was an amazing, loving kid,\\\" Katie said. \\\"He had a big heart.\\u201D On an old Facebook profile page, Wright often posted about gearing up for basketball games. In 2014, when he was just 13, he wrote confidently that he was \\u201Cbout to try to drop 20 points\\\" at a game. After his death, a Facebook page supporting local youth sports shared an undated photo of Wright and his teammates, reminiscing about the time he spent playing basketball. \\\"Rest in peace to one of Heights very own,\\\" the post read. \\\"We shared many hours in the gym with you Daunte Wright.\\\"A sister of one of Wright's close friends, who asked not to be identified, told BuzzFeed News Wright was a big Chicago Bulls fan. Aside from basketball, he loved to play video games and hang out with his friends, she said, describing Wright as \\u201Cthe life of the party.\\u201D \\u201CHe was just a really good friend,\\u201D she said. \\u201CWe considered him to be our brother.\\u201D The woman said Wright was someone friends could always count on and that she felt she could open up to him about anything. She recalled one summer night a couple of years ago when he was at their house for a bonfire and went to sit with her because he could tell she had been crying. \\u201CI was kind of going through a breakup,\\u201D she said. \\u201CHe came and put his arm around me and let me know that I deserve so much more and that I was going to get it. And I shouldn't settle for less.\\u201D\\u2028 She said Wright wanted to get a degree and \\u201Cprove to himself that he could make it out of Brooklyn Park, Minneapolis.\\u201D \\u201CHe was just trying to turn his life around,\\u201D she said.Jonathan Mason, who mentored Wright when he was a student at Edison High School, recalled at a vigil how he dreamed of owning a business one day. \\\"He was someone who had a future,\\\" Mason said. \\\"Daunte was funny, he was lively. He was the center of attention. He had a very, very welcoming personality. He would joke with you back and forth.\\\" Aly Phay, 21, who met Wright through friends a few years ago, told BuzzFeed News Wright wanted to become \\\"rich and famous\\\" and was focused on making money and taking care of his son. She described him as a \\\"one-of-a-kind\\\" friend and someone who would always check up on her. Wright's cousin, Mario Greer, said the 4th of July was their favorite holiday to spend together. They loved to shoot Roman candles at each other in the summer heat. \\\"We're not gonna be able to do that no more,\\\" Greer said. Friends and family remembered Wright's smile as one that, as his mom put it, would \\\"light up the room it was so big and bright.\\\" \\u201CThat\\u2019s what I remember most about him,\\\" Phay said. \\\"Even through hard times he always had a smile on his face! I still remember his laugh in my head.\\u201D His brother Dallas Bryant described him at a vigil as an average 20-year-old who loved to drive around and listen to music. But, Bryant said, Wright stood out for his fierce loyalty and compassion. \\\"He is the kid to give you the shirt off of his back,\\u201D Bryant said. \\u201CHe is the most loyal person to anybody.\\\"Law enforcement officials have said officers pulled Wright over because of an expired registration tag on his car. When they ran his name through their system, they found he had a warrant out for his arrest because of a missed virtual court appearance for misdemeanor charges of carrying a handgun without a permit and running from police last June. While officers attempted to arrest him, Wright tried to break free and get back in his car. Body camera footage shows the officer who killed Wright, Kim Potter, warned she would tase him, but then she fatally shot him. Police have said the officer appeared to mistake her handgun for a Taser. Both she and the city\\u2019s chief of police have since resigned. Potter is now facing a second-degree manslaughter charge. Katie Wright has said her son was scared of the police. She told reporters that after he was pulled over he called her because the officers were asking about the car's insurance. Wright told her he had been pulled over because he had air fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror. (In some states, including Minnesota, it's illegal to dangle any object from a rearview mirror.) \\\"I said, \\u2018OK, when the police officer comes back to the window, put him on the phone and I can give him all our insurance information,\\u2019\\\" she said. A moment later, Katie said she heard the police officer return and ask Daunte to get out of the car. \\\"He said, \\u2018Am I in trouble?\\u2019 [The officer] said, \\u2018We\\u2019ll explain all that when you step out of the car,'\\\" Katie recalled. They asked her son to put the phone down, and then she heard some scuffling before the officer asked Daunte and a female passenger who was in the car to hang up. When Katie called back, the female passenger answered the phone and told her the police had shot her son.Crump, the attorney, said Wright did not pose a threat to the police and was trying to flee because he was scared. \\\"Was it the best decision? No, but young people don\\u2019t always make the best decisions,\\u201D he said. During the press conference Tuesday, the Wright family was joined by relatives of Floyd and Emmett Till, the 14-year-old who was abducted, beaten, shot, and killed in 1955 while visiting relatives in Mississippi. Their presence demonstrated the pain Black people have endured for generations. \\\"Can you blame Daunte for being terrified, as a Black man in the custody of police? When you just watched, here in Minneapolis, George Floyd murdered at the hands of the very same police, and who was unarmed?\\\" said Brandon Williams, Floyd's nephew. \\\"At some point, we need change. At some point, we need better policing. At some point, we need officers to be held accountable, charged, and convicted.\\\""},{"author":"Salvador Hernandez","title":"Daunte Wright: Cop Kim Potter Charged With Manslaughter","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/salvadorhernandez\/daunte-wright-cop-kim-potter-charged","content":"Kim Potter, the former Minnesota police officer who fatally shot Daunte Wright during a traffic stop on Sunday, is being charged with manslaughter, authorities announced Wednesday. Washington County Attorney Pete Orput's office announced she would be charged with second-degree manslaughter in connection with the death, which police have said was accidental. Potter was arrested Wednesday morning by agents at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) in St. Paul. She was booked into the Hennepin County jail. She was released five hours later after posting a $100,000 bond, according to jail records. \\\"Certain occupations carry an immense responsibility and none more so than a sworn police officer,\\\" Washington County Assistant Criminal Division Chief Imran Ali said in a statement. \\\"We will vigorously prosecute this case and intend to prove that Officer Potter abrogated her responsibility to protect the public when she used her firearm rather than her taser. Her action caused the unlawful killing of Mr. Wright and she must be held accountable.\\\" In their statement, the Washington County Attorney's office noted Potter's handgun was holstered on the right side of her duty belt, while her Taser is located on the left said. Potter's attorney, Earl Gray, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Wright's killing in Brooklyn Center set off a wave of protests in the town, as well as headlines around the country, amid continued outrage over the treatment of Black people by police. Potter, a 26-year veteran of the Brooklyn Center Police Department, resigned Tuesday. She had been placed on administrative leave after fatally shooting the 20-year-old Black man during a traffic stop on April 11, but instead submitted her letter of resignation two days later. Her departure came a day after police released body camera footage that showed Potter yelling \\u201CTaser! Taser! Taser!\\u201D even though she was holding a firearm. The video showed Wright trying to get away from police and jumping back into his car before he was shot by Potter. Potter could then be heard telling her fellow officers, \\u201COh shit, I just shot him.\\u201D Then\\u2013Brooklyn Center police chief Tim Gannon on Monday called the shooting \\u201Caccidental,\\u201D saying Potter appeared to think she was using her Taser when she fired her handgun. Gannon also resigned from his position the following day, after two consecutive nights of protests in the city. Attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Wright's family, applauded the decision to charge Potter, but brushed aside comments from the former police chief calling the shooting accidental. \\\"This was an intentional, deliberate, and unlawful use of force,\\\" Crump said in a statement. \\\"A 26-year veteran of the force knows the difference between a taser and a firearm. Kim Potter executed Daunte for what amounts to no more than a minor traffic infraction and a misdemeanor warrant.\\\" Crump, who has represented the families in other high-profile cases of Black men and women killed by police officers, compared the killing to that of George Floyd, Eric Garner, and Breonna Taylor, whose deaths have prompted protests across the country and calls for police reforms and accountability. \\\"Kim Potter saw [Daunte Wright] as expendable,\\\" Crump wrote. \\\"It's past time for meaningful change in our country.\\\" Wright had been pulled over because of expired tags on his car, and officers attempted to take him into custody when they found he had a warrant for his arrest for missing a Zoom court appearance for misdemeanor charges of carrying a handgun without a permit and running from police. In her resignation letter, Potter wrote that she \\u201Cloved every minute of being a police officer and serving this community,\\u201D but said that she believed \\u201Cit is in the best interest of the community, and my fellow officers if I resign immediately.\\u201D Potter had worked in the department for over 25 years and was, at the time, president of the department\\u2019s police officers union, according to KSTP. As president of the union, Potter would have led officers in labor negotiations with the city, as well as represented and defended officers during disciplinary actions and after police shootings. Wright\\u2019s death at the hands of police comes while the country, and especially the Minneapolis community, is still reeling from the death of George Floyd, another Black man killed during an encounter with police. While large crowds gathered outside the Brooklyn Center Police Department this week, the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with killing Floyd, has been taking place just a few miles south in Minneapolis."},{"author":"Stephanie McNeal","title":"Colton Underwood Came Out As Gay. He's Also Been Accused Of Harassing An Ex.","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/stephaniemcneal\/colton-underwood-stalking-allegations-gma","content":"On Wednesday, former Bachelor star Colton Underwood came out as gay in an exclusive interview with Good Morning America. Speaking to Robin Roberts, Underwood explained it had taken him years to come to terms with the fact he is gay, even going so far as to appear on one of the most heteronormative shows on television while struggling with his sexuality. \\\"I've ran from myself for a long time. I've hated myself for a long time,\\\" Underwood said. Underwood\\u2019s years of turmoil and struggle were clear on his face during the interview, in which he was visibly emotional and nervous. He explains his childhood growing up as part of the Catholic Church made him feel being gay was a sin, and that anti-gay slurs he heard during his sports career (he played football at Illinois State University and briefly in the NFL) only added to the shame he felt. He discussed deeply personal issues, alluding to suicidal thoughts and self-hatred. Underwood, 29, said that when he was chosen as the Bachelor in 2018, he thanked God for \\u201Cmaking me straight,\\u201D saying he viewed his selection as a sign that he could have the straight relationship he thought he needed. He repeatedly discussed his virginity during his season, leading him to be called the \\u201Cvirgin Bachelor.\\u201D Underwood savvily embraced that label, writing a cheekily titled autobiography, The First Time, which came out in March 2020. All this led to fame for Underwood, but ultimately, he realized he had been running from his true self all along. The interview became an instant media sensation, and Underwood received a warm embrace from thousands of people online. Longtime host of the franchise Chris Harrison (currently on hiatus) returned from a self-imposed Instagram exile to effuse about how proud he was of Underwood. Andy Cohen, Dan Levy, JoJo Siwa, and several other gay celebrities congratulated Underwood online. A video from his season featuring comedian Billy Eichner, who had told Underwood on the show that maybe he could be the \\u201Cfirst gay Bachelor,\\u201D went viral. Soon, it became clear that Underwood\\u2019s star is only going to continue to rise. Multiple media outlets reported on Wednesday that Netflix is filming an unscripted series with Underwood about his new life as an out gay man, featuring several prominent gay celebrities, including Olympian Gus Kenworthy. There is even talk, according to TMZ, of bringing Underwood back as the Bachelor, this time with a group of male suitors. I am genuinely happy for Underwood and the fact that he is able to live his life in a true and free way. I have no doubt he has struggled, and I am glad he is in a better place. However, I am disturbed by the extent to which the media and Underwood himself are completely sweeping a huge issue under the rug: Underwood\\u2019s alleged stalking and harassment of his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Randolph, which Underwood has neither publicly confirmed nor denied. Since the allegations first emerged last fall, Underwood, through the press, has successfully been able to write his own narrative of the events, a strategy that has left his reputation virtually intact. Randolph hasn\\u2019t had the same kind of success shaping the narrative of what happened.Last September, Randolph, the winner of Underwood\\u2019s Bachelor season, filed a temporary restraining order against him, saying he had been stalking and harassing her after their May breakup. According to court records, Randolph said Underwood sent unsettling text messages to her, her friends, and her family; repeatedly called her; and placed a tracking device on her vehicle to view her whereabouts. According to Randolph, Underwood also began stalking her apartment and her parents\\u2019 home in Huntington Beach, California, after they split, harassing her about male friends visiting her, and sending her text messages like, \\u201CI am going to keep you accountable.\\u201D The incidents culminated in Underwood allegedly sending Randolph threatening messages from an anonymous number and then saying he had also been under attack. Court records state that Randolph then found the tracker on her car and filed the temporary restraining order and police report. The court granted the temporary restraining order but didn\\u2019t rule on the allegations. Many fans of the show, especially many women who had experienced intimate partner violence, were dismayed and outraged by the news. Underwood never publicly commented on the restraining order, but tabloids gave Underwood plenty of chances to defend himself. Us Weekly reported Underwood had been \\u201Ccompletely blindsided\\u201D by her allegations, with a source painting him as the victim. \\u201CColton was absolutely in love with Cassie. It was clear she did not feel the same way about him, which of course, upset him. It was really hard for him,\\u201D the source told Us Weekly. \\u201CShe literally broke up with him as soon as he was healthy enough to move out [from COVID-19].\\u201D The source also told the magazine that Randolph had been \\u201Cvery nervous about losing her fanbase\\u201D after the split and that Randolph had been seeing her ex \\u201Cshortly after\\u201D the breakup with Underwood. Randolph did not respond to the Us Weekly report. After news of the restraining order and the tabloid defenses of Underwood broke, her Instagram comments were flooded with hate. People accused Randolph of \\u201Cplaying\\u201D Underwood, being \\u201Cmanipulative,\\u201D and \\u201Cruining Colton\\u2019s life.\\u201D Underwood was able to continue taking control of the narrative of the split. In November, People reported that Randolph had dropped the restraining order after the former couple were able to settle the matter privately. Randolph didn\\u2019t speak publicly, but Underwood did. \\\"Today Cassie asked the court to dismiss the temporary restraining order against me. The two of us were able to reach a private agreement to address any of Cassie\\u2019s concerns,\\\" he told the magazine. \\\"I do not believe Cassie did anything wrong in filing for the restraining orders and also believe she acted in good faith. I appreciate everyone\\u2019s respect for privacy regarding this matter.\\\" Meanwhile, Randolph stayed mostly silent, and a source told Us Weekly that she just wanted the public back-and-forth to end. \\u201CCassie just wants to move forward in life with stuff she has going on like settling into her new place. She definitely doesn\\u2019t want to bring up her past again,\\u201D the insider told Us Weekly. \\u201CIt\\u2019s exhausting for her to deal with his \\u2018version\\u2019 of things, so she\\u2019s chosen to not make any remarks or give into it anymore.\\u201D Still, Underwood continued to bring the relationship into the public eye. In January, he released a new chapter of his memoir, in which he promised new details on his split from Randolph. He again insists Randolph blindsided him with the breakup, writing that she was \\u201Cstruggling to find the right words and reasons that made sense. None did\\u2014 at least not to me.\\u201D Given everything that has happened, it is unfathomable that, amid all the coverage of Underwood\\u2019s coming out, no one is asking Underwood to fully account for the allegations against him and reflect on how Randolph has been vilified online by his defenders. On GMA, Roberts did \\u2014 briefly \\u2014 address the temporary restraining order in a voiceover, but only asked Underwood if he had anything to say to Randolph. \\\"I would like to say sorry for how things ended. I messed up,\\\" he said. \\\"I made a lot of bad choices.\\\" But his apology feels rather hollow. After all, there is a big difference between making a \\u201Cbad choice\\u201D and allegedly harassing and stalking someone. While Roberts, and those participating in the glowing news coverage of Underwood\\u2019s interview, were unwilling to ask Underwood to confront the allegations head-on, there is one group that hasn\\u2019t forgotten: the fans. Several went on social media to point out that Underwood has never truly owned up to his alleged actions, or really, taken accountability for perpetuating a narrative that led to online harassment of Randolph by his supporters.Many criticized the opportunities being heaped on him, saying it seemed clear that Underwood was attempting to rehab his image. \\u201CColton coming out and then announcing a Netflix special in what seems to be an attempt to bury the fact that he stalked and harassed his ex-girlfriend, going as far to put a tracker on her car, is just *chef\\u2019s kiss* we love that. Good job, @netflix,\\u201D wrote one woman on Twitter. That\\u2019s the rub. Underwood is totally within his rights to speak his truth, and even to benefit in his career from his new status as the first gay lead of the Bachelor franchise. But for him to do so without acknowledging the real hurt and pain he caused, for both Randolph and the fans, feels wrong. It\\u2019s fine to continue to stay in the public eye and share your truth after making big mistakes, but this feels more like sweeping serious allegations under the rug than an atonement. As for Randolph, she continues to remain silent about Underwood on social media. \\u201CShe was not made aware in advance that he was going to be on GMA doing a tell-all,\\u201D an insider told Us Weekly. \\u201CTo be honest, she hasn\\u2019t really had time to navigate how she feels about it yet.\\u201D●"},{"author":"Dan Vergano","title":"A West Virginia Law May Drive Needle Exchanges Underground","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/danvergano\/hiv-needle-law-west-virginia","content":"West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice on Thursday signed a law restricting needle exchanges in the state, likely shuttering or driving many underground. The move came despite a worsening HIV outbreak, a crisis that needle exchanges have repeatedly been shown to help stop. In February, a CDC official told a Charleston, West Virginia, city council committee that the country\\u2019s \\u201Cmost concerning\\u201D HIV outbreak was occurring among people using injection drugs there. Despite needle exchanges helping limit past outbreaks in Indiana and West Virginia, the state will now regulate the programs for the first time. It's a move that supporters, such as Justice, say is based on \\u201Cgood science,\\u201D but which public health experts say will hobble the programs, worsening the HIV outbreak and leading to more people dying from drug overdoses. \\u201CYou\\u2019re actually talking about human beings here. This will kill them or make them sick,\\u201D Laura Jones at Milan Puskar Health Right in Morgantown, West Virginia, told BuzzFeed News. Programs in one of the three counties Jones\\u2019 programs operate in will likely be shut down by the law\\u2019s requirements that county politicians and city officials approve of them. \\u201CThis is just going to drive some programs underground,\\u201D she said.The basic idea behind needle exchanges \\u2014 shown to be effective in two decades of public health research and endorsed by the Trump administration \\u2014 is to give new needles to people using illegal drugs so they don\\u2019t share used ones and spread disease, while also offering them healthcare and an entry point into treatment. There are more than a dozen needle exchange programs in West Virginia, already hit hard by the nationwide epidemic of illicit opioid drug use and overdoses. The HIV outbreak in Charleston followed the city ending its own needle exchange program in 2018 over complaints about needle litter. Similarly, nearby Cabell County limited its program that year to people willing to use state identification, which cost it half of its participants and sparked an HIV outbreak there. \\u201CWhen you have an HIV outbreak, you want to get needles to as many people as possible. This law will instead shut down almost every program in West Virginia,\\u201D said West Virginia University public health expert Robin Pollini. Local politicians are unlikely to OK the programs, she said. Additionally, the restrictions contradict CDC guidelines for needle exchanges, making it likely that other health conditions, like hepatitis and endocarditis, will increase along with drug overdoses since the programs are a leading provider of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone in the state. \\u201CThis will be the strictest needle exchange law in the country, and I worry it will be a model for other states trying to regulate them out of existence,\\u201D said Pollini. Supporters of the new law, such as lead sponsor state Sen. Eric Tarr, have said it is aimed at eliminating needle litter and programs that don\\u2019t automatically enroll drug users into recovery programs. Among other restrictions, the law would require needle exchanges to label syringes (linking the needle to a user) and mandate state licensing to operate. Against CDC recommendations, exchanges would strive for matching the number of needles handed out with the number of returns, could only give needles to people with state-issued identification (discouraging people experiencing homelessness or people using illicit drugs who fear being arrested from participating), and would prevent people from picking up needles for other participants, which can be helpful in a rural state with limited public transportation.The law seems particularly aimed at needle exchanges not connected to local health departments, like Charleston\\u2019s Solutions Oriented Addiction Response (SOAR) nonprofit. Charleston\\u2019s police department investigated SOAR in undercover operations before concluding in January it wasn\\u2019t breaking any law against operating without a license, because the state doesn\\u2019t offer licenses. The group helped uncover the HIV outbreak in Charleston last fall by offering testing to participants, along with food and medical care. In late March, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia demanded an inquiry into the CDC\\u2019s finding of an HIV outbreak in Kanawha County, where Charleston is located. Instead of asking for help from the federal health agency as would normally happen in such an outbreak, Kanawha County commissioners questioned the CDC\\u2019s evidence for an HIV outbreak, based on medical test results reported to the state health department. The city has postponed voting on its own needle exchange ordinance until April 19, while it waits for the state licensing law to go through. \\u201CThere's no doubt in my mind, or any freshman public health analysis, that this bill is an HIV-spreader,\\u201D said SOAR coleader Joe Solomon in an email. \\u201CWe're not going to let more of our people die, or get HIV, if we can help it.\\u201D \\u201CImagine if giving out masks were illegal during COVID-19: would you still make sure your family and loved ones were protected?\\u201D asked Solomon. \\u201COf course you would.\\u201D"},{"author":"Paul McLeod","title":"NRA Bankruptcy Looms Over Gun Control In Congress","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/paulmcleod\/gun-control-nra-bankruptcy-congress","content":"WASHINGTON \\u2014 Time after time, Democrats have tried to pass reforms to restrict access to firearms. Time after time, the National Rifle Association has led successful campaigns to block every bill. Now the NRA has imploded, and Democrats see an opening after a wave of mass shootings to start the year. Senate Republicans, though, see that as wishful thinking \\u2014 in interviews this week, senators repeatedly said they don\\u2019t need an active NRA to tell them where they stand on guns. The NRA\\u2019s decades of work are already baked in. New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing to dissolve the NRA, alleging senior leadership siphoned tens of millions of dollars to fund their lavish lifestyles. In response, the NRA is attempting to declare bankruptcy and reincorporate in Texas. The association\\u2019s spending is restricted and requires court approval. Democrats were already planning to try to extend background checks for firearm sales this year. The NRA being off the board is causing even more optimism that they can reach some bipartisan deal that can get through Congress. \\u201CTheir power is what stopped background checks from passing in 2013. It can\\u2019t not matter that they are significantly less able to run an effective political operation,\\u201D Sen. Chris Murphy told BuzzFeed News this week. Last year set a record with almost 20,000 people in America dying from gun violence; an additional 24,000 people killed themselves using a gun. And 2021 has already seen a wave of mass shootings. Eight people were killed and five more wounded at a mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis Thursday, at least the seventh mass shooting in the past month. Democrats seem to be working toward a plan similar to the one that came a few votes shy of passing in 2013, though the details are fluid. That bill would have expanded background check requirements to guns sold online and at gun shows, while exempting most private sales between friends and family. Things have changed since that bill failed. The NRA was broadly popular at the time and even several Democrats sought its political endorsement. Four Democratic senators opposed the background checks bill. By 2018, after the school shooting in Parkland, the NRA\\u2019s polling was underwater \\u2014 more people had an unfavorable view of the association than a favorable one \\u2014 and Democrats were running midterm ads boasting about their F ratings on NRA report cards. \\u201CI think the gun lobby has lost its viselike grip on Congress,\\u201D said Sen. Richard Blumenthal this week. \\u201CNow whether the political dynamic changes radically this session or if it takes another session to do it remains to be seen.\\u201D The NRA successfully killed the 2013 bill by arguing background checks were ineffective in stopping crime and an infringement on Second Amendment rights. Those views are by now dogma in most of the Republican Party. Most Republicans in Congress frame any gun control measures \\u2014 even modest and broadly popular changes such as expanding existing background check laws to gun show sales \\u2014 as undermining the Second Amendment. Despite the wave of recent mass shootings, Senate Republicans are showing no signs of budging from their opposition to new gun control laws. It\\u2019s not clear that there needs to be an NRA to deliver its message anymore. Republicans who talked to BuzzFeed News this week laughed off the idea that the collapse of the NRA will have any impact on a bill\\u2019s chances. \\u201CI think really people who run for office have made their decision on where they are on the Second Amendment, regardless of the different lobbying groups,\\u201D said Sen. Rand Paul. Sen. Ted Cruz said there\\u2019s no doubt the NRA\\u2019s financial troubles \\u2014 which he described as political persecution by a Democratic attorney general \\u2014 will limit its ability to champion its message. But he said that won\\u2019t matter because Republicans are already united. \\u201CI fully expect that Republicans will continue to defend the Second Amendment and I fully expect that virtually every Democrat will work tirelessly to undermine the Second Amendment,\\u201D said Cruz. With the Senate split 50\\u201350, Democrats would need to win over 10 Republicans on any gun control measure to override a filibuster. Expanding background checks enjoys broad bipartisan support outside of Congress and polls show even a majority of Republicans are in favor. But this has been true for years, and no bill has come close to passing since 2013. One thing that does seem certain is that gun control, in one form or another, will get a Senate vote this year. This week Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer listed gun safety as a \\u201Ckey priority\\u201D that he intends to bring to the Senate floor, though he did not give a timeline. While the NRA is sidelined, Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control group backed by Michael Bloomberg, is shelling out for a seven-figure ad campaign to promote reforms. Murphy, one of the Democratic point people in gun control talks, is not providing much information about his conversations with Republican lawmakers. His language has been guarded, saying this week it \\u201Cisn\\u2019t out of the realm of possibility\\u201D that they can get enough votes to overcome a filibuster. While leaving the Senate on Wednesday, Republican Sen. Joni Ernst told BuzzFeed News that gun control is an issue where politicians already know where they stand and where their supporters stand. Asked if she would be open to the push to expand background checks, Ernst said she had not yet talked to Murphy, but would be happy to hear him out. Seconds later, she ran into him as he also headed to his office. \\u201CGood timing!\\u201D she said, beginning a conversation as they walked out of earshot."},{"author":"Ken Bensinger","title":"Oath Keeper Jon Schaffer Pleads Guilty In Capitol Riot","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/kenbensinger\/jon-schaffer-oath-keepers-pleads-guilty-capitol-riot","content":"Federal prosecutors have secured a guilty plea from a man charged with participating in the Capitol riots as a member of the Oath Keepers, marking the first conviction in the sprawling investigation into the events of Jan. 6 as well as the first known cooperator in the case. Jon Schaffer, 52, of Fort Wayne, Indiana, appeared before a federal judge in Washington, DC, on Friday morning. He pleaded guilty to obstructing an official proceeding and entering a restricted building with a deadly or dangerous weapon, both of which are felonies. Schaffer was captured on surveillance video inside the Capitol carrying what prosecutors identified as \\u201Cbear spray,\\u201D which they said he sprayed at Capitol Police officers. \\u201CHe is the first individual to step forward in this historic investigation and take responsibility for his role in the Capitol riot,\\u201D said his attorney Andrew Marcantel in court. As part of his plea, Schaffer, who is best known as the lead guitarist and founding member of the heavy metal band Iced Earth, has agreed to provide information to investigators and potentially testify on behalf of the government at trial. The plea agreement itself has not yet been made public. To date, more than 400 people have been charged in the ongoing probe, which the Department of Justice has said is among the largest in its history. In recent days, prosecutors have stated that they are hoping to forge additional plea deals with other defendants in the case. BuzzFeed News first reported that the Justice Department was in \\\"advanced plea negotiations\\\" with Schaffer earlier this month after a sealed document was inadvertently posted online briefly. Under federal sentencing guidelines, Schaffer could face a prison term of between 41 and 51 months for his crimes, but he could face significantly less time in exchange for his help as a cooperating witness. Judge Amit Mehta noted in court Friday that Schaffer had no prior criminal convictions on his record. Schaffer was arrested and initially charged with six crimes on Jan. 17 after the FBI found he had entered the US Capitol carrying bear spray and \\u201Cengaging in verbal altercations with Capitol Police officers.\\u201D At the time, he was wearing a baseball cap identifying him as a lifetime member of the Oath Keepers, an armed extremist group.In a separate case before the same judge, a dozen alleged members of the Oath Keepers are facing conspiracy charges for their role in what prosecutors claim was a planned and coordinated attempt to interfere with certification of the Electoral College. That prosecution is the largest of any to come out of the Capitol riots to date and, because of the charges, perhaps the most serious. Prosecutors have claimed that the members of the alleged conspiracy prepared for weeks if not months, stashed weapons in a hotel outside Washington, DC, provided security details to Roger Stone and others, forced their way into the Capitol building, and then discussed plans to continue an armed resistance against the US government after the inauguration of President Joe Biden. No evidence has been shown to date directly linking Schaffer to that planning, and he does not appear to have been part of the \\u201Cstack\\u201D formation of members of the Oath Keepers who prosecutors say pushed into the Capitol building. But his apparent association with the Oath Keepers, which was founded in 2009 and has claimed it has tens of thousands of members around the country, could be helpful to investigators in a number of ways. The Justice Department, in a press release, identified Schaffer as a \\u201Clifetime founding member of the Oath Keepers,\\u201D and noted that he had acknowledged that status in his guilty plea. However, Schaffer is not an actual founder of the organization, and it would appear that his lifetime membership status is simply a matter of his having paid for the privilege. The national organization, which sells lifetime memberships for $1,200, has not commented on Schaffer\\u2019s affiliation with the group. A week after his arrest, however, the Indiana Oath Keepers released a statement disavowing Schafer and saying he was not a member. In filings and in statements in court, prosecutors have indicated that they may charge numerous additional individuals associated with the Oath Keepers for their role in the events of Jan. 6. In addition, the Justice Department has revealed that it has been closely watching Oath Keepers actual founder, Stewart Rhodes. In filings and statements in court, prosecutors have indicated that they may charge numerous additional individuals associated with the Oath Keepers for their role in the events of Jan. 6. In addition, the Justice Department has revealed that it has been closely watching Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes. Rhodes has not been charged in the case, but text messages, phone records, and other evidence presented by prosecutors show that he was deeply involved in planning for the day, that he was in direct contact with Oath Keepers just prior to them entering the building, and that he met with them on the Capitol grounds after they had left. In a court filing earlier this week, prosecutors revealed that Rhodes was in direct contact with some of the now-indicted Oath Keepers as recently as early last month. At an anti-immigration rally in Texas last month, Rhodes suggested he was preparing to be arrested at any moment. Schaffer has been in jail since his arrest. In that time, he has seen both his bands get dropped by their labels, and at least two of his bandmates have quit. Following his guilty plea, he was granted conditional release. His attorney asked that he be allowed to travel to Florida and Arizona to continue to record music. The request was granted."},{"author":"Aviva Stahl","title":"Bills Targeting Trans Kids Healthcare Have Flawed Science","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/avivastahl\/transgender-trans-kids-healthcare-science","content":"In late March, before Arkansas lawmakers officially blocked minors from obtaining gender-affirming medical care, Willow Breshears, an 18-year-old trans woman in Little Rock, spoke of her fears to a local news outlet: \\u201CThe people who are legislating [against] these trans kids have no grasp of what a trans experience is.\\u201D Most in the medical community would agree with her. As similar bills are introduced and debated across the country, transgender children and their families have gone public to explain that treatments like puberty-blocking hormones and gender-affirming hormone therapy are medically necessary and potentially lifesaving. But they\\u2019re not the only ones speaking out. Every major medical association in the United States \\u2014 including the American Medical Association, the Endocrine Society, the Pediatric Endocrine Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry \\u2014 has issued statements supporting gender-affirming care for youth that have met specific diagnostic criteria (the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, for example, says adolescents are only eligible for puberty blockers if they\\u2019ve demonstrated \\u201Ca long-lasting and intense pattern of gender nonconformity or gender dysphoria,\\u201D have the ability to understand the benefits and risks of the medication, and have parental consent). Many of the same groups have issued explicit statements opposing the bills or testified against them in state hearings. Yet while opposition in the medical field has been overwhelming, it has not been unanimous. A small number of highly controversial doctors and researchers have been pushing these anti-trans bills. Representing organizations with seemingly professional names like the American College of Pediatricians or the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine, they have effectively accomplished for gender dysphoria what anti-vaxxer medical professionals have sought to do for their cause: give credence to the notion that no scientific or medical consensus exists regarding the relative safety and efficacy of a given treatment, despite the clear and growing evidence to the contrary. \\u201CThe policy debates about banning gender-affirming medical care have been really hard to watch because every major medical organization is opposed to these bills,\\u201D said Jack Turban, a fellow in child and adolescent psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine who focuses on transgender youth. With no support from the mainstream medical community, conservative legislators have gone and found \\u201Cthis handful of people who have \\u2018MD\\u2019 after their name\\u201D but lack the research, experience, and evidence to back their claims, he said. \\u201CProponents of these bills claim that they are advocating in the interests of transgender children, which is actually ludicrous,\\u201D said Hannah Willard, the vice president of government affairs at Freedom for All Americans, a bipartisan group pushing for protections against LGTBQ discrimination nationwide. \\u201CThese fringe extremists are trying to push a narrative that transgender people need saving from the medical experts.\\u201DThe last few years have brought an onslaught of anti-trans legislation; most recently, these proposed laws are attempting to ban trans children from playing in sports leagues that match their gender identity. One wave of legislation, which peaked in 2017 and 2018, aimed to limit trans kids\\u2019 ability to use the bathroom or locker room that corresponds to their gender identity. But last year, perhaps prompted by sensationalist and inaccurate right-wing media coverage of a Texas custody case involving parents who disagreed over treatments for their trans child, a new set of bills began appearing in legislatures across the country aimed at prohibiting or even criminalizing giving puberty blockers and gender-affirming hormones to minors. In the 2019\\u20132020 legislative year, at least 15 states introduced bills prohibiting healthcare for trans youth. This year, at least 13 states have introduced similar bills. Arkansas is the first state to ban gender-affirming healthcare. On Monday, a committee in the Texas Senate heard testimony on a bill that would make it a felony for parents to provide their children with puberty blockers, hormones, or other gender-affirming care. At least on the surface, proponents of these bills have framed their need in medical terms. The Arkansas bill, for example, makes a host of pseudoscientific claims: that the majority of gender-nonconforming children \\u201Ccome to identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood,\\u201D that puberty blockers are being prescribed \\u201Cdespite the lack of any long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs,\\u201D and that \\u201Cthe risks of gender transition procedures far outweigh any benefit.\\u201D But these assertions are either misleading or verifiably false, according to experts in the field. Studies have consistently shown that providing gender-affirming care to gender-diverse children \\u2014 which includes allowing them to socially transition and access puberty blockers and gender-affirming hormones \\u2014 is correlated with lower rates of suicide and mental illness. Studies have also shown that children who aren\\u2019t supported, such as those who undergo therapy with the aim of eliminating their trans identity, have worse health outcomes and are more likely to have thoughts of suicide. Proponents of the anti-trans healthcare bills often distort the findings of these studies, experts told BuzzFeed News. Kristina Olson, a professor of psychology at Princeton University who in 2018 received a MacArthur grant to study the social and cognitive development of trans and gender-nonconforming youth, said the claim that children eventually identify with their birth gender as they enter adulthood is a misinterpretation of an outdated study, as other scientists have explained elsewhere. More recently, critics of gender-affirming care have promoted a widely criticized and methodologically flawed study that appeared to indicate that gender dysphoria was being spread through social circles. In reality, this misconception was from parents of gender-nonconforming children. Heron Greenesmith, a senior analyst at Political Research Associates, a progressive think tank dedicated to studying the American right, told BuzzFeed News that the widely accepted studies into best practices for trans youth have been undermined by a few physicians and mental health providers who espouse right-wing or explicitly anti-LGBTQ views. \\u201CPeople tend not to question folks with a medical degree,\\u201D Greenesmith said. Brennan Suen, the LGBTQ program director at Media Matters for America who has tracked the anti-trans legislation and its media coverage, said \\u201Cthe anti-LGBT right\\u201D goes to great lengths to highlight the few medical professionals who agree with them because they give a \\u201Cveneer of credibility\\u201D to the supposed dangers posed by gender-affirming treatment. One organization has played an especially significant role in boosting the claims behind the bill, including by talking with lawmakers and submitting expert testimony during legislative hearings. According to Willard with Freedom for All Americans, the American College of Pediatricians has helped shape the debate in \\u201Cnearly every state legislature pushing these bills,\\u201D including Georgia, where the first anti-trans healthcare bill was introduced, as well as Pennsylvania, Alabama, and Utah. ACP has also supported the federal bill that Republicans recently introduced into Congress. Quentin Van Meter, the ACP president, is the \\\"foremost person being cited by anti-trans advocates,\\u201D Greenesmith said. Turban, the Stanford researcher, has described ACP as a \\u201Csmall but clever anti-LGBT group [that] created a legit-sounding name.\\u201D He told BuzzFeed News that ACP is not the country\\u2019s leading organization for US pediatricians; that group is known as the American Academy of Pediatrics. In 2002, the AAP issued a statement in support of parents of the same sex, prompting a small number of socially conservative physicians to leave the group and found ACP. Since then, ACP has issued many controversial anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ statements. It is currently designated as an anti-LGBTQ hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Newer groups are also playing a role, including the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine. Last year, SEGM was cited in an Idaho bill barring trans people from changing the sex on their birth certificate. A federal court has since struck down the law. (In an email, a SEGM spokesperson said they never expressed support for the Idaho bill and that they \\u201Cobject to the politicization of healthcare.\\u201D) SEGM member William Malone told a Christian news site in 2019: \\\"No child is born in the wrong body, but for a variety of reasons some children and adolescents become convinced that they were.\\\" Media coverage has also confused matters. After initially gaining traction in the right-wing press, ACP is now routinely quoted in prominent news outlets. \\u201CWe are basically being blackmailed (into providing hormone treatments) by that adolescent who\\u2019s emotionally troubled into doing something that they don\\u2019t understand,\\u201D Van Meter told Reuters last month in an article about the Arkansas law. Although the article notes that ACP belongs to a \\u201Cminority of dissenters\\u201D within the medical community, it mentions neither the organization\\u2019s history of promoting anti-LGBTQ claims nor its certification by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group. \\u201CIt is completely irresponsible for the media to cite an extreme anti-LGBTQ group with an innocuous-sounding name like American College of Pediatricians,\\u201D said Brianna January, an LGBTQ researcher at Media Matters for America. \\u201CPlacing its dangerous disinformation next to credible sources makes it falsely appear that this is a debatable topic, skewing how the public and policymakers understand the issue. In statements to BuzzFeed News, both ACP and SEGM denied that they were promoting misinformation. Michelle Cretella, ACP\\u2019s executive director, called pediatric transition \\u201Can atrocity, not healthcare\\u201D and said that \\u201Csociety is being lied to and bullied by a medical establishment driven by a dangerous ideology and economic opportunity, not science and sound medical ethics.\\u201D SEGM member Roberto D\\u2019Angelo said the group was concerned with the \\u201Clow quality of evidence\\u201D in gender-affirming treatment. \\u201CThe key issue under consideration is how to weigh the low-certainty findings of improvements in mental health associated with medical interventions against the many known and many more as-yet-unknown long-term health risks,\\u201D he said. Opponents, including members of ACP and SEGM, have called for \\u201Chypothesis-driven randomized controlled clinical trials\\u201D to evaluate care models for treating gender dysphoria in children, but those techniques aren\\u2019t realistic or ethical, said Turban. Given the existing evidence for providing trans youth with gender-affirming care, and the fact that it\\u2019s already widely accepted in the medical field, no institutional review board would permit a randomized trial of puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones, he said. Moreover, the study could never remain blind, since the effects of being given the medication would be impossible to hide. Given the statements from every major medical association in the country, there is a clear and inarguable consensus supporting gender-affirming care. But that doesn\\u2019t mean these treatments carry no risk, Turban said. Regardless of the population or the medical issue at play, physicians are trained to weigh a treatment\\u2019s potential benefits against its risks. The same is true in caring for trans youth. Medical providers and researchers still want more data to better understand various treatments, despite an established consensus. \\u201CWe all agree that we need more data and that we wish there was more research,\\u201D said Olson, the Princeton researcher. But providers should still use the existing body of data to determine the best treatment for a trans child, she said: \\u201CI think it\\u2019s an unfair bar that we\\u2019ve created for trans healthcare.\\u201D But for now, all eyes are focused on the legislation being pushed in states across the country. And the fear in the trans community is very real. Casey Pick, a senior fellow for advocacy and government affairs at the Trevor Project, which operates a crisis intervention and suicide prevention helpline for LGBTQ youth, said their counselors have reported trans children and their families calling to ask what these bills are and when they\\u2019ll go into effect. Callers are distressed that the legislation will prevent them from getting the care they need, Pick said. \\u201CThis should not be treated as a philosophical debate,\\u201D she said. \\u201CThis is a real concrete concern to real, actual LGBT youth.\\u201D ●"},{"author":"David Mack","title":"Harry Potter Star Helen McCrory Dead At 52","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/davidmack\/helen-mccrory-dead","content":"British actor Helen McCrory, best known for her work in the show Peaky Blinders and for playing Narcissa Malfoy in the Harry Potter films, has died of cancer, her family announced Friday. She was 52. Her death was announced in a statement posted to Twitter by her husband, actor Damian Lewis. Lewis, who has starred in Homeland and Billions, said his wife died at home \\\"surrounded by a wave of love from friends and family.\\\" \\\"She died as she lived,\\\" he wrote. \\\"Fearlessly.\\\"McCrory played Polly Gray, matriarch to a 1920s Birmingham family of gangsters, in Peaky Blinders from the drama's debut in 2013. She told the Independent newspaper in 2016 that the role, like all those she enjoyed most, was appealing because of its complexity. \\\"I just want to see what she feels and what she thinks,\\u201D she said. Her costar Cillian Murphy said in a statement provided to BuzzFeed News that he was brokenhearted to have lost his friend, whom he described as a gifted actor. \\\"She elevated and made humane every scene, every character she played,\\\" Murphy said. \\\"It was a privilege to have worked with this brilliant woman, to have shared so many laughs over the years.\\\" She also appeared as Madame Kali, a powerful witch, in the horror series Penny Dreadful. McCrory had been the first choice to play murderous Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange in the Harry Potter films but had to withdraw due to pregnancy. \\\"Insurance wouldn\\u2019t cover pregnant witches!\\\" she later joked. The role then went to Helena Bonham Carter. In 2007, she was then cast as Narcissa, sister to Bellatrix and mother to Potter nemesis Draco Malfoy. \\\"Normally, it's more interesting to play the bad guy because it's usually better written,\\\" she told the Associated Press in 2011. \\\"Good is seen in a lot of drama today as a very, very dull thing.\\\" Potter author J.K. Rowling was among those paying tribute to the actor after her death.McCrory also played Cherie Blair, wife to former British prime minister Tony Blair, in two films: The Queen (2006) and The Special Relationship (2010). New York magazine praised her performance in the first film as \\\"deliciously impudent\\\": \\\"You love Cherie when she makes an ironic show of backing out of the queen\\u2019s drawing room (one must never turn one\\u2019s back on Her Majesty),\\\" the reviewer wrote, \\\"and you love Elizabeth for registering the affront while keeping her smile firmly in place.\\\" In 2017, she was honored by the real Queen Elizabeth II with an Order of the British Empire award for services to drama.McCrory started her career on the stage appearing in dozens of plays, from Chekhov to Shakespeare. Her 1995 performance as Lady Macbeth won praise from critics. \\\"The effortlessly natural Helen McCrory's performance is from another realm,\\\" read a review in the Times newspaper. She also portrayed Jehanne D'Alcy, a silent film actor and wife to French cinema pioneer Georges Méliès, in Martin Scorcese's 2011 film Hugo. She and Lewis married in 2007. Together, they had two children."},{"author":"Stephanie McNeal","title":"Influencer Taza's New Book \"A Coat of Yellow Paint\" Is Disappointing","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/stephaniemcneal\/og-mom-blogger-taza-missed-a-huge-opportunity-to-get-real","content":"This is an excerpt from Please Like Me, BuzzFeed News\\u2019 newsletter about how influencers are battling for your attention. You can sign up here.In her newly released first book A Coat of Yellow Paint, Naomi Davis, aka the wildly popular parenting blogger Taza, had a huge chance to show readers a different side of herself and get real about what it is really like raising five kids under the scrutiny of social media. Unfortunately, the book is only surface-level, with so little insight into Naomi\\u2019s actual life that I am struggling to understand why she wrote it in the first place. I had anticipated reading this book for months. Not only have I followed Naomi and her career for years (she started blogging in 2007), but I also extensively covered one of the biggest hurdles she has had to overcome. Last March, Naomi got branded, fairly or unfairly, as a selfish and out-of-touch example of everything wrong with influencer culture when she and her family left New York City in the middle of the city\\u2019s intensely scary COVID-19 outbreak. Not only did her choice, and subsequent sharing on social media, enrage some of her fans, but it also caught the attention of mainstream media like the New York Post, which called her a \\u201Crunaway blogger.\\u201D Besides a brief apology at the time, Naomi has never addressed the incident or the impact it has had on her public perception and career. The family has since relocated to Arizona, a huge change for a mom who once made living in Manhattan a core part of her brand, but Naomi has never fully explained that decision either. Many followers, myself included, wondered if Naomi would use the book, published about a year later, to offer insight and reflection on this incident. Besides that though, I also had hoped to get insight into Naomi\\u2019s life as an OG blogger. Influencer memoirs are rare, and few have revealed in detail what it is actually like to make your family into a brand that can support all of you financially. I was excited to see what Naomi would share, in a memoir that promised to contain \\u201Call-new intimate and vulnerable essays\\u201D about her personal life. I am pretty disappointed in what the book actually contains. Rather than get real and vulnerable with her readers, Naomi glosses over her life and feelings to such an extent that it genuinely leaves me confused as to who this book is for. The chapters are extremely short, barely a dozen pages long each, and the content is similarly sparse. The most maddening part is that Naomi actually does have good ideas for each chapter, and she explores some interesting topics. However, once she introduces them, she essentially cuts herself off from finishing the thought, abruptly ending each chapter with some version of \\u201CYou can do it, mama!\\u201D or \\u201CThen I learned to believe in myself!\\u201D or another platitude. Take one chapter, entitled \\u201CShe\\u2019s Getting Married.\\u201D In it, Naomi describes the judgment and reactions she faced from her peers and teachers at Juilliard when, at age 20 and in the middle of studies for her dance degree, she decided to get married. She explains how judged she felt (she was apparently told multiple times she was the only woman to ever get married in the middle of the prestigious dance program) by professors who thought she was throwing all her hard work and talent away. I would have loved to hear more about how Naomi felt preparing for studying at Juilliard her whole life, only to realize maybe that it wasn\\u2019t fulfilling all along (she alludes to feeling \\u201Cburnout\\u201D from dance, but doesn\\u2019t elaborate). In the end, Naomi says, she solved this problem by just deciding she doesn't care what people think. In fact, she writes, that\\u2019s what her husband, Josh, says when she worries about how people judge her choices: \\u201CWho cares?\\u201D So she decided not to care, she writes, ending the chapter. She applies this philosophy to several more issues in her life, writing essentially the same conclusion to other challenges she has faced like feeling judged for doing IVF in her early twenties, breastfeeding in public, and getting mean comments online. Come on, Naomi, that\\u2019s it? I\\u2019m sure it took more than just changing your mindset to get past these existential issues in your life. Another disappointing aspect of the book is how little insight there is into Naomi\\u2019s blog and career. Josh quit his job in finance to help her run the blog \\u2014 she discusses this but never shares what doing it was actually like. How fascinating would it be to get a real accounting of launching an influencer career with your husband in the mid-2010s? Instead, Naomi shares one paragraph about their journey, saying they have argued and they have sometimes \\u201Cfailed.\\u201D But ultimately, it was worth it. What? At this point, I\\u2019m annoyed. Why tease us with these interesting topics if you won\\u2019t explore them? Readers seeking any juicy tea about why the family left the city, which was such a big part of their brand that it was almost like a fifth character (or eighth in this case) à la Sex and the City, will also be disappointed. What\\u2019s even more annoying is Naomi devotes an entire chapter to her experiences in spring 2020 dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, but doesn\\u2019t explain or explore any of the huge changes that happened in her life in this period. Instead, she writes about how she felt sad and uncertain during lockdown. But, she concludes, her kids make her happy when she is sad. !?!?!?!?!!??!!?!?! I think it\\u2019s important to note that I am not writing this as a hater, but as someone who is genuinely interested in Naomi\\u2019s insights. I guess that\\u2019s why I am so disappointed. She had such potential here to really write the definitive memoir on what it has been like to be one of the pioneers of parenting influencer culture. But she won\\u2019t truly open up about any of it, so the book falls completely flat. What a shame! \\u2014Stephanie McNealI resent anytime I have to learn about another make-believe cryptocurrency, but for the sake of viral internet history, I tried my best this week. Chris Crocker recently announced they were selling their iconic 2007 \\u201CLeave Britney Alone\\u201D video as an NFT, or non-fungible token. NFTs are essentially blockchain-based currencies that value and authenticate a piece of internet content. As this explainer put it, it\\u2019s like an art collection, except with minted digital art. On Monday night, Crocker\\u2019s \\u201CLeave Britney Alone\\u201D NFT sold for over $41,000. As I\\u2019m still unpacking how to make sense of our real-life currencies and values (like market prices, stocks, bonds, etc.), I have no idea how to wrap my brain around how $41,000 in fantasy money for a YouTube video is a worthy investment. For further context (or maybe further galaxy brain explosion), the Nyan Cat meme sold for almost $600,000 USD this week. I did, however, feel like Crocker\\u2019s auction of their video was worthy. Not monetarily, but maybe symbolically. The \\u201CLeave Britney Alone\\u201D video is not only a piece of internet history, but it\\u2019s also taken on new meaning in our current climate and in recent conversations about Britney Spears. Crocker was a laughing stock in the late 2000s for tearfully defending the singer, pleading with the public to show her more grace, and comparing the situation to that of Anna Nicole Smith, who had recently died. Their video racked up millions of views within days, which broke viral records at the time. Crocker and their video existed before creators learned how to cash in and create entire careers by going viral. Not only should Crocker be able to cash in in a major way today, but their recent NFT sale, to me, is a crucial reminder of how powerful and permeating these strange viral videos continue to be in our lives and in real-world scenarios. When the Britney Spears documentary came out, there was a widespread effort to atone for once mocking Crocker and their passionate pleas. \\u201CChris Crocker was right and also deserves an apology from the media,\\u201D Twitter user @Michete tweeted in February. So the news that the \\u201CLeave Britney Alone\\u201D video is valued at $41K today feels right and restorative. Crocker\\u2019s video aged well, and it aged to a point where it\\u2019s actually making more sense and more meaningful impact than ever before. We owe Crocker an apology, and yes, maybe tens of thousands of dollars for it.

Indianapolis police said the motive for the shooting, in which five others were also injured, was not immediately known. Police responded to a report of shots fired at the facility, located near the city's airport, just after 11 p.m. They found eight victims dead at the scene, as well as the suspect, who killed himself just before officers arrived. The eight victims killed in the shooting were identified by police and the Marion County Coroner's Office as Matthew R. Alexander, 32; Samaria Blackwell, 19; Amarjeet Johal, 66; Jasvinder Kaur, 50; Jaswinder Singh, 68; Amarjit Sekhon, 48; Karli Smith, 19; and John Weisert, 74. On Friday, Indianapolis Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt identified the shooter as Brandon Scott Hole, a 19-year-old who had contact with law enforcement in the past. McCartt said Hole was employed with FedEx until 2020, but it was unclear what motivated the deadly attack. A spokesperson for FedEx confirmed that Hole was a former employee at the facility but referred further questions to police. Of the five people transported to the hospital with injuries, McCartt said four had non-life-threatening gunshot wounds and the fifth had other unspecified injuries.\\u201CWith less than 12 hours since the shooting, it would be premature to speculate on that motivation,\\\" said Paul Keenan, special agent in charge of the FBI's Indianapolis field office, which is assisting in the investigation. McCartt said Hole parked in the building's parking lot, got out of his car, and \\u201Cpretty quickly started some random shooting outside the facility.\\\" He then went inside and continued the rampage, which lasted \\\"just a couple minutes.\\\" There were at least 100 people in the facility at the time, McCartt said, and many of them were either on a dinner break or a shift change. \\\"There was no confrontation with anyone that was there. There was no disturbance. There was no argument. He just appeared to randomly start shooting,\\\" he said. When officers reached Hole, McCartt said, they found him with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The crime scene is still under investigation, and the people who were killed had not yet been formally identified, he added.As news of the attack unfolded, Indianapolis police spokesperson Genae Cook told anyone who is unable to contact a family member who works at the FedEx facility to gather at a local Holiday Inn Express. The Indianapolis Star reported that the hotel was \\\"packed\\\" later in the morning with people anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones. Law enforcement had contact with Hole in the past, although McCartt said he did not have details on those encounters. During one incident last year, he said, authorities did seize a gun from Hole. Keenan said FBI agents spoke to Hole last year after his mother reported her son might kill himself via \\\"suicide by cop,\\\" the Associated Press reported. He added that agents were called after \\\"items\\\" were found in Hole's bedroom, although he did not explain what those items were. \\u201CWe are deeply shocked and saddened by the loss of our team members following the tragic shooting at our FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis,\\\" FedEx said in a statement early Friday morning, several news outlets reported. \\\"Our most heartfelt sympathies are with all those affected by this senseless act of violence.\\\" Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Chief Randal Taylor said Thursday's incident marks the third mass shooting in the city in 2021 alone. On Jan. 24, a 17-year-old allegedly fatally shot his father, stepmother, two teenage family members, a 19-year-old pregnant woman, and the baby she was due with in a week. On March 13, a man allegedly killed four people, including a 7-year-old girl, following a domestic dispute with the mother of his child over a stimulus check. \\\"We've all been shaken by this heinous act,\\\" Taylor said. At Friday's news conference, Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett called the seemingly never-ending nature of mass shootings in the US a \\\"scourge,\\\" and said action needs to be taken to prevent such \\\"senseless violence.\\\" Days earlier, he signed a bipartisan letter from more than 150 mayors across the country calling for stronger background checks. \\\"It seems to me that, beyond the need of comfort for the grieving, we must guard against resignation or even despair,\\\" Hogsett said. \\\"The assumption that this is simply how it must be, and that we might as well get used to it, we need the courage that compels courageous acts that push past weariness.\\\" In the past month, a spate of high-profile mass shootings in the US has killed dozens. On March 16, eight people \\u2014 six of them Asian \\u2014 were fatally shot at three Atlanta-area spas. Since then, 10 people were killed in a Colorado grocery store; a former NFL player killed six people, including himself, at the home of his doctor; three members of a family in Brooklyn and four members of a family in a Dallas suburb were killed by relatives who then killed themselves; and one died and five were injured at a custom cabinet business in Bryan, Texas.Mass shootings are shockingly common in the US compared to other countries, even if they make up a small proportion of gun violence deaths. So far in 2021, at least 5,401 people have died from gun violence, not including those who have died by suicide, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive."},{"author":"Ellie Hall","title":"Prince Philip Royal Funeral Guest List","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/ellievhall\/prince-philip-funeral-attendees-guest-list-royal","content":"Buckingham Palace released the names of the 30 people who will be attending Prince Philip's funeral and additional details about the service in a press advisory to BuzzFeed News and other outlets on Thursday.

Rather, it was the recent string of crimes against women of Asian descent that made her feel more unsafe than ever, convincing her she needed to take steps to protect herself. She now carries around a kubotan, a pointy self-defense tool about the size of a pen, and a loud alarm button recommended by a self-defense instructor she worked with last month. \\u201CMaybe it\\u2019s because that [West Village attack] felt random and opportunistic, and the recent surge was so targeted towards Asians,\\u201D she told BuzzFeed News. Though the weapons might not ward off future violence, she said, \\u201Ccarrying these and practicing using them is helping me feel some agency for myself.\\u201D Choi is one of a growing number of Asian American women who say they've equipped themselves with self-defense items in recent months as more anti-Asian crimes have been reported. Of 3,800 incidents of anti-Asian harassment and attacks reported to the group Stop AAPI Hate since the start of the pandemic, 68% were against women. They've strapped themselves with noisemakers, pepper spray, metal knuckle rings, and, in some cases, Tasers and stun guns. While a group of Asian Americans told BuzzFeed News that self-defense tools and weapons are not a solution to systemic racism \\u2014 and may be illegal to carry in some states \\u2014 many expressed that the devices give them a sense of control over their personal safety following news of the lethal shooting of six Asian women in Atlanta last month and a stream of gruesome security footage of Asian people assaulted in broad daylight in the presence of bystanders. Community leaders and advocates have long decried police departments and political officials for not doing enough to proactively curb racist violence against Asian Americans \\u2014 often not even acknowledging them as hate crimes. In the absence of institutional protections, handheld instruments of defense embody the burdens these women now carry in a world that feels increasingly unsafe.Jennifer Kim, a Brooklyn resident, first bought a personal safety alarm last spring. As more people in the city were attacked, she ordered pepper spray and watched videos on how to use it in an emergency. But she wanted a backup. So this year, she got a kubotan for situations where she might need to engage physically. She keeps the kubotan and alarm on her keychain in one coat pocket, and the pepper spray in the other. She has also studied jujitsu. \\u201CIt\\u2019s just multiple ways of defending yourself,\\u201D she said. Kim said while efforts by the NYPD, like the formation of the Asian Hate Crimes Task Force, have helped her \\u201Cfeel safer to a certain extent,\\u201D she wanted to be able to protect herself when police are not around. \\u201CMost times, police aren\\u2019t present during an attack.\\u201D \\\"I definitely have that concern where I might just panic and freeze up or not remember that I have those devices,\\u201D she said. \\u201COr something can happen so fast or they come up from behind you and you have no time to react. But I guess I feel like it\\u2019s better than having nothing at all on my body.\\\"Jeanie Pai, who\\u2019s in her thirties and a native New Yorker, acquired pepper spray and a sharp cat-ear knuckle keychain over the past year. She said she bought these two items in bulk and handed them out to her closest friends and family. \\u201CI can\\u2019t say I feel safer, but the items do bring about a heightened sense of awareness and vigilance,\\u201D said Pai. Even having grown up in a densely populated area like New York City, she's disheartened by the idea that she has to equip herself with her own protection because she doesn\\u2019t feel sure that members of the public would intervene if something happened. In the case of the 65-year-old Filipinx woman attacked in Hell\\u2019s Kitchen, Asian Americans online were not only upset to watch the footage, but also that it showed witnesses standing idly by. In February, a Filipinx American man named Noel Quintana recounted to BuzzFeed News the horrifying experience of having his face slashed on an NYC subway, adding that no one on the train or subway platform came to his aid. \\u201CThe dichotomy of today\\u2019s bystander effect in urban areas is unbelievable, and it\\u2019s heartbreaking how I can\\u2019t trust witnesses to help if I\\u2019m ever attacked,\\u201D Pai said. \\u201CCarrying my defense weapon gives me peace of mind, but it is also a sad reminder of my vulnerability as an Asian woman.\\u201D These tools, she believes, are \\u201Cnot only for yourself but to protect others if you see someone in trouble.\\u201DTwitter user @kehlar, a 46-year-old Taiwanese American woman who wished to remain anonymous, felt the need to up the ante of self-defense in a major way this year: She started carrying around a whistle and alarm anytime she stepped outside her Bay Area home. She tweeted in March that she felt \\\"like an easy target\\\" because she's \\\"a petite middle-aged Asian woman.\\\" \\u201CI\\u2019m at a point now that I feel that we as AAPIs need to take matters into our own hands and protect ourselves and the vulnerable people in our community,\\u201D she said. \\u201CCarrying these self-defense items makes me feel more ready to defend myself. I\\u2019m not sure that it makes me feel safer.\\u201D RJ Castaneda, a Filipinx American resident of the Bay Area, recently bought pepper spray for his parents, sister, and female cousin. He now carries pepper spray as well when he goes out for exercise and has attended a bystander intervention workshop. \\u201CI fear randomly being attacked while running,\\u201D he said, adding that he is even more worried for his sister and cousin. \\u201CBeing a woman already has its safety concerns, but the surge in Asian attacks only added on.\\u201D Almost everyone BuzzFeed News spoke to acknowledged the pragmatism of self-defense tools as a short-term coping mechanism. These items offer protection not just from assailants but from the fear Asian Americans shoulder as they simply move through an average day. \\u201CThere are so many people who are scared and not leaving their homes,\\u201D said Barbara Yau, cofounder of the groups Concerned Asian American Citizens of New York City and Safe From Hate, which has distributed thousands of free personal safety alarms. \\u201CI think that people are just looking for confidence when they walk out the door. They want to have some kind of plan.\\u201D Yau, like many others, does not believe a few self-defense tools can fully address problems hundreds of years in the making. \\u201CI don\\u2019t think [these devices are] really a solution, unfortunately,\\u201D said Yau. \\u201CWe were hoping that news would get out and people would be afraid to attack if people had some kind of alarm. But I think it is a Band-Aid. I don\\u2019t see that it\\u2019s deterring crime at all.\\u201DThe US has a long history of anti-Asian racism and violence dating back to the 1870s, when Chinese workers who made low wages were blamed for rising unemployment rates and lynched in cities across the West. By 1925, immigrants from most of Asia were barred from entering the country. \\u201CPrevention does not solve the problem of predators,\\u201D said Pai. \\u201CA good start to a solution could be studying Asian American history in relation to Western colonialism and capitalism, and understanding the root causes of [the] Yellow Peril [narrative].\\u201D But those fixes seem far more distant than the measures available today. Choi, the 41-year-old from Brooklyn, said that immediately following the mass killings at the Atlanta spas, she organized a group of her friends, mostly Asian women, for self-defense training with a martial artist in her backyard. The class, however practical and imperative for self-protection, was also about communal processing. \\u201CThat experience was so much about being able to gather with other Asian women, connect in real time and in person over the tragedy and the violence, laugh and be worried and practice poking an eye out,\\u201D she said. \\u201CIt was about being together and remembering we have each other, too.\\u201D \\u201CDoes a self-defense class in a Brooklyn backyard dismantle systemic violence? Does it end anti-Asian racism and misogyny? Does it change gun laws in America? No and no and no. And all of that is big, big, big. But you know what would make me feel safer? If literally everyone who cares about me or everyone who cares about anyone Asian took a de-escalation training, and actually used that training when presented with a situation.\\u201D"},{"author":"Shannon Keating","title":"\u201CRuPaul's Drag Race\u201D Is Good Again. Hallelujah!","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/shannonkeating\/rupauls-drag-race-season-13-review","content":"Earlier this month I was self-isolating in my room \\u2014 PMS\\u2019ing, cranky, hitting the same pandemic wall we all are \\u2014 when a scene from the current season of RuPaul\\u2019s Drag Race shook me out of my funk with a moment of ascendant joy. By Episode 13 of what\\u2019s been, by this point, an unusually long season (no complaints here \\u2014 I\\u2019ve loved every minute), we were finally down to the top five. On Friday night, the hilarious and enigmatic Kandy Muse and sweet, smiley Olivia Lux found themselves at risk of elimination. Neither their relatively one-note performances in the acting challenge nor their looks for a \\u201CHaute Pocket\\u201D\\u2013themed runway impressed the judges; Olivia\\u2019s minidress was kind of boring, and Kandy\\u2019s fit, god love her, was just a big old mess. But they both had the chance to redeem themselves with the traditional tiebreaker \\u2014 a lip sync for their lives. It immediately became clear that Bronx-bred Kandy, who had a panic attack while filming the gossipy backstage bonus show Untucked, wasn\\u2019t ready to go home. Both queens gave it their all in a lip sync to Cher\\u2019s \\u201CStrong Enough,\\u201D turning lyrics like \\u201CYou gotta go\\u201D into fun, shady moments. But Kandy\\u2019s was by far the more triumphant performance, punctuated with a mid-routine release of confetti. I cried happy tears watching her burst into an ear-to-ear smile, twirling with joyful abandon. This was her third time in the bottom two, but Kandy was too confident (\\u201Cfuckin\\u2019 delusional,\\u201D as she put it in her interview with RuPaul last week) to let a few near losses stand in the way of the finale. While a couple of the remaining contestants have avoided ever being in the bottom, Kandy\\u2019s redemption makes her own journey that much more exciting to watch, and that much more affectingly human. RuPaul will crown America\\u2019s next drag superstar on April 23, and she\\u2019ll be selecting from the strongest top four the franchise has seen in years. There\\u2019s Kandy, mouthy and hilarious; Rosé, another perfectionist New York City queen; Symone, a small-town Arkansan turned Angeleno who has stunned the judges with showstopper looks and inspired cry-laughing with her pronunciations of certain words alone; and Gottmik, the show\\u2019s first trans man contender, a makeup artist from Arizona who\\u2019s since shown the world (and herself) that she\\u2019s also a killer comedy queen.Season 13 is drawing to a close not too long after Drag Race UK had audiences gooped and gagged the world over. The franchise\\u2019s second UK season, which awarded its top prize to Scottish queen Lawrence Chaney last month, was a critical hit and a memeable bonanza; the bizarre (and bizarrely catchy) \\u201CUK Hun?\\u201D is one of the best things the Drag Race universe has ever given us. It\\u2019s been delightful \\u2014 and surprising, honestly \\u2014 to enjoy Drag Race so much this year. Screaming my head off while watching former Drag Race stars Sasha Velour and Shea Couleé lip-synch to \\u201CSo Emotional\\u201D in a gay bar with my friends four years ago has got to be one of the biggest pop culture highlights of my life. Not too long after that, though, I\\u2019d more or less fallen out with the series. I wasn\\u2019t alone in feeling burned out and increasingly bored with Drag Race, whose subversive, irreverent beginnings had since gone comfortably mainstream. Drag Race at its best is all about bringing artists working and living on the margins to the center. TikToker Danielle Barrett recently spoofed the serious conversations that go down in the werkroom to very funny results; even though longtime viewers have seen a million of them by now, the queens\\u2019 stories about trauma and resilience are integral to the Drag Race experience. The rivalries and shade of it all make for fun TV, as do, of course, the unforgettable performances, but the hero\\u2019s journey of overcoming one\\u2019s demons, transforming the pain of alienation into something special and profound, has always been the real buy-in for me. Now that Drag Race has been on the air for over a decade, young queens auditioning for the most recent seasons were likely to have grown up watching the show. The vibe had started to feel somewhat humdrum and derivative. Plus, there was just so much of it \\u2014 arguably too much, with back-to-back regular and All Star seasons, not to mention the new international properties. I was also getting tired of RuPaul\\u2019s antics. He\\u2019s found and fostered an array of incredible talent, but he\\u2019s also had a horrible track record with anti-trans comments and an off-putting \\u201Cpull yourself up by your bootstraps\\u201D mentality that suggests a positive attitude is all one needs to overcome systemic discrimination. (And then there\\u2019s the fracking.) Last year\\u2019s season was already contending with the show\\u2019s overexposure and political issues when one of its top competitors, Sherry Pie, was disqualified following a BuzzFeed News investigation into catfishing allegations brought by multiple men. Most of the season had already been shot when the news broke; after every trace of Sherry Pie was edited out, the remaining narrative suffered. But from the ruins of that disaster rose a new season\\u2019s worth of truly formidable queens. What\\u2019s more, RuPaul has finally worked on his odious views about trans competitors and expanded the show\\u2019s working definition of \\u201Cdrag\\u201D to well beyond mere \\u201Cfemale illusion.\\u201D Gone are the days when Ru would get annoyed about seeing too much of someone\\u2019s \\u201Cboy body.\\u201D Now, cis and trans contestants alike are bringing more androgyny and gender-bending to the main stage \\u2014 and the show is so much richer for it. One clear example: Even though Lawrence won the UK crown, nonbinary superstar Bimini Bon Boulash was the obvious fan favorite. I didn\\u2019t know anything about Katie Price, the British personality Bimini impersonated for Snatch Game, but I was majorly entertaint-ed nonetheless. Bimini\\u2019s commitment to \\u201Cembracing the femme, whether you\\u2019re he, she, or them\\u201D has been dazzling to watch; from her punk-meets-high-fashion runway looks (the sheer artistry of the amoeba!) to her can\\u2019t-take-your-eyes-off-her performances, basically everything Bimini does is legendary.Viewers would be much worse off if RuPaul had stuck to his retrograde ideas about gender expression. I can\\u2019t imagine Season 13 without Mik, who\\u2019s smokin\\u2019 hot in and out of drag, adorable, charming, and so talented. Perfectly painted and dazzlingly styled, Mik was nervous to perform in the Snatch Game \\u2014 a high-stakes impersonation challenge that intimidates even veteran comedy queens \\u2014 but she ended up walking away with a win. Her Paris Hilton was a safe choice, perhaps (certainly safer than Utica\\u2019s disastrous Bob Ross or Olivia\\u2019s even more dreadful Tabitha Brown), but Mik excels at playing a \\u201Cgorg\\u201D ditz; why mess with success? (And now I can\\u2019t stop saying \\u201Cgagatondra.\\u201D) As we head into the reunion episode and next week\\u2019s finale, fans are voicing support for their chosen queen. Though Kandy is my favorite personality of the season, I think my vote for the crown would have to be Symone, who\\u2019s really in a league of her own. She is the moment. Symone brings that glamour, honey! Her most recent runway look, judge Carson Kressley noted, was worthy of Anna Wintour: a midnight-blue ball gown with voluminous statement sleeves, topped off with blonde cornrows that, as Symone explained in voiceover, emphasized \\u201CBlack excellence.\\u201D I so admire the care she takes to honor different communities and cultures in her work in ways both serious and silly, from her \\u201CSay Their Names\\u201D fascinator honoring victims of police violence to the striped scene-kid wig that paid homage to the emo kids she hung out with in high school. Symone says they allowed her to be \\u201Cgay ol\\u2019 Black Reggie\\u201D (her real name out of drag) and didn\\u2019t love her any less for it \\u2014 a moment of weird-kid solidarity that I, once a closeted emo kid myself, found remarkably touching. Symone more than anyone else this season has struggled with what RuPaul calls an \\u201Cinner saboteur.\\u201D Growing up Black and gay in rural Arkansas, Symone says, she didn\\u2019t always know that there was room for her in the world. (Watching her speak to a photo of her younger self in the latest episode had me weeping.) Her drag persona, as is the case for so many other queens, gave her the strength to be her bold and unapologetic self. \\u201CNo one can take that from me,\\u201D she says during a confessional on the most recent episode, failing to fight back tears. It was one of many moments this season that felt like a return to the best of Drag Race: when its stars are celebrated for everything that was once vilified about them, and they finally find themselves worthy of celebrating. \\u201CI love me,\\u201D she says. \\u201CI can say that now.\\u201D And now Drag Race viewers love her just as much. No matter what happens in the finale on April 23 \\u2014 some fans are predicting a Mik-and-Symone double crowning \\u2014 these queens are all superstars. During a pandemic, when I haven\\u2019t been able to spend IRL time with my beloved queer community, it\\u2019s been a real balm to bitch and laugh with these talented, outrageous, beautiful performers. Thank the gay goddesses! Drag Race is good again. ●"},{"author":"Ellie Bate","title":"Kourtney Kardashian Recalls How \"No One Wanted\" \"KUWTK\"","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/eleanorbate\/kourtney-kardashian-no-one-wanted-kuwtk","content":"\\\"This producer that met Kim had just found her really interesting and wanted to shoot with her,\\\" Kourtney recalled. \\\"They came to the store and the girl was like, 'Oh my God, you and your sisters!

The government\\u2019s long-standing theory in the case is that the extremist group came prepared for violence on Jan. 6 and stashed firearms just outside of Washington, DC, which they could easily access via a \\u201Cquick reaction force\\u201D or \\u201CQRF.\\u201D Until this week, though, prosecutors had shared little evidence other than text messages that referenced a special force. Wednesday\\u2019s hearing featured the government\\u2019s most comprehensive presentation to date that such a plan was at least partially put into action. Dozens of people are charged with assaulting police during the riots, but the Oath Keepers case is one of the few that include specific allegations that rioters had planned for violence and specifically made arrangements to have access to guns in DC, where firearms are generally restricted. Prosecutors filed a brief earlier this week alleging that Kenneth Harrelson of Florida was recorded on the morning of Jan. 7 at the Comfort Inn Ballston in Arlington, Virginia, rolling a luggage cart with what appeared to be a rifle case; the hotel is less than 8 miles from the Capitol. Harrelson is one of 12 people affiliated with the Oath Keepers who have been indicted on charges that they conspired to interfere with Congress\\u2019s certification of the election.During Wednesday\\u2019s hearing \\u2014 where the government successfully argued to keep Harrelson behind bars pending a trial \\u2014 Assistant US Attorney Jeffrey Nestler said the evidence didn\\u2019t include images of guns, but that investigators had studied the footage from the Comfort Inn and believed it showed Harrelson and other members bringing out weapons the day after the insurrection. None of the defendants indicted in the Oath Keepers conspiracy have been charged with weapon-related crimes, and the government hasn\\u2019t presented evidence that any of them brought guns to the Capitol. Nestler told US District Judge Amit Mehta that the government believed other people affiliated with the armed extremist group, whom he did not name, were monitoring events on Jan. 6 from the Comfort Inn and communicating with members who were at the Capitol. These other individuals were \\u201Cprepared to come into DC and ferry these weapons to the ground team that Mr. Harrelson was running.\\u201D In the case of Thomas Caldwell, another defendant charged in the Oath Keepers conspiracy, prosecutors have alleged that messages he sent before Jan. 6 showed him exploring options to store weapons in Virginia and have them brought into DC via pickup trucks or carried across the Potomac River by boat. Mehta ordered Caldwell to be released to home detention over the government\\u2019s objection in March. In ordering Harrelson to remain in custody, Mehta cited evidence that he was prepared \\u201Cto bring weapons into the mix\\u201D on Jan. 6 and remained in contact with members of the Oath Keepers \\u2014 particularly leader Stewart Rhodes \\u2014 in the weeks that followed. Harrelson has been in custody since he was arrested on March 10. \\u201CThat is ... strong evidence of future dangerousness,\\u201D Mehta said. In an April 12 filing, the government highlighted messages that Harrelson had exchanged with other members of the alleged conspiracy before and after Jan. 6 via a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal. On Jan. 5, Harrelson asked another member of the Oath Keepers, identified by the government as codefendant Kelly Meggs, about the address of the \\u201CQRF hotel.\\u201D Meggs replied, \\u201CDm,\\u201D which prosecutors believe stood for \\u201Cdirect message,\\u201D suggesting he didn\\u2019t want to share messages about the hotel in a group chat. According to cell site location data, Harrelson arrived at the Comfort Inn roughly three hours after messaging Meggs on Jan. 5, stayed there for about an hour, and then drove into DC. On the morning of Jan. 7, the government said, Harrelson messaged the Signal group, \\u201CSo we\\u2019re just leaving DC and I would like to know where my shits at since it seems everyone\\u2019s gone already.\\u201D Another person replied, \\u201CDid u leave it at Comfort Inn in that room?\\u201D Cell site data put Harrelson in the area of the hotel shortly after, according to the government, and that\\u2019s when surveillance video showed him with the purported rifle case.Harrelson\\u2019s attorneys have disputed that the surveillance video was proof of anything other than that he had luggage at the Comfort Inn. During Wednesday\\u2019s hearing, his attorney Nina Ginsberg tried to distance him from the actions and statements of other Oath Keepers defendants. She pointed out that he wasn\\u2019t part of what the government has described as a \\u201Cstack\\u201D of Oath Keepers in tactical gear who advanced on the Capitol, but she acknowledged there was video of him nearby urging them on; she argued that others in the crowd were cheering on the stack. She said the government didn\\u2019t have evidence that Harrelson knew most of the charged coconspirators or that he shared their motivations for going to the Capitol.Ginsberg argued that the evidence showed Harrelson was involved in planning for the Oath Keepers to provide security for Roger Stone and other speakers at rallies that day but said it was \\u201Cspeculation\\u201D to say it was proof he was planning to attack the Capitol and disrupt Congress. Mehta said the evidence was \\u201Csomewhat ambiguous\\u201D about Harrelson\\u2019s leadership role before Jan. 6 as far as planning for criminal activity, but the judge gave weight to the government\\u2019s argument that he was not an \\u201Caccidental tourist\\u201D in the Capitol. In addition to the video of Harrelson outside the Capitol near the stack, prosecutors said videos from inside the building showed him moving between the Senate and House sides and noted that he was with Kelly Meggs, who messaged someone later about looking for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The judge said the government\\u2019s \\u201Cstrongest\\u201D evidence against Harrelson was that he was \\u201Cactively\\u201D trying to find lawmakers and obstruct Congress\\u2019s activities. Of the 12 people charged in the Oath Keepers case, Harrelson is one of three who remain behind bars, along with Meggs and Jessica Watkins; Mehta has granted release to some others indicted in the case over objections from the government. The alleged scope of the conspiracy has continued to grow; a federal grand jury in DC has returned successive superseding indictments with additional defendants. The case could get even bigger; prosecutors have repeatedly referenced Rhodes\\u2019 alleged role in coordinating the Oath Keepers\\u2019 activities that day as well as other people who were supposedly with the group but haven\\u2019t been identified.

The officer, Kim Potter, resigned on Tuesday and was later charged with second-degree manslaughter. The police chief also resigned from his position. The scenes on the streets of Minnesota this week are reminiscent of last summer, when unprecedented demonstrations against racism and police brutality erupted after the killing of George Floyd.

The law, signed last month by Gov. Brian Kemp in front of a painting of a plantation where Black people were once enslaved, has been decried by activists as a means to make it harder for Black people to vote in the state. Republicans have said the law will restore voters' confidence in elections after Donald Trump lied about fraud when he lost the state to President Joe Biden. Smith and Fuqua called the law \\\"regressive\\\" and said they could not support Georgia's government. \\u201CAt this moment in time, the Nation is coming to terms with its history and is attempting to eliminate vestiges of institutional racism to achieve true racial justice,\\\" they said in a joint statement first published in Deadline. \\\"We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access. \\\"The new Georgia voting laws are reminiscent of voting impediments that were passed at the end of Reconstruction to prevent many Americans from voting. Regrettably, we feel compelled to move our film production work from Georgia to another state.\\\" It's not clear where production of the movie, which had been scheduled to begin filming on June 21, will now move to. Emancipation is the first major film or television production to pull out of Georgia in protest against the new law. The movie is backed by Fuqua Films and Smith's media company, Westbrook Inc., and was purchased by Apple Studios for a reported $105 million. Smith will play the role of \\u201CWhipped Peter,\\u201D an enslaved man whose image has continued to serve as a testament to the brutality of slavery.Following narrow losses to Democrats in the state in last year's elections, Georgia Republicans passed the law that, among other things, makes absentee voting more difficult, makes it illegal to give voters food and water while they stand in long lines, hands over control of the state election board to the Republican-led legislature, and limits the use of ballot drop boxes. It has been described as \\\"Jim Crow 2.0\\\" by Democrats and voting rights activist Stacey Abrams. Similarly, Sen. Raphael Warnock, the state's first Black senator, used his first speech to condemn the law as \\\"Jim Crow in new clothes.\\\" Calls for a boycott began online with hashtags including #NoMoreFilmingInGeorgia and #BoycottGoergia. The Writers Guild of America issued a statement warning that there would likely be repercussions if the government did not relent.With its competitive tax incentives, Georgia has become a top choice for several major shows and films, including The Walking Dead, Netflix's Stranger Things, and Marvel's Black Panther. In the 2017 fiscal year, the film industry generated more than $9.5 billion in economic impact in the state, which has led others including Bernice King, the youngest daughter of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., to question who would be worse off in the case of major protests.Earlier this month, Major League Baseball officials announced they would move this year's All-Star game and draft out of Atlanta in protest against the law. \\u201CMajor League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box,\\u201D Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \\u201CFair access to voting continues to have our game\\u2019s unwavering support.\\u201D"},{"author":"Scaachi Koul","title":"Have The Gossip Bloggers Behind Perez Hilton And Lainey Gossip Changed?","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/scaachikoul\/perez-hilton-lainey-celebrity-gossip-bloggers","content":"Every day after I came home from high school, I\\u2019d run to my bedroom, turn on my enormous, whirring black Dell desktop, and read Perez Hilton \\u2014 the up-to-the-minute celebrity gossip blog \\u2014 for hours. Paparazzi hunting young famous women and bloggers updating their whereabouts by the second created the feeling that every It girl in Los Angeles was publicly spiraling. And Hilton was there to capitalize on it. Daily, sometimes multiple times a day, he would share salacious details about Paris Hilton\\u2019s sex tape or Lindsay Lohan\\u2019s love life with a gleeful viciousness. \\u201CLet\\u2019s Get The pAArty Started!\\u201D Hilton wrote in a 2007 headline about Lohan. The post, which detailed nothing more sordid than Lohan\\u2019s return to New York City, was accompanied by a photo of Lohan with Hilton\\u2019s signature white scrawl over the top of it: \\u201CNeed crack!\\u201D I\\u2019m sure that 16-year-old me found this very funny. I was always delighted by his brutal cruelty, the grotesque doodles of ejaculating dicks he\\u2019d draw on the faces of rich, famous, beautiful women. I suppose I enjoyed seeing them taken down from their pedestals. At the time, it felt like the entire world was doing much of the same \\u2014 in July 2007, less than three years after it started, PerezHilton.com reported that the site hit a record of 8.82 million pageviews in 24 hours. \\u201CIt was just an ordinary day,\\u201D Hilton wrote at the time. \\u201CNo one was arrested or going in to rehab.\\u201D At the height of the site\\u2019s success in 2007, its most expensive ad package cost $45,000, and though blog stats at the time were notoriously unreliable, it also claimed millions upon millions of views per month. For a few gleaming years there, Perez Hilton, whose real name is Mario Lavandeira Jr., was the most talked-about celebrity blogger in the world, but by 2014, his site\\u2019s view count had taken a big hit. Unsurprisingly, his readership started to dive around the time he no longer seemed interested in calling Mischa Barton \\u201CMushy Fartone\\u201D or Jennifer Aniston \\u201CMANiston.\\u201D Hilton, now 43, has continued to run his blog, but with a much more mundane tone \\u2014 he still loves to use ALL CAPS IN A HEADLINE, but now he\\u2019s just recapping social media posts or repeating news originally broken by Us Weekly or TMZ. Regardless, his mean-spirited reputation has always followed him, as it did earlier this year with the release of Framing Britney Spears, the New York Times documentary about Spears\\u2019 public struggles and eventual conservatorship. Predictably, a big part of the documentary was about her relationship with the paparazzi and an increasingly hostile press, which was always happy to follow and mock her. Hilton wasn\\u2019t mentioned in the documentary, but around the time of its release, his old posts about Spears began resurfacing on Twitter. One, titled \\u201CBritney\\u2019s Breakdown,\\u201D ends with, \\u201CTake her children away!!!!!!\\u201D repeated five times in bold. After Heath Ledger died, Hilton sold a T-shirt with a photo from Brokeback Mountain on it that said, \\u201CWhy couldn\\u2019t it be Britney?\\u201D Almost ritualistically, Hilton has had to apologize because of how frequently his old posts reappear and remind the public that he was once the leader in blog-era cruelty. \\u201CI\\u2019ve apologized countless times,\\u201D Hilton, who lives in Los Angeles with his mother and three children, told me in a Zoom interview in late March. \\u201CA lot of what I did during that time was reprehensible and toxic. But that wasn\\u2019t everything. I wasn\\u2019t just nasty and mean and cruel and hurtful. I was also positive and supportive.\\u201D Elaine \\u201CLainey\\u201D Lui, the longtime blogger who runs Lainey Gossip, is similarly trying to make amends for her old posts. Last summer, noted Meghan Markle bestie Jessica Mulroney, a stylist and television presenter, whose husband is also among Lui\\u2019s colleagues on the Canadian entertainment show etalk, was caught in a minor scandal. Mulroney had been called out by Toronto blogger and influencer Sasha Exeter, a Black woman, who claimed Mulroney tried to threaten her livelihood and cut her off from brand deals. In a post about the scandal, Lainey suggested that it was Mulroney\\u2019s positioning as a white woman that made her think she could speak to Exeter the way she did: \\u201CThis is what makes white privilege so intimidating: it\\u2019s wrong and strong; white privilege can be STRONGER when it\\u2019s wrong,\\u201D Lui wrote. \\u201CMy complacency has made me complicit in the endorsement of white privilege, allowing white privilege to flourish and damage.\\u201DOn its face, this was a notable moment of unprompted self-reflection. But Lui hasn\\u2019t always been such a thoughtful cultural analyst, and many of her past posts began to resurface on social media after she wrote about Mulroney: She once titled a post about Jada Pinkett Smith \\u201CThe Daily Dyke,\\u201D referred to Tom Cruise as a \\u201Cgay midget dwarf,\\u201D and called Janet Jackson \\u201CGhetto Tits.\\u201D In response to her old posts going viral, Lui posted on Lainey Gossip last June about her own racism. \\u201CNot that you need this explained, but the shame must be named. My shame must be named,\\u201D Lui wrote. \\u201C\\u2018Ghetto\\u2019 is a racist term for describing Black people. Also, I was body-shaming Janet Jackson when in fact that was my shame.\\u201D Hilton\\u2019s and Lui\\u2019s blog posts exemplified the tenor of many gossip sites in the 2000s \\u2014 mean, caustic, and occasionally funny. But in recent years, as public reconsiderations of the way the media has treated young female celebrities have gathered steam, the tone of Hilton\\u2019s and Lui\\u2019s blogs has changed dramatically. The cruel jokes that once made these bloggers popular now make them cancellable, and they\\u2019re both addressing their audiences in drastically different ways. Lui is in the thick of reforming her website into commentary that no longer relies on anti-gay slurs or sexist body-shaming, while Hilton\\u2019s newfound tone is, frankly, boring \\u2014 there\\u2019s no longer anything that sets him apart from any other entertainment network, blogger, or aggregator. Celebrity blogs aren\\u2019t as directly unkind as they used to be. It is far less acceptable, for example, for a blogger to post an upskirt photo of a teenager today than it was back when Hilton and other bloggers of his ilk would post those photos of Miley Cyrus as she gets out of her car. The public discourse around mental health and drug addiction continues to become more nuanced. This isn\\u2019t to say that slut-shaming, racism, and misogyny don\\u2019t exist on gossip sites \\u2014 just that such comments are more likely to come from the followers of gossip accounts (now usually on Instagram) rather than the gossip sites themselves. It\\u2019s a change that mid-aughts gossip bloggers like Hilton and Lui have to navigate. But what kind of career revamp can you really have when, once upon a time, cruelty was your raison d\\u2019être? Lui, for one, is thinking a lot about how to make that shift. \\u201CIf there\\u2019s one time to be a little self-involved,\\u201D Lui told me over the phone in late March, \\u201Cit\\u2019s to be self-involved in your shame.\\u201DLui\\u2019s blog launched in 2003, when she was 30, originally as a newsletter she\\u2019d send to her friends. This was a pretty common trajectory for gossip blogs of that era \\u2014 no wonder reading them always felt a little conspiratorial, like you were listening in on girls confirming rumors in the bathrooms at school. \\u201CI wanted to be taken seriously, and I took it very seriously,\\u201D Lui told me. \\u201CI knew that it was an opportunity. It felt exciting to be part of something new. In the early 2000s, even the word blog, or blogging as a profession or an activity, as an act in and of itself, was new.\\u201DWhen she watched Framing Britney Spears, Lui saw herself and her work in the documentary, even if it wasn\\u2019t directly referenced. The night Spears was taken to the hospital on a stretcher in 2008, which resulted in a psychiatric hold and the beginning of her conservatorship woes, felt like the most important day thus far for gossip blogs. Lui stayed up late, knowing her readers would want her take on the events the next day. \\u201CWhen I look back on that through the eyes of now, I think to myself, that\\u2019s a news reporter following a story about a fire or a national disaster. For a lot of people, including me, that was the same approach that we were making, but for a human being.\\u201D Lui\\u2019s past missteps started resurfacing more last summer, but she said she was taking steps to rectify what she had put into the world more than a decade prior. \\u201CI really don\\u2019t have an awakening moment \\u2014 it was a gradual process,\\u201D she said. But around 2007 or 2008, one of her mentors lent her a book: How Race Is Lived in America, a compilation of articles from writers at the New York Times. \\u201CIt made me think differently about race and how different experiences shape you, and I also started to think of myself as a person, how my experience with racism is so different. It\\u2019s been shitty and it\\u2019s been painful \\u2014 not to play oppression olympics \\u2014 but even though I have been a victim of racism, I can never appreciate what it\\u2019s like to be Black in America,\\u201D she said. \\u201CAs I was reading that book, I was thinking about my own writing.\\u201D Another big part of Lui\\u2019s evolution, rather improbably, is how affected she was by the 2012 story about Kristen Stewart having an affair with Rupert Sanders, her married director, while she was dating Robert Pattinson: \\u201CI remember she issued an apology, and part of her apology [to Pattinson] was, \\u2018I love him, I love him, I love him.\\u2019 It was so much,\\u201D Lui said. \\u201CFrom there, my thought process about her apologizing became, \\u2018Are we talking about the right thing here when we\\u2019re talking about her cheating on him, and what is that conversation about? Is there misogyny here?\\u2019\\u201D she said. \\u201CThen I started noticing things I wouldn\\u2019t have been bothered by four years ago. There was a New York Post cover calling her a trampire!\\u201D Lui has never been a pun-maker, but that kind of critique \\u2014 one where a young woman was the target rather than the much older married man she was working for \\u2014 was indeed something a younger Lui might\\u2019ve written. \\u201CThat was so ugly to me,\\u201D she said. \\u201CIf you had presented that same thing to me 10 years before that...shit, I don\\u2019t know if I would\\u2019ve had that same reaction.\\u201DIn the ensuing years, Lui and her team have started to add disclaimers to old posts that are racist, anti-gay, anti-trans, sexist, or otherwise offensive. The Jada Pinkett Smith post, for example, now sports a highlighted banner: \\u201CThis article was posted during an early period of the site when some of the writing was extremely offensive. Since then our site has grown and evolved. We have apologised, continue to take accountability, and documented our changes.\\u201D The disclaimer links to an FAQ page with a lengthy apology. \\u201CI am sorry for my past sins,\\u201D it says. \\u201CI understand that accountability is not temporary and must be ongoing. I also understand that forgiveness is not guaranteed.\\u201D Other posts have been completely deleted, like the Janet Jackson one. \\u201CThey\\u2019re just so bad, it\\u2019s mostly to protect people from hurt,\\u201D Lui said. Lainey Gossip has since morphed into an anthropological, lowbrow\\\/highbrow study on fame and celebrity. These days, you visit Lainey to find out what\\u2019s really going on. In 2016, when Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were divorcing, Lui was able to keenly dissect the statements they were offering up to the gossip rags, why they picked the magazines they did, and what they were actually trying to say. And in 2018, when Jennifer Aniston did a splashy Architectural Digest feature of her then-home with her soon-to-be-ex Justin Theroux, Lui wondered if it might be because they were divorcing. (They were.) But she still has to face the humiliation sparked by her old work. \\u201CThe feeling of shame is exactly the same feeling of embarrassment that I can accurately remember, molecularly feeling the same way in high school, when something embarrassing happened,\\u201D Lui said. Looking back on her old posts brings her back to that feeling; the difference is that Lui is now 47, and hiding in her locker isn\\u2019t really an option. \\u201CI think it would be worse to not change,\\u201D she said. \\u201CI try to tell myself this is a very human response \\u2014 you should feel this way regarding these things you did.\\u201D \\u201CI don\\u2019t want to be seen as covering myself,\\u201D Lui said. \\u201CI\\u2019m not trying to sound like, yeah, I\\u2019m so brave, I eat shit. Like, then what? You shut it down, you wait for it to go away, it is still just going to follow you. You might as well eat the shit.\\u201DLike Lui, Hilton eventually realized he didn\\u2019t want to write the same way anymore. In hindsight, he compares himself to \\u201Ca hardcore drug addict.\\u201D \\u201CAttention was my drug. A drug addict, in the moment, knows what they\\u2019re doing is wrong. Most of them wish they weren\\u2019t using, but they\\u2019re doing it anyway,\\u201D he said. \\u201CPart of me wishes that I could have claimed ignorance. But I\\u2019m very honest. I knew at the time what I was doing was wrong. I just didn\\u2019t care.\\u201D For Hilton, the change in his work is reflective of a change in his mental health. \\u201COnly recently, after getting back into therapy, have I realized that for the entirety of my life, I never mourned, properly grieved, and healed from my dad\\u2019s death,\\u201D he said. \\u201CThankfully, I grew the fuck up,\\u201D he said. \\u201CAnd not everybody does that. Look at Donald Trump.\\u201D Still, it\\u2019s hard to read any of Hilton\\u2019s current work without considering how he once covered the very same celebrities. In January, he wrote a glowing post about Lily Allen\\u2019s discussion of her addictions, saying that he \\u201Capplaud[s] the star for being so open and honest about her struggles.\\u201D Yet in 2007, Hilton repeatedly wrote posts about Allen\\u2019s breasts or nipples accidentally being exposed, offering to his readers \\u201Ca good hunk of boob.\\u201D Hilton never apologized to Allen, nor has he really made any amends for all the upskirt posts, the nip-slip photo reels, the times he called Allen a \\u201Ctwat.\\u201D Unlike Lui, he has posted no mea culpa post on his blog, no banner asking for forgiveness and explaining how he has reformed. Among the worst posts in Hilton\\u2019s oeuvre were his attempts to out famous men as gay, namely Lance Bass, Neil Patrick Harris, and Dustin Lance Black. \\u201CTwo years before I came out, I was really bullied on the internet by bloggers, that\\u2019s when Perez Hilton just started and was just really malicious against me,\\u201D Bass said in 2007, adding that the extra attention on his sexuality meant he knew he\\u2019d be outed with or without his involvement. In 2009, in a post that has since been removed, Hilton published photos of Black having sex with an ex-boyfriend, promising that a sex tape would be coming too. Hilton\\u2019s attempts to out celebrities attracted criticism from the Advocate and AfterEllen.com. (A few days after Hilton\\u2019s post about Black, GLAAD would chastise him for using anti-gay slurs.) \\u201CI\\u2019ve apologized for [outing gay men] as a whole,\\u201D Hilton told me. \\u201CNot everybody has forgiven me or has been gracious about it, and that\\u2019s fine,\\u201D he said, adding that Harris is now a casual acquaintance. \\u201CHe included me in his book, [he] asked me to write something in it. I apologized in his book. So that was very nice of him. That was very noble of him.\\u201DLui mentioned that part of the discomfort of admitting that some of your old coverage failed is that it may also wash away some of your successes. Maybe this is true \\u2014 Hilton did promote queer artists and musicians on his blog, and he participated in the It Gets Better campaign as a way to reach out to queer young people. But the public will always remember your most bombastic acts first. In 2007, when he encouraged his readership to support a then-unknown Feist, he did it in a post about boycotting Britney Spears. \\u201CBritney is a frequent and habitual user of drugs and buying her song is just feeding her addictions,\\u201D he wrote. \\u201CSupport Feist!\\u201D There always seems to be another shoe to drop with Hilton. Last December, TikTok permanently banned him for violating community guidelines. It\\u2019s unclear why he was banned, but he has made a few strange and sometimes inappropriate comments about underage kids on the app. On one Charli D\\u2019Amelio video, he commented, \\u201CAnyone else think it\\u2019s inappropriate for a 15-year-old to dance to this?\\u201D On a 16-year-old\\u2019s page, he wrote, \\u201CAll these videos are getting me hard.\\u201D In a statement to BuzzFeed News, a TikTok spokesperson said, \\u201CWe are deeply committed to maintaining a welcoming and supportive community environment. Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and everything shared on TikTok, and we removed accounts that repeatedly violate our policies.\\u201D Shortly after the ban, Hilton posted a weepy video on YouTube, begging to be reinstated. But in our interview a little over three months later, he was glib about the ban. \\u201CI\\u2019m thankful! I thank them. Everything happens for a reason,\\u201D he told me. \\u201CBecause I\\u2019m cancel-proof, I will be around forever. You can\\u2019t cancel somebody that\\u2019s already been canceled 100 times.\\u201DThe celebrity gossip machine has changed quite a bit in the last 10 to 15 years. Social media, for all its ills, has made it impossible for a blogger\\u2019s worst work to go unchallenged. On Instagram, accounts like deuxmoi (852,000 followers) and the Shade Room (23 million) are now the places to go for by-the-minute updates about celebrities. Deuxmoi, an account run anonymously, posts Instagram stories of anonymous or anonymized blind items sent in by followers, thereby cutting down on any reader noise or feedback, unlike Perez Hilton and Lainey Gossip, where most readers repost and talk about the latest news on Twitter. The Shade Room, meanwhile, will dissect the comments of a celebrity\\u2019s Instagram post so that you don\\u2019t have to, putting together a narrative of who\\u2019s friends with who, who hates who, and who isn\\u2019t even speaking to who. But like celebrity blogs before it, the Shade Room has its own brand of toxicity. Instead of Hilton-type editorializing, the Shade Room team does little more than repost videos and screenshots with the 👀 emoji and let the comments do the work for them; anti-gay and anti-trans remarks flourish there with little to no actual moderation. The comments on last month\\u2019s elevator footage of Quavo and Saweetie getting in a fight in an elevator are plentiful and awful. \\u201CI think the media as a whole has gotten better, but has the general public gotten better?\\u201D Hilton asked me. \\u201CKanye West went through some very public episodes, mental-health-related, much like Britney Spears, and yet I would say more people on social media were not leading with empathy and compassion towards Kanye West.\\u201D He\\u2019s not wrong. It\\u2019s now no longer necessary for bloggers to do the heavy lifting of tearing public figures down. As the nature of celebrity changes \\u2014 thanks to the internet \\u2014 influencers have also become subjects of gossip. But instead of showing up on People.com or Dlisted, there are YouTube \\u201Ctea spillers\\u201D or \\u201Cdrama channels.\\u201D Drama channel host Rich Lux, who has nearly half a million subscribers on YouTube, makes daily videos, mostly about beauty \\u201Ccreators.\\u201D In a typical video, he talks about that day\\u2019s influencer gossip, with a full beat, a sparkly crown, and a fan in his hand for dramatic effect. Lux is friendly with a lot of the people he talks about \\u2014 including Shane Dawson and Jeffree Star, two of the most polarizing YouTubers in the makeup scene. His content often reflects that; rarely does he take a real run at someone, on the off chance they might run into each other at a Morphe store. \\u201CI\\u2019ve met James Charles and Jeffree Star, and I kind of tend to humanize them,\\u201D he said. \\u201CYou meet them, and you feel for them.\\u201D Lux is one of very few YouTube tea spillers who speak to the camera, talking-head style. Many of his competitors are anonymous, faceless YouTubers, often with usernames like \\u201CTea Spill\\u201D or \\u201CTeasurfaced.\\u201D Their videos are spliced edits of other people\\u2019s footage, overlaid with royalty-free music and saucy, snippy captions criticizing their targets. Rarely do you see a face, never mind a real name. \\u201CA lot of [gossip] creators are so scared to get canceled,\\u201D Lux said. \\u201CIf you become a popular tea channel, people want to dig stuff on you. I want to spill the tea; I don\\u2019t want it to spill on me.\\u201D Gossiping about an influencer feels so intimate, like talking shit about someone you know \\u2014 and the relatively recent phenomenon of stan culture, with its immediate and high-volume fan responses on social media, means the possibility of retribution feels higher than before. Deuxmoi is completely anonymous. The Shade Room has a staff, but you don\\u2019t necessarily know who wrote which Instagram post.But bloggers like Lui and Hilton were and are the faces of their websites. Other similarly savage bloggers, like the ones behind popular and still active \\u201900s gossip blogs Oh No They Didn\\u2019t and Dlisted (which still uses the tagline \\u201CBe Very Afraid\\u201D), haven\\u2019t had to reckon with their old posts, because they are largely nameless. Lui can\\u2019t hide from her past, but she can evolve from it, and now co-anchors two Canadian TV shows, The Social and etalk. (Neither show has publicly disciplined her over her past posts.) Hilton runs his websites, appears on reality shows like Celebrity Big Brother, and currently hosts The Perez Hilton Show, a weekly live chat on the video app Triller, where he has a little more than 6,000 followers. \\u201CIt\\u2019d be great if I was on a panel show, and I could show people who I am today,\\u201D Hilton said. I asked both Hilton and Lui what restorative justice might look like, not just for the people they insulted but for the communities they maligned. It\\u2019s not like they just wrote their blogs in a vacuum: Millions of people read their words. \\u201CFor me, part of restorative justice is making contrition an ongoing process,\\u201D Lui said. \\u201CI don\\u2019t ever plan to get to a point where I say, \\u2018I don\\u2019t want to talk about this anymore.\\u2019 I\\u2019ll talk about it as much as anyone wants me to talk about it. I don\\u2019t think an apology is a one-and-done thing.\\u201D Lui said she\\u2019s also taken private meetings with people she knows in both personal and professional capacities to apologize directly. \\u201CIt\\u2019s scary,\\u201D Lui said. \\u201CIt\\u2019s shitty. Nothing is fun. But I think it makes so much more sense than just pushing it away. I\\u2019m trying to be much more aware of not benefitting but also taking responsibility \\u2014 but not being praised for taking responsibility. It\\u2019s a very uncomfortable place to be.\\u201D Hilton, meanwhile, is convinced that his current demonization is punishment enough for his past sins. \\u201CIf I were to die today, unexpectedly, if I were to be murdered, or died of cancer and I kept it a secret, most people would celebrate. The majority of the world would be happy that I was dead, even if I leave behind three small children,\\u201D he said. \\u201CThank god, we finally got rid of him, what took so long. That\\u2019s a bitter pill for me to accept, and I accept it.\\u201D Near the end of our interview, I asked if he wanted to give one last apology for his old work. \\u201CI am sorry. I am deeply sorry,\\u201D he said. I started to wrap up our call, but he interjected one last time. \\u201CI guess maybe it\\u2019s like, I\\u2019m exhausted of saying I\\u2019m sorry, though,\\u201D Hilton said. \\u201CIt\\u2019s like, I\\u2019ve said it. Haven\\u2019t I already said I\\u2019m sorry?\\u201D ●"},{"author":"Ellie Bate","title":"Taylor Swift Explains \"Fearless\" Rerecording Process","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/eleanorbate\/taylor-swift-fearless-rerecording-process-taylors-version","content":"Taylor first announced her intention to rerecord her first six albums in August 2019 after Big Machine Records \\u2014 and, therefore, the master recordings she left behind when she signed to a new label in 2018 \\u2014 were acquired by Scooter Braun's company, Ithaca Holdings.

Why Won\u2019t She Admit That?","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/shannonkeating\/khloe-kardashian-instagram-photo-leak-body-image","content":"Earlier this week, the stewards of the Kardashian empire made some frantic (and ultimately failed) attempts to scrub a candid image from the internet. \\u201CThe color edited photo was taken of Khloé during a private family gathering and posted to social media without permission by mistake by an assistant,\\u201D Tracy Romulus, chief marketing officer for KKW Brands, told Page Six. After being posted, the image circulated on Reddit and Twitter, where threats of legal action by the celebrity family temporarily stemmed the flow. \\u201CKhloé looks beautiful but it is within the right of the copyright owner to not want an image not intended to be published taken down.\\u201D In trying to hide the photo from public view, Team Kardashian only ended up encouraging more people to seek it out \\u2014 and many of them were surprised by what they found. I certainly was, having expected an unflattering angle, perhaps, or infinitesimal chin or tummy rolls. But the apparently offending image of Khloé smiling poolside in a bikini is completely unremarkable, forgettably lovely. According to one of Page Six\\u2019s sources, the shot \\u201Cfeatures some edits,\\u201D though not nearly to the level of professional retouching we\\u2019ve come to expect from the Kardashian clan. If anything, this photo was more charming than the usual fare for its very normalcy; Khloé looks relaxed and happy. Shortly after news of the family\\u2019s scrubbing attempts broke, Khloé went live on Instagram in various states of undress, writing in the caption that it\\u2019s \\u201Cto show you all this isn\\u2019t photoshopped 😝.\\u201D In accompanying text slides, Khloé writes, \\u201CThis is me and my body unretouched and unfiltered. The photo that was posted this week was beautiful. But as someone who has struggled with body image her whole life, when someone takes a photo of you that isn\\u2019t flattering in bad lighting or doesn\\u2019t capture your body the way it is after working so hard to get to this point \\u2014 and then shares it to the world \\u2014 you should have every right to ask for it not to be shared, regardless of who you are.\\u201DMost of us know what it\\u2019s like to hate a candid snap of yourself, no matter how many of your loved ones insist you look great. For a publicity-conscious Kardashian whose carefully curated image is paramount, the stakes of a \\u201Cbad\\u201D photo are all the higher. But there\\u2019s some dissonance between the \\\"beautiful\\\" assessment from Khloé's team and the subsequent judgment that the photo didn't present her in an accurate way. Khloé casts light on that contradiction in her statement, going on to address the pressures she\\u2019s faced \\u201Cto be perfect and to meet other\\u2019s standards of how [she] should look,\\u201D which has at times \\u201Cbeen too much to bear.\\u201D For over a decade in public life, she writes, she\\u2019s been deemed \\u201Cthe fat sister,\\u201D \\u201Cthe ugly sister,\\u201D and her famous image has been hyperscrutinized and ridiculed. In the most recent edition of BuzzFeed News\\u2019 Please Like Me, a newsletter about how influencers are battling for your attention\\\", my colleague Ade Onibada notes that anyone who\\u2019s watched enough Kardashian content, including Khloé\\u2019s reality show Revenge Body, will be familiar with her many complexes about her image. Onibada writes that she \\u201Conce joked about having body dysmorphic disorder and suggested that her entire family might too, but she was \\u2018kind of into it, as it keeps us on our A-game.\\u2019\\u201D I feel for Khloé. I know what it\\u2019s like to be the heaviest girl in my friend group, to compare my body to the supposedly more beautiful and deserving bodies of others \\u2014 though my experiences, I\\u2019m sure, can\\u2019t really come close to those of the least-favored sister in one of the most aesthetically famous families on the planet. Khloé doesn\\u2019t situate herself in the context of the Kardashian beauty empire, however. She condemns \\u201Cthe impossible standards that the public have all set\\u201D for her, but she fails to acknowledge the fact that many of them come directly from her own family \\u2014 and that she and her sisters profit enormously from other women\\u2019s attempts to meet them. Perhaps we all might feel a little bit better about our imperfect human bodies if influencers like the Kardashians didn\\u2019t rake in millions from hawking unnecessary and ineffective weight loss tools, or if famously beautiful women didn\\u2019t funnel their wealth into countless cosmetic surgeries, or if filters and photoshop and Instagram Face (popularized by\\u2026the Kardashians) weren\\u2019t so ubiquitous. Celebrities like Khloé say they hate the game of excessive and extraordinarily expensive body modification as if they\\u2019re mere players with no agency or influence. But celebrities are incredibly powerful cultural figures. They\\u2019re happy to wield that power when it benefits them \\u2014 in accruing money, connections, fame \\u2014 while often refusing to admit it even exists when they\\u2019re held accountable for putting toxic garbage into the world. Khloé concludes her statement with a call to believe in beauty \\u201Cfrom within,\\u201D adding, \\u201CWe cannot continue to live life trying to fit into the perfect mold of what others have set for us.\\u201D But it\\u2019s clear from preceding slides that she isn\\u2019t so much interested in abolishing the \\u201Cperfect mold\\u201D as she is in avoiding negative feedback for contorting herself into it. She resents that her drastic efforts in self-beautification aren\\u2019t applauded by the public, writing that she takes the criticisms \\u201Cto use as motivation to get [herself] in the best shape of [her] life and to even help others with the same struggles.\\u201D All she gets in return, she writes, is being told she \\\"couldn\\u2019t have done it through hard work and must have paid for it all.\\u201D No matter how much or what sort of \\u201Cwork\\u201D she does to maintain it, Khloé has obviously paid for her body \\u2014 in money, in time, in trainers and dieticians and cosmetic procedures. And why wouldn\\u2019t we think so, when the Kardashians want us to pay them (more specifically, their fashion and beauty businesses) so that we may inch ever closer to the ridiculously unattainable ideal they promote on social media, reality television, and beyond? \\u201CThe reality is that Khloé is in a body-conscious, hypercritical prison that is partially of her own making,\\u201D Onibada writes, \\u201Cand with every decision to edit, filter, airbrush, Facetune, distort, and divorce herself from her actual image, she further fortifies this prison.\\u201D It\\u2019s extraordinarily sad to me to imagine chasing down a nice, normal photo of yourself \\u2014 in which you\\u2019re flat-stomached and wide-hipped and smiling a pretty, genuine smile \\u2014 because it\\u2019s not staged and edited to absurd levels of perfection. \\u201CKardashianism becoming tragic,\\u201D the writer Doreen St. Félix tweeted. \\u201CNow they really are an American dynasty.\\u201D It\\u2019s tempting to pity Khloé whenever another new post or video inspires petty interest in how much her face and body have changed over the years. Still, that doesn\\u2019t excuse her or her family\\u2019s consistent promotion of attaining the \\u201Cperfect\\u201D body. For her sake and for ours, she should perhaps try surrounding herself with people who don\\u2019t hold themselves or others to the same ridiculous standards. Anti-fat stigma kills, and so does the brutal pursuit of a \\u201Cperfection\\u201D that doesn\\u2019t actually exist. It\\u2019s way past time we held celebrities accountable for the ways they fan those flames. ●"},{"author":"David Mack","title":"Rapper DMX Has Died At 50","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/davidmack\/dmx-dead-obituary","content":"Earl Simmons, the performer known to the world as DMX, has died a week after he was taken to a New York hospital, his family told media. He was 50. The rapper and actor was hospitalized in White Plains late Friday, April 2, after he had a heart attack, his attorney and friend Murray Richman told media. TMZ reported that DMX had overdosed. \\\"Earl was a warrior who fought till the very end,\\\" his family said in a statement to People magazine. \\\"He loved his family with all of his heart and we cherish the times we spent with him. Earl's music inspired countless fans across the world and his iconic legacy will live on forever. We appreciate all of the love and support during this incredibly difficult time. Please respect our privacy as we grieve the loss of our brother, father, uncle and the man the world knew as DMX.\\\" The family said they would release information about his memorial service at a later time. The Grammy-nominated hip-hop star, best known for his barking style on hits like \\u201CX Gon\\u2019 Give It to Ya\\u201D and \\u201CParty Up (Up in Here),\\u201D had been open about his experiences with drug addiction, recounting in 2020 how he had first been tricked into smoking crack when he was just 14. In 2019, he checked himself into rehab. \\u201CI learned that I had to deal with the things that hurt me. I didn\\u2019t really have anybody to talk to,\\u201D he said in an interview. \\u201CIn the hood, nobody wants to hear that. \\u2026 Talking about your problems is viewed as a sign of weakness when actually it\\u2019s one of the bravest things you can do.\\u201DAfter a childhood marked by physical abuse, parental abandonment, and run-ins with police, DMX found music as a teenager while living in a group home. His stage name was taken from the DMX digital drum machine. After he signed with Def Jam, he released his first major label single, \\u201CGet at Me Dog,\\u201D in 1998, and his album It\\u2019s Dark and Hell Is Hot followed months later, debuting at No. 1 and going on to sell millions of copies. Two decades later, Pitchfork included it among its list of that year\\u2019s best albums, describing it as \\u201Cfull of ... zealous storytelling, unglued theatrics, and inexorable nihilism.\\u201D The album also contained the single \\u201CRuff Ryders\\u2019 Anthem,\\u201D declared by VH1 in 2008 to be among the 100 greatest hip-hop songs ever. As DMX gained popularity, his managers spun off into their own label, Ruff Ryders Entertainment, which became something of a hip-hop family or crew for acts like Eve and MC Jin. DMX\\u2019s second album, Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood, was also released in 1998 and went triple platinum. The cover featured DMX covered in blood, staring solemnly at the camera. \\u201CDMX's canine split personality flow is like none other,\\u201D declared the AllMusic review, \\u201Cnot only rhyming over tracks, but barking expression over explosive beats.\\u201D During his career, DMX released eight studio albums and was nominated three times for a Grammy Award, including Best Rap Album for his third album, ...And Then There Was X, which contained the hit single \\u201CParty Up (Up in Here).\\u201D In 2000, he was named Favorite Rap\\\/Hip Hop Artist at the American Music Awards.He also starred as a nightclub owner in the 2000 Jet Li action film Romeo Must Die alongside R&B singer Aaliyah, who died the following year. A New York Times reviewer declared the movie \\u201Cscattered\\u201D but said DMX emerged as a star. \\u201CHe establishes so much audience rapport in his brief time onscreen that the film suffers from his absence,\\u201D the reviewer wrote. During his life, DMX was also arrested or jailed on a number of charges, from drug possession to animal cruelty. In 2018, he was sentenced to a year in prison for tax evasion. Ahead of that sentencing, his autobiographical 1998 song \\u201CSlippin\\u2019\\u201D was played in court so the judge could hear about his troubled life. \\u201CWe thought the video would really demonstrate to the court just what he had to go through to get to where he was,\\u201D said Richman, the attorney. \\u201CIn that courtroom, you could hear a pin drop.\\u201DThroughout his life, DMX fathered 15 children with nine different women. When news of his hospitalization was revealed, artists like Missy Elliott, SZA, Chance the Rapper, and Ja Rule (with whom DMX had once feuded) all expressed their sadness on social media \\u2014 a sign of his broad influence. His AllMusic biography describes him as having taken the throne, after the deaths of Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G., as the \\u201Cundisputed reigning king of hardcore rap\\u201D who used his songs to explore spiritual anguish and street life, the sacred and the profane. \\u201CSee, to live is to suffer,\\u201D DMX said in \\u201CSlippin\\u2019,\\u201D \\u201Cbut to survive \\u2014 well, that\\u2019s to find meaning in the suffering.\\u201D"},{"author":"Ellie Bate","title":"Taylor Swift\u2019s Rerecorded \u201CChange\u201D Takes On A New Meaning","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/eleanorbate\/taylor-swift-change-lyrics-fearless-taylors-version","content":"The rerecorded versions are almost indistinguishable from the originals, meaning we get to stream Fearless guilt-free as if 2008 never ended.

She ultimately refused, knowing he had plans to sell the label. She made the choice to prioritize her future over her past. But, she said, she never dreamed Scott would sell the label to Scooter Braun. \\u201CThis is my worst case scenario,\\u201D Taylor wrote at the time. \\u201CThis is what happens when you sign a deal at fifteen to someone for whom the term \\u2018loyalty\\u2019 is clearly just a contractual concept. And when that man says \\u2018music has value,\\u2019 he means its value is beholden to men who had no part in creating it.\\u201D \\u201CAny time Scott Borchetta has heard the words \\u2018Scooter Braun\\u2019 escape my lips, it was when I was either crying or trying not to,\\u201D she went on. \\u201CHe knew what he was doing; they both did.

It created the mold of plopping diverse people into a single space and letting the drama unfold, assembling seven castmates in an apartment in a big city \\u2014 from New York to New Orleans \\u2014 and chronicling the conflicts that emerged when they lived together for months. Years later, big networks took this concept and changed the setting, sticking people into the Big Brother house and the wilds of Survivor for mass-market versions of this pressure-cooker entertainment. But The Real World was first. And everything, from the mundanity of who was doing the dishes to more complex romantic and friendship entanglements, could erupt into a power struggle. In the first season, set in New York, roommates vying for access to a house telephone turned into a debate about race and class. A fight between a white castmate and a queer Black castmate in the Seattle season led to a \\u201Cslap heard round the world.\\u201D One castmate had an abortion in the Los Angeles season, and another was evicted for sexual misconduct. The franchise lost ratings and relevance as slice-of-life reality shows proliferated on cable TV. Its final season aired in 2017. By then, reality shows were less invested in bringing \\u201Cdiverse\\u201D strangers together and more in mining specific subcultures, from Jersey Shore dwellers to proto-Instagays, wealthy Black women doctors, and the South Asian diaspora in Miami. Still, the show remains one of the most enduring subjects of Gen X and millennial nostalgia. And as the failures of representation on reality TV have reached a breaking point, a Paramount+ reboot, The Real World New York: Homecoming, has brought the castmates from the original first season back together to grapple with the racial politics over the course of their six episodes. Reunited in the same Soho loft from 1992, the original cast has rehashed some of their clashes and debates with the benefit of hindsight. For the first Black castmates, the reboot has also been an opportunity to highlight the original show\\u2019s mishandling of representation. \\u201CReality television provides the platform for people who haven\\u2019t been able to tell their stories to tell their stories,\\u201D castmate Heather B., now a radio personality, told me in March. But there didn't seem to be room for the full picture. Her backstory didn't make it onto the original show, making her \\\"a unicorn,\\\" she joked. \\\"They didn\\u2019t show my mother or my father.\\\" The show often sacrificed nuance in favor of drama when framing the Black castmates for the network\\u2019s predominantly white audience. Kevin Powell, an author and activist, was positioned, as Heather B. puts it in the reboot, as the \\u201Cangry Black man.\\u201D For Kevin, Homecoming has been an opportunity to reclaim his story. \\u201CThrough the years, I was hurt, I was depressed, I was sad about it; I avoided talking about The Real World at all,\\u201D he explained in an interview with me in March. \\u201CComing back has actually been healing because I got to say a lot of the things that I didn\\u2019t get to say back then.\\u201DJonathan Murray, an openly gay man who cocreated the show with Mary-Ellis Bunim (who died in 2004), told me he always wanted diversity to be \\u201Cpart of the show\\u2019s DNA.\\u201D After a scripted version was deemed too expensive, they turned to the documentary format, with the \\u201Cidea of a bunch of people living together who normally wouldn\\u2019t live together who were from all different kinds of backgrounds,\\u201D he said. The castmates were all in line with the MTV brand: young, good-looking people pursuing creative professions. They included Eric Nies, already a successful model in New York City seeking to make it in entertainment; Julie Gentry, from Alabama, who wanted to break out as a dancer and performer; Andre Comeau, a long-haired aspiring rocker; Norman Korpi, a designer trying to break through in the New York art world; and Becky Blasband, an emerging singer-songwriter from New York. Kevin was already a successful freelance writer and spoken-word poet, while Heather B. (née Gardner) was trying to make it as a rapper. For Heather B., the show represented an opportunity to get on MTV as a woman rapper, long before the social media\\u2013fueled reign of Nicki Minaj and Cardi B. Queen Latifah and MC Lyte were garnering attention, but, as Heather B. points out, there were few ways for rappers like her, early in their careers, to get national screentime. \\u201CI had no expectations, except that when the camera gets on me, I could talk about what it\\u2019s like being a female rapper.\\u201D Kevin, who around the time of the show was writing the first cover story for then-new hip-hop magazine Vibe, said he knew \\u201CMTV was a big brand at this time for young people \\u2014 I just thought maybe I\\u2019d get some speaking gigs out of it.\\u201D There was no reality television industry or reality-TV-star-to-influencer pipeline, but The Real World already depended on a kind of bargain between castmates and production. The castmates wanted screentime, and the producers wanted storylines that would be relevant to the MTV audience. \\u201CWe believed that when you live with people different from the people you grew up with, you\\u2019re gonna make mistakes,\\u201D said Murray, \\u201Cbut you\\u2019re also gonna grow, and that growth would be our story arc.\\u201DIf the show was about young people\\u2019s evolution, we saw that most fully with Eric and Julie. Julie got the most fleshed-out arc, with her turn from sheltered Alabama girl to independent woman in the big city. We see Julie\\u2019s origins at her home in Alabama and in disagreements with her dad. She goes to dance practices and pursues her profession. The episode \\u201CJulie in a Homeless Shelter?\\u201D captures the cringey after-school-special flavor of how reality television dealt with social issues: Julie randomly visits an unhoused Black woman, Darlene, presumably to show us how open and charitable she is. No one who watches the show would be surprised that it was Eric who broke out the most definitively afterward (he got handpicked to host the dance show The Grind). There are endless shots of him on modeling shoots. He\\u2019s also framed as a relatable everyday person, trying to make things work with an ex-girlfriend; he goes to a basketball game with his unavailable dad. We see Eric\\u2019s open-mindedness as he is flirty with Norman, who was openly bisexual on the show and is now out as a gay man. Ultimately, Eric and Julie were the vectors of relatability for the network\\u2019s audience. Heather B., in contrast, was turned into a kind of foil for all the other castmates\\u2019 stories. Some professional elements of her life were featured: She\\u2019s shown at the studio, crafting her sound and presciently rapping about date rape in the song \\u201CThe System Sucks.\\u201D But even though she shot some scenes with her father, they never made it on the show. (In contrast, she meets Julie\\u2019s mother in one scene.) And very little of her personal life or background did either. \\u201CI don\\u2019t even think people stop to think what my family history was,\\u201D she told me. \\u201CI was almost like every roommate\\u2019s roommate in the house. \\u2026 \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019m hanging out with Heather.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, let me go talk to Heather.\\u2019 But nobody really knew my story.\\u201D \\u201CYou keep hearing the same story over and over again,\\u201D she said of the kinds of mainstream narratives available for Black people at the time, \\u201Cso you believe that is the story for every Black person \\u2014 that you grew up in a single [parent] home.\\u201D Her own background seemed to slip by producers: \\u201CI went to private school. I had my own room. I had my own telephone number. \\u2026 I had my brothers. We went on family vacations together. I was raised Catholic. Why not show that?\\u201DBut The Real World was not invested in showing the complexity of the Black experience or intragroup differences. In retrospect, it often exploited the idea of clashing perspectives among groups \\u2014 between straight and queer castmates, and between white ones and people of color. And it was Kevin who was often edited into the latter storylines. In one disagreement, Becky describes the US as a \\u201Cmelting pot\\u201D and \\u201Ca land of opportunity.\\u201D Kevin disagrees and talks about the system being \\u201Cstacked.\\u201D \\u201CRacism is race plus power,\\u201D he says at one point. \\u201CYou\\u2019re full of shit,\\u201D she says. \\u201CYour mother\\u2019s full of shit,\\u201D he replies before muttering, \\u201Cstupid bitch.\\u201D (Kevin apologized in the reboot, and admitted to me: \\u201CI was a sexist pig.\\u201D) In a debate with Julie, he tries to talk about her position as a \\u201Cwhite girl\\u201D from Alabama. \\u201CI come from a particular background. You come from a particular background,\\u201D he says. \\u201CGet off the Black\\\/white thing \\u2014 I\\u2019m sick of it,\\u201D she replies. \\u201CWhat are you going to do? Hit me?\\u201D \\u201CWhy do you assume because I\\u2019m a Black man I\\u2019m gonna hit you?\\u201D Kevin says. These conversations about race might have been new for primetime MTV, but they barely scratched the surface compared to the ones Kevin was used to having. \\u201CBy the time I got to the show, I had experienced so much through my teens and twenties, around race, racism protests, rallies \\u2014 all kinds of stuff,\\u201D he recalled to me. \\u201CI had read tons of stuff on history and rooted in anti-racism work, but it never really came out even in the interviews [with casting], because, honestly, I wasn\\u2019t asked.\\u201D (He recalls only one Black woman working behind the cameras at that time.) Still, the clashes and his attempts to talk to the clueless castmates clearly made for good television. The fights reach a crescendo toward the end of the season, in the kind of \\\"he said, she said\\\" game that is now de rigueur on Real Housewives. Julie tells the castmates that, in an offscreen argument, Kevin cursed her out and almost threw a candleholder at her. Kevin says Julie picked up the phone and asked him to get off right as he was in the middle of a serious job interview; he admits that he lashed out at Julie but says he never threw anything at her. \\u201CIt became quickly obvious to me then that I was talking to folks who had never experienced anything,\\u201D he recalled of his castmates\\u2019 lack of awareness regarding discrimination or other points of view. \\u201CI felt compelled to say something, just based on who I was and what I\\u2019d experienced \\u2014 or debates or arguments, depending on your perspective. But it was all organic.\\u201D Whether any reality TV conflict can truly be organic is a fraught question, given the typically heavy involvement of producers through editing. (Showrunner George Verschoor mentions in the reboot that 60 hours of footage a week were whittled down to 24-minute episodes.) Either way, Kevin got lots of screentime when his activism stirred the pot; it made for great drama, regardless of how it made him come off. Yet he didn\\u2019t get the same 360-degree treatment as his white counterparts. There are brief shots of Kevin teaching Black and brown students at a weekend class at NYU. We see a snippet of him at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe performing spoken-word poetry about his family and meeting his mom. But his life as a writer, where he would express ideas about these issues on his own terms, wasn\\u2019t included. (He recalls telling the producers how important Vibe magazine, backed by Quincy Jones, would be.) Ultimately, Kevin\\u2019s moments as the \\u201Cangry Black man\\u201D led to massive viewer backlash. \\u201CLetters, mail \\u2014 lots of mail \\u2014 and things people would say to me publicly,\\u201D he recalled in our interview. \\u201CThere were people who avoided me at MTV. I realized people had created judgments.\\u201D In interviews for a media job, an editor told him his portrayal on the show had soured many people on working with him. Even his mother \\u201Cwas terrified,\\u201D he says in the reboot. \\u201DShe said, \\u2018Don\\u2019t ever talk to a white woman or white person like that again.\\u2019\\u201DThe Real World pioneered the concept of bringing strangers together as a microcosm of the American experiment. PBS arguably invented reality television in the early \\u201970s when they turned the lives of the Loud family in California into the multipart series An American Family. But the conceit of assembling people from diverse backgrounds as a story unto itself became part of the core of reality television. \\u201CIt\\u2019s sort of an old-fashioned liberal idea,\\u201D Murray said of the show\\u2019s genesis, \\u201Cthat we\\u2019re really all the same \\u2014 you just have to cut through all the other stuff to really get down to the core.\\u201D Of course, however similar we may all be on the inside, people don\\u2019t have the same experiences in the outside world. While the show changed the landscape of television, diversifying the kinds of identities that could get a platform, it also normalized the idea that castmates of color (especially Black ones) are expected to perform emotional labor for white audiences. \\u201CWe wanted to reflect voices that had not been heard,\\u201D Murray recalls of the idea behind The Real World. Throughout the \\u201990s, the show did provide many of the channel\\u2019s suburban white viewers\\u2019 first casual peek into the experiences of people of color, and many straight viewers\\u2019 first exposures to queer life and politics. But in retrospect, that first season comes off as an attempt to educate the network\\u2019s majority-white audience about race in America rather than providing a platform for the castmates whose voices had not been heard on the network. Reality television is an exchange of personal experience for visibility, a transaction that can be more fraught for castmates of color on a network with mostly white production crews. Today, Murray acknowledges there was a lack of racial diversity behind the scenes. \\u201CI think, from the beginning, we had pretty good representation on the crews as far as gender and sexual orientation diversity. Where we\\u2019ve struggled more, quite honestly, is in racial diversity,\\u201D he admitted in our interview. \\u201CWe sort of realized after that first season that if you\\u2019re gonna cast a diverse show, you need to have a diverse crew. You don\\u2019t want the cast looking back and not seeing anybody who looks like them or who they just don\\u2019t feel like shares any of their life experience.\\u201DIn Homecoming, all the castmates come back to the loft for a new, shorter Real World season. They revel in nostalgia and the passage of time, pointing out how much they\\u2019ve aged; some are parents now. But the reboot quickly turns to one of its main themes: the idea that The Real World was always political. The castmates view footage (unseen by viewers at the time) of themselves in 1992 watching the Rodney King verdict, a flashpoint for police brutality. They sit around the loft, like they did almost 30 years ago, and discuss how George Floyd\\u2019s killing has galvanized people again. In particular, the reboot seems designed as a vindication of Kevin. \\u201CKevin was labeled the angry Black man,\\u201D Heather B. says in one conversation. \\u201CKevin wasn\\u2019t wrong, \\u2019cause fast-forward \\u2014 where\\u2019s the lie?\\u201D Kevin gets a less one-dimensional edit this time around, allowing him to showcase his expertise and talk about his experiences since the show. Growth remains a focus of the program, and the white castmates get to talk about their own. \\u201CIt took this many years to realize I have to be anti-racist,\\u201D Julie tells the group. Becky, though, makes herself into a caricature of the Becky meme. She talks about taking an Afro Brazilian dance class in which she \\u201Clost\\u201D her skin color. This time, not just Kevin, but all the castmates, try to get her to see how she\\u2019s coming across. She leaves the house in a huff. On a walk with Julie the next day, she says, \\u201CI\\u2019m not there to be the poster girl for white privilege.\\u201D During a FaceTime call with Kevin in a subsequent episode, she accuses him of \\u201Cpolicing\\u201D her words and hangs up on him. She never returns to the house. The show breaks the fourth wall during the last episode. Murray and Verschoor appear onscreen and ask the castmates about what they wish had been included. Heather B. talks about those scenes with her father \\u2014 and we finally see the missing footage of them at a restaurant. \\u201CPlease don\\u2019t ever do that to another Black girl again,\\u201D she said later, adding, \\u201CThere\\u2019s a lot of Black women out here, Black girls who need to see that.\\u201D Homecoming emphasizes the idea that as much as things change with racial politics, they also stay the same. The same is true of reality television\\u2019s failures around racial representation. Black castmates on reality television continue to highlight pay discrepancies with white castmates. They have also spoken about the way that castmates of color are expected to share certain kinds of trauma and often get depicted as angry. And the lack of diversity behind the scenes remains a problem. Heather B. went on to release her first album, Takin\\u2019 Mine, in 1996. She points out that her record label was confused about why MTV wouldn\\u2019t play her videos. \\u201CIt took a very long time for people to make the distinction that I was very serious about my rap career,\\u201D she said, recalling that at the time being on MTV \\u2014 not a hip-hop hub at all \\u2014 was seen as selling out. \\u201CAnd thank god I ended up being very successful as a full-time recording artist, but it took some time to get to that point.\\u201D In the aughts, she segued into radio. She now hosts three shows, including The Happy Hour With Heather B. and Sway in the Morning (she\\u2019s a cohost). Kevin went on to write 14 books, including a memoir, The Education of Kevin Powell: A Boy\\u2019s Journey Into Manhood, and cover stories about Tupac Shakur for Vibe and Rolling Stone. (Shakur became a fan in part from seeing him on the show.) But he was always ambivalent about The Real World experience. \\u201CYou feel disempowered when things are taken out of context, and people draw conclusions because they don\\u2019t see the full story,\\u201D he said. \\u201CSometimes it doesn\\u2019t have to be other people making you invisible \\u2014 sometimes it\\u2019s making yourself invisible because of the pain you carry around, simply because of who you are.\\u201D At the same time, many people have told him he made them think about race in a different way. \\u201CPeople have always quoted to me: 'Racism is race plus power,'\\u201D he says. \\u201CI\\u2019m sure they\\u2019ll make some memes of us now.\\u201D ●"},{"author":"Ellie Bate","title":"With \u201CMr. Perfectly Fine,\u201D Taylor Swift Gets Ahead Of The Drama","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/eleanorbate\/taylor-swift-mr-perfectly-fine-joe-jonas-sophie-turner","content":"In February, Taylor confirmed that the rerecorded version of the album would include six tracks ~from the vault~ that she\\u2019d written during the making of Fearless but hadn\\u2019t made it onto the record. \\u201CI\\u2019ve decided I want you to have the whole story,\\u201D Taylor wrote in her announcement. \\\"See the entire vivid picture, and let you into the entire dreamscape that is my Fearless album.\\u201DWhether it was simply a result of maturity, her long-term relationship, or the entire world turning against her and her persona, Taylor has rebranded. In many ways, 2017\\u2019s Reputation was the beginning of the complete upheaval of Taylor\\u2019s persona, and it\\u2019s only continued since then. Her 2020 albums, Folklore and Evermore, were her least autobiographical ever, with Taylor choosing to draw from the experiences of fictional characters and fabricate new ones entirely in her songwriting rather than putting her own most personal moments on a platter for public consumption. \\u201CThere was a point I got to as a writer who only wrote very diaristic songs, that I felt it was unsustainable for my future moving forward,\\u201D she told Zane Lowe in an Apple Music interview around the release of Evermore. \\u201CIt felt like too hot of a microscope.

And then she acknowledged \\\"in a goblin voice\\\" that her 2008 music goes against that new, chill outlook entirely.Posting a link to the song on her Instagram story just a few hours after it was released, Sophie made sure to tag Taylor directly, and wrote, \\u201CIt\\u2019s not NOT a bop.\\u201D \\u201CForever bending the knee for the 👑of the north,\\u201D Taylor wrote in response. (Joe has been silent on the matter, but his blessing matters less. If the \\u201CDrivers License\\u201D debacle taught us anything, it should be that even if a girl writes a song about a boy, people will find a way to turn it into a feud with another girl.) And so, great tweets were written, beef was preemptively squashed, and lessons were imparted: There doesn\\u2019t always have to be drama. There can just be bops. By releasing \\u201CMr. Perfectly Fine\\u201D just a couple of days ahead of Fearless (Taylor\\u2019s Version), Taylor anticipated and shut down any overused and outdated criticism that may come about as a result of her revisiting her past. She's telling the world that she\\u2019s both aware of and laughing at the possibility of tabloids attempting to stoke decade-old drama.

This year marks the 10th anniversary of Photo Vogue and Glaviano\\u2019s 20th anniversary at Vogue Italia \\u2014 big milestones for a woman who used to buy copies of the magazine at a corner store in New York every month. We may associate models in bright clothes with fashion photography, but images that are thought-provoking, discomforting, and inquisitive are what compelled Glaviano toward the field. We asked her about the photographers and images that influence her. She said that two things interest her: people, and what we can do to help them. \\u201CI like images that restore that complexity. My passion is to discover new things, to be able to change my mind about something,\\u201D she told BuzzFeed News. Here are just a few of the photographers and works that inspire Glaviano. This list has been condensed and edited.\\u201CThis is from the 1980s, it was photographed in St. Barts. My father\\u2019s work was my first aesthetic influence. It was not always an easy father-and-daughter relationship, but he introduced me to the world of art and fashion. When I was a child, he used to work for Vogue and Harper\\u2019s Bazaar. He lived in New York at the time, and I would go hang out on sets. This was a seed of what made me so passionate about photography. I\\u2019m also more aware now of certain biases I have. If I think back, most of the artists who influenced me are Western artists.\\u201D\\u201CIn my opinion, he is one of the most powerful photojournalists from the last century because of his ability to frame and compose images, even in such conditions, the care and attention that he dedicates to his photographs is the same care and attention he has to his subjects and the causes he denounces. The first thing that comes to my mind by looking at this image is the very strong reference to [Andrea Mantegna\\u2019s 'Lamentation of Christ']. I don\\u2019t even think that reference is conscious, but to look at the image and see the death of Christ, it\\u2019s already a photograph that makes you think. We are complex, full of contradictions; this complexity is something that is not accepted in our contemporary world. \\u201CAll of the issues that we need to reflect on when we speak about images of suffering, images of war, Susie Linfield wrote about in her book The Cruel Radiance: Photography and Political Violence, a must-read for people who are concerned with the history of photo criticism. Why do we judge the morality of the photographer more than what the picture is showing us? Can an image be at the same time horrible and beautiful?\\u201D\\u201CThis image was taken by Tomada in Afghanistan, and I published it in Photo Vogue in 2011. I had just opened up Photo Vogue, a platform I curate and direct. I published this image as the picture of the day, and the late Franca Sozzani, who was the editor-in-chief of Vogue Italia at the time, called me and said, \\u2018Alessia, what are you doing publishing images of war?\\u2019 But I fought for it. I said that I didn\\u2019t want this platform to just be for fashion photography. Of course, it\\u2019s Vogue, but Vogue is a brand, and I feel that we should be talking about everything. I stood up for something I believed in, and we kept it. Today, Photo Vogue has submissions from more than 240,000 photographers from all over the world, and we speak about so many different issues.\\u201D \\u201CThis image is the epitome of one of the things I love the most about art: when there is meaning but also strong, powerful aesthetics at the same time, when images are powerful and immediate from an aesthetic point of view so that they are accessible to everyone. I don\\u2019t want to take two hours just to speak about this, but the camera in the middle, the woman looking at us, the photographer \\u2014 there are so many concepts in this image. You can be struck by the beauty of this image and the fact that you don\\u2019t really understand it. Is there a mirror? What\\u2019s going on? The picture lends itself to several readings and interpretations. It speaks about the representation of women but also challenges our capacity of observation and questions the role of photography as a witness of reality. All of this is condensed in just one image.\\u201D\\u201CShe is an incredible artist. I think what she did for photography was immense. She had an influence on so many generations and so many other incredible artists after her. She started, if you like, a social media approach to photography before anyone else, before even social media. She started a documentary, diaristic approach. Nan was photographing her community. This image is from The Ballad of Sexual Dependency, which was an achievement of the arts in the 1980s. The idea of this community of friends, all nonconforming people, and capturing intimate moments with this extended family and moments of love and loss. People like Wolfgang Tillmans, Corinne Day, and Ryan McGinley, they all come from there. She also worked in fashion. She loved fashion. Her work really, really touched me when I was a teenager, so she has a particular place in my heart.\\u201D \\u201CWe\\u2019re speaking about incredible artists \\u2014 all these people are changing the medium of photography or introducing new languages. Arbus started photographing the unfamiliar. It\\u2019s interesting to think about how we would judge her if had she lived and were photographing this today. The reception would be different, of course, and luckily these days we are more aware and respectful, but these images need to be contextualized; you can\\u2019t judge an artist of the past or their art with the awareness of today. When she started to do this, it was amazing that someone would turn their camera to show us these uncommon and uncomfortable scenarios and people. She didn\\u2019t want to reform life; she wanted to understand it. It\\u2019s about compassion and sympathy for the imperfections. The fact that she killed herself in 1971, she was herself someone who was suffering. Her ability to show us the unfamiliar and not to judge, her images are never judgmental. She has been an incredible inspiration.\\u201D\\u201CThis image is for a story for W magazine in 2000. It\\u2019s a reference to Edward Hopper. I am a big believer that fashion is a language and speaks about identity. When you take a fashion picture, you can go buy the clothes \\u2018advertised\\u2019 in it for six months \\u2014 but after that, the image becomes a document. There are so many incredible images. If you think of Richard Avedon or Irving Penn, they started in the pages of a magazine, and today they are on the walls of museums. DiCorcia is someone I\\u2019ve looked at a lot. The theatrical representation of reality in photography, images that are never didactic or rhetoric \\u2014 and by looking in and looking more, you understand that there are other things at play in the images.\\u201D \\u201CHer work touched me a lot. The way she was taking pictures of herself and blending in with what she was photographing \\u2014 the walls of the room, nature, the trees. The idea of disappearing and blending in, the idea of fragility and of exposing oneself, it\\u2019s the female gaze before the female gaze. If you think of how much she is loved, it\\u2019s because her work is so authentic, and that is why we still respond to it so strongly.\\u201D\\u201CCrewdson is a friend. I remember going to see an exhibit of this series in New York in the \\u201990s. The work was inspired by the dioramas in the natural history museums. If you look, you will see already all the themes he will explore in his career. I love this image. I love this entire series. I love his approach to mystery and the uncanny. It\\u2019s very clever how he can speak about the uneasiness of life, the so-called suburban normalcy in America, how mysterious it can become. It makes me think of Close Encounters of the Third Kind. I prefer the still image to the videos. It\\u2019s more interesting. It\\u2019s open-ended. Photographs that are about the moment of transition between before and after \\u2014 but you don\\u2019t really know what happened before and after, you are filling in the story with your imagination. That\\u2019s something that he believes in, and I do too.\\u201D\\u201CWe all know there is a world before and a world after 9\\\/11. I had just moved back to Milan after many years in New York. I had only been gone two months to take the job at Vogue Italia. I think this image is a metaphor for the surreality of what happened. It was so heavy when we all witnessed it on TV. It was so surreal how incredible and ambiguous and confusing it was. This is all in this image, which is not at all that these people are there and they don\\u2019t care what\\u2019s happening on the other side of the bridge. This is just a frame, a moment in time. Images aren\\u2019t always the truth, and we don\\u2019t know what they were saying, how they felt.\\u201D\\u201CI think that there is a before and an after Ryan McGinley in fashion photography. He was able to create this work that didn\\u2019t exist before. Again, he was documenting his friends, but he was living in the East Village and surrounded by super-cool people like Dan Collin and Dash Snow. He brought a joyful documentary style to his photography \\u2014 the idea of freedom, a celebration of life, being in nature, and even the way that he treated gay male bonding in a refreshing, direct, immediate, and autobiographical way without being narcissistic.\\u201D\\u201CJosephson made me understand the importance of referencing other work. At times, it\\u2019s hard to know who started something. It\\u2019s like Guy Bourdin \\u2014 they both used illusions to draw your attention to the artifice of the picture, the picture itself being an object. He was an intellectual about photography, and this image reminds me also of the concept that the map is not a territory. That means individuals don\\u2019t have absolute knowledge of reality. You look at things with a model you have in your mind as how it should be, but when you go out and see the places, that is real, not the map. Representation is representation, it\\u2019s not reality. \\u2018Ceci n\\u2019est pas une pipe.\\u2019\\u201D\\u201CThis is another example of how you can\\u2019t really label things and divide them. You look at his series Brooklyn Gang\\u2026 These could all be fashion images. There are so many documentary photographers that I admire like Davidson. Danny Lyon, for one. They were documenting their communities, what was going on, where they were living. The people they photographed had such great style; they could just as easily be fashion images. It\\u2019s important not to label, to be open, to look at what you have in front of you without judging.\\u201D\\u201CI lived in New York when this cover came out, and I would buy Vogue Italia every month. It was my dream job. I loved it so much. It had everything \\u2014 strong aesthetics and important concepts, and most of that was through the lens of Meisel. I chose this particular image, but it could have been any other cover from the \\u201990s. It references \\u2018Relation in Space,\\u2019 a 1976 performance by Marina Abramovic and Ulay. Meisel is my favorite fashion photographer of all time. He wrote many chapters of the history of Vogue Italia, and he is more capable than any other of overturning conventions, breaking rules, and using fashion as a lens to talk about so many other things, from the obsession with plastic surgery to oil spills to mental health. Voracious in terms of his influences, he looks at everything, absorbs everything, and does it better and in his unique way without ever plagiarizing. He has been a huge influence on my aesthetics.\\u201D\\u201CThis is part of the Female Gaze exhibition from the first edition of the Photo Vogue Festival in 2016. I proudly call it the first conscious fashion photography festival, which works at the intersection of ethics and aesthetics, because this has been my mission since day one. \\u201CMy awareness of what was happening with the female gaze started when I interviewed Bettina Rheims, a great friend and incredible artist. For over 30 years, Rheims has produced work that explores and investigates the female body, identity, and gender issues. She made me think about taking back the male gaze and photographing women in a way usually done by men. Women are always being asked to conform to that and take upon themselves the same objectifying point of view. \\u201CThis was the beginning of an awareness that brought me to identify all the contemporary young women who are using photography in this sense, who shifted their lens onto other young women producing nonstereotyped images with a strong erotic component that are a manifesto of sexual emancipation and reappropriation of one\\u2019s body. A body that is real, authentic, and portrayed with all its signs and imperfections that are no longer seen as \\u2018mistakes\\u2019 to be retouched. Finally, we arrive at a more sincere and truthful representation of women. I think it\\u2019s the most important thing that has happened to photography in the past 10 years.\\u201D\\u201CThis image was in the exhibition A Glitch in the System at Photo Vogue festival in 2019. It is a symbol of many of my battles regarding representation. The idea of diversity, there are different kinds of bodies and different beauties. Romina photographed many different women referencing Botticelli\\u2019s \\u2018Venus.\\u2019 A Glitch in the System is a continuation of what we started the year before with the exhibition Embracing Diversity, we wanted to explore and promote diversity in all its forms by taking a step further, by extending the concept to include not only the subjects whose stories are being portrayed but also those behind the camera who tell those stories, on how we choose to represent diversity, so as to avoid perpetrating clichés and reinforcing an ideological vision.\\u201D\\u201CEllie Goldstein is a model with Down syndrome, and she was the protagonist of a digital story that we produced for Gucci Beauty with Hyde, a super-talented photographer from Photo Vogue whom I really like. He also has a disability. \\u201CIf there\\u2019s one thing I\\u2019m proud of, it\\u2019s the work I've done toward the representation of people with disabilities. I always thought about how kids must feel \\u2014 growing up and never seeing yourself. Not in an advertisement, not in movies. There\\u2019s a complete lack of people with disability representation \\u2014 or, when it\\u2019s done, it mostly falls into the trap of presenting their subjects as brave, pitiable, or some mix of the two. \\u201CThis image is a symbol of my commitment. It went viral, the image and the story, and Ellie is now a model who works a lot. I am so happy about this. If there\\u2019s one thing I\\u2019m very proud of and I want to keep doing, it\\u2019s work like this.\\u201D\\u201CIn this year\\u2019s Photo Vogue Festival, we did two exhibitions: One was called All in This Together, and the other one was called In the Picture, with four young artists, whom I really, really love. The artists were Nadine Ijewere, Ruth Ossai, Camila Falquez, and Alexandra von Fuerst. Going back to the idea that every image is political, we wanted to explore what this means when we speak about fashion. I think that these four artists are contemporary socially conscious fashion photographers. Their work is imbued with issues of gender, race, and womanhood, without ever being didactic or redundant. It\\u2019s instead very glamorous, vibrant, and powerful. \\u201CThey are four artists working in an industry \\u2014 fashion \\u2014 that is undergoing a profound journey of self-reflection, and they are not mere bystanders observing the change but rather part of the main driving force. \\u201CI think Ruth\\u2019s work is extremely important. As she says, when she grew up she thought that fashion photography was inaccessible and untouchable. In her words, it can also be the everyday and imperfect, while filling her subjects with power and agency. It\\u2019s not that fashion has to be for a certain type of person, class, or demographic.\\u201D"},{"author":"Stephanie K.

On Monday, the 21-year-old rapper's \\\"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\\\" debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, just over a week after he released the highly anticipated song and music video. It's his second No. 1 single after he rocketed to fame with \\\"Old Town Road,\\\" which led the charts for 19 weeks in 2019. Lil Nas X reacted to the news on Twitter, reflecting on the last two years \\u2014 and the people who dismissed him as a one-hit wonder. \\\"y'all told a 19 year old who had just escaped the lowest point of his life that he would never have a hit again. you told him to stop while he's ahead,\\\" the rapper wrote. \\\"he could've gave up. but 4 multi platinum songs and 2 #1's later, he's still here.\\\"He followed up with a few more lighthearted tweets.And a really sweet video he made in 2020 to his future self. \\\"Congratulations,\\\" a younger Lil Nas X says to himself. \\\"You deserve all the good shit that's happening to you right now.\\\"When he released \\\"Montero,\\\" which is the rapper's legal name, he posted a note to his 14-year-old self, who had not yet come out as gay, saying that he hoped the song would \\\"open the doors for many other queer people to simply exist.\\\" \\\"you see this is very scary for me, people will be angry, they will say i'm pushing an agenda,\\\" he wrote. \\\"but the truth is, i am. the agenda to make people stay the fuck out of other people's lives and stop dictating who they should be.\\\" Since its release, the \\\"Montero\\\" music video has drawn criticism from some, including conservative politicians, for its satanic imagery and explicit sexual undertones, to which Lil Nas X has had no shortage of responses. After landing on the top of the charts on Monday, he had a particular message to the haters: \\\"i want your tears to fill my grammy cup.\\\""},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Young Adult LGBTQ+ Books Spring 2021","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/rachelstrolle\/spring-2021-young-adult-lgbtq-books","content":"The Darkness Outside Us by Eliot Schrefer These Feathered Flames by Alexandra Overy  Speak for Yourself by Lana Wood Johnson The Love Story of Ivy K.

In awe, lasciviously, curiously. Instinctively, she knew when eyes were drawing across her, trying to figure out what they could from her figure. Chin slightly raised, arms and legs lean and athletic, and wide hips that swayed and exuded a femininity so innate it refused to be contained; to some it was a call they felt they had to respond to, to others, a declarative statement of power, something to fear, revere. As a competitive swimmer at Ifá Academy, she had an intrinsic allure that followed her as she flew into the air before diving into the pool. Prizewinning, majestic, her limbs flew through chemicalized water as if it were the sea and she were the current itself. The energy itself. The gravity from the moon itself. She transformed the pool into a sun-dappled lake. Though she moved with incisive swiftness, she made her preternatural ability look breezy. It was casual magnificence. She pushed and pulled as if she were conjuring power from the water. Those who watched often mused that it seemed as if the water only existed to propel her. Ọṣun was accustomed to being a spectacle, people observing her in wonder, trying to surmise what they could from what they saw. Which was why she hid as much as she could, and kept as much of herself to herself as she could. Swimming was her sanctuary, it was just a shame that it necessitated an audience. During swim meets she paid no attention to the roar from the bleachers or the superfluous commands from her coach (the coach was decorative, a symbol that represented the school\\u2019s power over Ọṣun\\u2019s triumphs, as if Ọṣun hadn\\u2019t made a dry basin bloom into a lake by dancing in it at 3 years old). In those swim meets, she focused on the sound of the water smacking against her skin like a hand against the taut hide of a talking drum. Her swimming became a dance to a rhythm she was creating with the water. With each hip switch a hand sliced through the water till she was no longer just a body among bodies within a false aquatic body, tiled and sterile. No, she was the body, the only body, vibrant and heavy breathing. By the time the music stopped, she was over the finish line, alone. All they saw was an excellent athlete; only she knew that she was a dancer. Ọṣun was used to being looked at and ignoring it. Most people would say that, when they looked in the water, they saw themselves, but what they really saw was their reflection, light bounced back. A reflection was just the water rejecting an unwelcome intrusion. Water was generous, but mostly it wanted to be left alone. Come in if you want, drink if you want, but don\\u2019t peer in without engaging. However, when Ọṣun\\u2019s gaze met the waves, she really saw herself. Her hair was soft, dark, and roiling, with thick coils swelling around her face like a towering tide. Her face held deep, striking eyes that tilted inward slightly, as if too heavy to stay steady. They carried too much, they carried the whole universe, and were fathomless like the ocean. Her skin was as deep and smooth as a vast lake, its sparkling surface harboring an unfathomable depth beneath, a whole world beneath. The water beckoned her in as kin. She was a highborn: unknowable, untouchable, and unable to be contained. One could enjoy but never possess. Experience but not capture.But Ọṣun felt captured by the gaze on her now. It was all-consuming and sank through her skin. She detected the most tucked away parts of her stirring, being drawn to the surface. She didn\\u2019t know the source of it but she felt it. She was sitting on a large hide-skin mat at the academy\\u2019s celebration of the iteration of the Ojude Oba Festival with a loose smattering of people who liked to call themselves her friends, drinking palm wine from coconut cups, her lips glistening with fried sweet-bread oil, observing the festivities. The air swelled with laughter, music, the scent of fried plantain, roasted meat, and spiced rice. Ebony horses in colorful leather swayed, their manes entwined with red, yellow, and green ribbons, and were led into the parade by the academy\\u2019s jockeys, who matched their steeds\\u2019 majesty with brightly dyed, flowing agbadas and fila. They directed their horses through elaborate routines with elegance and expertise, despite their heavy, cumbersome outfits. Talking drums were having loud conversations, orchestrated by the Tellers, the elite drumming league of the academy, who learned and recorded history through music. They spread news, provided entertainment, and bantered through verse. Their chests were bare, gleaming, and their arms were tense as they slapped and tapped the hide-skin with both palm and stick, alternating in notes and somehow gleaning harmony from each strike. Students were dancing to the tale of their town\\u2019s origin, to love stories told through cadence, laughing, waists rotating, and feet blowing up red dust as they pounded. They celebrated the gods and goddesses who comprised their alumni, those who had ascended to the highest of heights. All throughout the merriment, Ọṣun felt that look searing across her skin, making her heartbeat quicken so it syncopated with the sound of the drums. Part of the reason Ọṣun didn\\u2019t know who was looking at her was practicality. She couldn\\u2019t turn to see. Her neck was secured under the firm, sinewy arm of Ṣàngó, student chief elect of Ifá Academy, captain sportsplayer (of all the sports), captain girlplayer (of all the girls), with a charm as ferocious as his temper and gray eyes that lightened and darkened according to his mood. It was a known fact within the academy and within the county that Ọṣun was the only one who could calm him when he thundered over some perceived disrespect or when someone dared to question his innate authority. Ọṣun was the only person who saw Ṣàngó\\u2019s eyes slide from slate to silver close up. She would walk into the midst of a brewing fight, the crowd parting way for her, and lay a hand across his tense jaw and look up at him. Murderous fire would turn to amorous flame, angry gusts of air into soft billowing breath. She would take his hand and lead him out of his own chaos. All of Ṣàngó\\u2019s girls didn\\u2019t matter, because Ọṣun knew she was all of them put together, and more. They were just iterations of her, splintered into lesser forms. There was a smiley girl who lived a few compounds away from Ṣàngó whom he liked to spend time with. Ọṣun didn\\u2019t mind this. Ọṣun knew that, when she smiled \\u2014 rare, but it happened \\u2014 it was as bright and as intense as the sun at noon. It could intoxicate those around her into such euphoria that, when the high ebbed, they felt like they were plummeting into the depth of all the despairs of the world, compounded. Ọṣun didn\\u2019t know what would happen if she laughed. She never did. Then there was the girl whom Ọṣun had constellation observation class with. Ṣàngó often visited her after festivities, loosened with palm wine. She was a girl who acted as if she hadn\\u2019t drunk since the moment she was born, and whose thirst could only be satiated by Ṣàngó\\u2019s sweat on her tongue. Ọṣun didn\\u2019t mind that either. Ọṣun knew that, when they were together, Ṣàngó drowned in her, died and came back to life in her, and that when their hips rolled together, it was stormy waves: almighty, thrilling, terrifying. She knew she tasted like honey and liquor and that she left him both satiated and insatiable, tipsy, and all at her whim. Ọṣun knew that she was all Ṣàngó ever wanted and more. She knew it was the More that terrified him. The surplus taunted him. She knew that sometimes having everything you desire can make you question your own worthiness. Ṣàngó didn\\u2019t like the taste of his own insecurities. He never liked to wonder whether he was Enough to match her Too Much, so he had to seek balance with diluted derivations of her. She was fine with all of this until the week before, six days before the Ojude Oba Festival, at her sister Yemọja\\u2019s Earth Journey celebration. The party was thrown at their compound, and Ọṣun had ventured out into the surrounding forest for a break. She admired her sister, who\\u2019d ascended from the school a year ago, but she often found her presence overbearing. When Yemọja laughed, it sounded like waves crashing against the shore, and often Ọṣun felt like the craggy cliff walls the waves cuffed against and eroded. The two sisters had the same face poured into different forms. Ọṣun felt her sister was a more sophisticated version of her. Yemọja was taller and lither, whereas Ọṣun was shorter and curvier, defying the prototypical mold for athleticism. Yemọja was an expert sailor, often leading teams of 40 or 50 vessels on voyages of exploration. She had mastered the waters so that she needn\\u2019t ever submerge. Ọṣun felt weak for needing to feel the ebbs against her skin. Yemọja highlighted what Ọṣun lacked, and though Ọṣun loved her sister and her sister loved her back, she couldn\\u2019t help but feel lesser around her. People hung on to Yemọja\\u2019s every word and Ọṣun watched them do it, saw them use those words to hoist themselves up spiritually, charmed and bolstered by Yemọja\\u2019s presence. Seeing this, Ọṣun had tried to strike up conversation at that party, in a valiant attempt to emulate her sister\\u2019s charisma, but she found that, when she spoke to people, they watched intently as her lips moved, their eyes following how her mouth shaped words, rather than listening. So Ọṣun left the teeming party and went for a walk through the forest, aiming for the river, a place where she felt peace. It was a surprise when, through the thicket by the riverbed, she saw the broad, muscular shoulder of Ṣàngó, who, a mere 30 minutes earlier, had wrapped a thick arm around Ọṣun\\u2019s waist, pulled her to him, and whispered that she was his love and that it pained him that he had to socialize when all he wanted was to be with her, but that he needed to collect more ale from the seller with a few of his men. Now that arm was around someone else. Through branches that seemed to cower in embarrassment, Ọṣun saw that Ṣàngó\\u2019s neck was bent as he whispered something into that Someone Else\\u2019s ear before kissing it.He then said, louder, \\u201CỌṣun doesn\\u2019t like to dance. I miss dancing. Dance with me.\\u201D He moved slightly to reveal Ọba: Ṣàngó\\u2019s former lover-friend, pre-Ọṣun, her baby-round eyes soft and stupid, small pretty flower mouth, waist moving with smooth respectful reverence as Ṣàngó called to her with his hips, jutting in response to the beat of the faraway drums. The way her waist moved was polite and coy, technically rhythmic but with no fire of its own. Even in dancing, she was bowing for Ṣàngó. Ọṣun rolled her eyes. This, Ọṣun hadn\\u2019t been fine with. Ọba was meek and irritatingly sweet, a sweetness that Ọṣun found cloying. Even after Ọṣun had successfully captured Ṣàngó\\u2019s attention, Ọba had been kind to Ọṣun, insisting she held no ill feeling, that all she ever wished was for Ṣàngó to be happy. Ọṣun had found this exceedingly pathetic and would have had more respect for the girl if she had sworn a vendetta, if she had told her to her face \\u2014 like a warrior \\u2014 that she would not be letting him go. However, Ọba\\u2019s involvement was not what struck Ọṣun so hard in her chest that she almost stumbled back. It was Ṣàngó\\u2019s words. It was a lie. Ọṣun loved to dance. She and Yemọja danced by the seashore every night at sunset, drumbeats rising from the ocean for them, their laughter melding with the roar of the tide. Ọṣun danced every time she was in the water. She thought that Ṣàngó, at least, saw that. Through everything, the one thing that kept her tethered to Ṣàngó was that he saw her. They saw each other. Sometimes, not often, but sometimes, when she was with Ṣàngó, she felt close to how she felt when she was in the water. She realized now that this was an illusion. Sometimes, when you are hungry enough, you can will the ghost-taste of sweet-bread in your mouth. It will make you hungrier, though, and emptier. And sometimes you won\\u2019t know how truly bereft of food you are until it\\u2019s too late. After a few moments, Ọba saw Ọṣun through the branches and froze. Ṣàngó followed Ọba\\u2019s gaze, saw Ọṣun too, his eyes flashing in alarm, a bolt across his face. Ọṣun observed his eyes slide from silver to slate. He stepped forward, Ọṣun raised a hand. Ọba looked sorry for Ọṣun, which made Ọṣun feel sick to her stomach. So Ọṣun smiled, wide and beautiful, dazzling and terrible. It made Ṣàngó call on the rain clouds for anchor, and the sky turned gray. It made Ọba feel like she was submerged in the river behind her, unable to breathe, to see, to speak. Then Ọṣun turned around and returned to the party as if nothing had happened. After that day, Ọba found that the ear that Ṣàngó had whispered in felt like water had plugged it. Try as she might, nothing would pour out. Herbalists couldn\\u2019t fix it, priests feared it. It forever felt as if she were half submerged in the river. From that day on, Ṣàngó was too terrified to speak to Ọba ever again and didn\\u2019t dare visit his other girls. For reasons Ọṣun could not confess to anyone, not even herself, she stayed. Ṣàngó still never asked Ọṣun to dance. He was talking to his boys now, palm wine sloshing out of his cup. Ọṣun rolled her eyes. Ṣàngó loved an audience, adored holding court, regaling them all with stories from sports tournaments, from the places he visited and sought to conquer when he ascended the academy. His people laughed on cue, a chorus in a call-and-response tale, unable to display anything but sycophantic joy as Ṣàngó told of how, once, a market man refused to sell a lion-skin cape to him. The man had told him the cape was for men with honor, and that he hadn\\u2019t seen enough in Ṣàngó to sell it to him. \\u201CI told him I would rule over him one day. Old fool said that he knew. He said that he hoped that I would accrue enough honor for the lion skin, that my back would become broad enough for it. Can you imagine? A whole me. A whole me who can carry an ox on his back? Two oxen! I thought he must have surely been joking.\\u201D Ṣàngó spat into the earth as his eyes melted into something darker than slate at the memory. \\u201CSo I laughed in his face.\\u201D With Ṣàngó\\u2019s angry laughter came thunder, and with thunder came lightning. \\u201CThe only problem was that now the lion skin was stained with ash. Dyed with idiot.\\u201D His court roared with jest. Ọṣun felt ill. She shrugged Ṣàngó\\u2019s arm off her neck, feigning that she was readjusting the multicolored beads that hung around her throat. The feeling of being watched grew more intense. She turned around, and through the heated dancing bodies, she saw a tall, lithe, muscular figure, leaning against a tree. His arms looked like branches twined to make a trunk, and so it almost seemed as if he were mocking the fever tree\\u2019s strength. He was eating a rose apple, white teeth sinking into membrane and then flesh, playful eyes never leaving Ọṣun\\u2019s. His left ear glinted with a silver crescent cuffed into his lobe and it matched the flash in his eyes. It was different from the light she saw in Ṣàngó\\u2019s eyes, which was entirely indicative of himself, his whims. Ṣàngó\\u2019s eyes flashed lightning when he was in the mood to drown in her, but he never asked her if he ever made her catch fire. This man\\u2019s eyes were calling her, pressing through her. He was seeing into her and he wasn\\u2019t bowing. He had three striking scars across his muscular chest, on the left side, welts she immediately wanted to run her fingers across. He smiled at her as if he knew. She turned back around, alarmed. She pinched her sister next to her and drew her away from the conversation she was engaged in. Yemọja was Ọṣun\\u2019s closest friend, in that she was her only friend, bound by blood and bonded through water. \\u201CTurn around slowly, like you\\u2019re looking for someone. Do you know who the tall new boy is?\\u201D Ọṣun said \\u201Cboy\\u201D to calm herself, to allow herself to feel some semblance of control over this man whose gaze was making carefully compacted parts of her stretch and bloom into their fullness. Yemọja blinked twice, thrice, startled that Ọṣun was talking to her casually about things that regular sisters talked about casually. Yemọja\\u2019s baby sister was extraordinarily beautiful, and extraordinarily, beautifully strange. Once, when they were on the benches in the school field, watching Ṣàngó and his boys defeat another county, Ọṣun\\u2019s eyes had glazed over and she\\u2019d said, \\u201CDid you know that thunderstorms don\\u2019t always produce rain? It\\u2019s a shame, because the rivers hear the thunder and see the lightning and expect to be filled up, only to end up disappointed. Dry thunderstorms are just show-offs. Scaring birds and burning trees while the river pants. Forgetting that the river helps feed the clouds that thunderstorms are created from.\\u201D Her eyes never left the sports field as she spoke. Soon after, Ṣàngó scored the winning goal. Yemọja rarely knew what Ọṣun was talking about. She often nodded and smiled when Ọṣun uttered things like this, knowing that anything she replied would only ever make Ọṣun\\u2019s eyes shadow in impatience, would cause her to retreat quickly again, when her cerebral soulfulness wasn\\u2019t matched. Yemọja was of the ocean as Ọṣun was of the river, but Yemọja was earthy, practical, tethered to the things of this world, tied to the unanointed peoples, so she could relate to them, mother them. Her younger sister had the freedom to stay connected to the heavens, to allow her psyche to dwell outside this realm. Yemọja was the root and Ọṣun was the blossom, forever reaching for the sky. And so Yemọja pretended to understand what Ọṣun was saying and Ọṣun pretended that she was understood. It was a sweet kindness they shared that benefited them both. But Yemọja understood Ọṣun clearly now and was pleased. Ọṣun needed more than Ṣàngó. Ṣàngó would rather make himself feel bigger with women less powerful than Ọṣun instead of elevating himself. Yemọja did as she was told \\u2014 turned around casually \\u2014 and when she turned back to Ọṣun, her smile was gleeful. \\u201CAh. That\\u2019s Erinlẹ. He is joining the academy next season. He won the country-wide competition for a spot and was invited to this festival as an early introduction.\\u201D They had shifted away from Ṣàngó and his boys \\u2014 not that it mattered. They wouldn\\u2019t have been able to hear the sisters speaking over the sound of their own voices and the giggling girls surrounding them anyway. Ọṣun nodded and sipped at her palm wine. Yemọja smiled wider. Ọṣun barely drank. \\u201CWhat won him a place here?\\u201D Their academy was selective, a training campus for the gifted. One was either born into it, being of celestial heritage, high blood (Ọṣun, Yemọja, and Ṣàngó), while others were scouted for their particular skill, sourced through tales of power and often mysticism throughout the counties. They were known as the earthborn; of the rooted realm. \\u201CHunting, my heart,\\u201D Yemọja said, allowing herself the indulgence of using an intimate term of endearment. To Yemọja\\u2019s pleasure, Ọṣun didn\\u2019t flinch. Ọṣun nodded and poured more wine into both their bronze cups from a gourd. \\u201CSo he\\u2019s an earthborn.\\u201D Yemọja shrugged. \\u201CAburo mi, it means nothing. We are all equal here. Those who are supposedly highborn often act like they were born beneath ground.\\u201D Yemọja sidled her eyes to where Ṣàngó was sat, tipsily jeering, and Ọṣun bit into her smile.Yemọja continued, shuffling closer to Ọṣun, so their shoulders were touching. If strangers saw them, they might have presumed that they\\u2019d always been this way, companions, confidantes, sisters by blood and friends by choice, that they sat between each other\\u2019s knees and braided each other\\u2019s hair while gossiping as ritual. \\u201CHe is a master bowman. Farmer too. It\\u2019s said he can bring crops to life with a touch. Good with his hands.\\u201D She shot a knowing, playful look at Ọṣun, and to Yemọja\\u2019s surprise, Ọṣun allowed herself a tiny fraction of a smile. It made Yemọja feel like she\\u2019d won something and she felt bolstered to continue. \\u201CIt\\u2019s said that the scars on his chest are from when he fought a lion. They say the lion wanted to eat his heart for his strength.\\u201D Ọṣun took a sip of her wine. \\u201COr the lion wanted to eat his heart because it was a lion.\\u201D To Ọṣun\\u2019s surprise, Yemọja released her ocean roar of a laugh; it bubbled out of her. People didn\\u2019t often laugh around her. Did she say something funny? She wasn\\u2019t aware, but she found she liked the feeling of being enjoyed for what she freely gave. \\u201CWell, Erinlẹ won. Clearly. As you can see.\\u201D Ọṣun looked up and saw that Erinlẹ was now in front of her, in the middle of the courtyard, a talking drum leaning against his taut torso and his arm, joining in with the music. Her eyes dropped and she realized that, around his waist, was a wide strip of tanned sandy hide over his deep rust-hued woven cloth. Lion skin. Erinlẹ was smiling as he made the talking drum sing, joining in easily with the Tellers. The Tellers were notoriously unwelcoming to newcomers, an elite band of expert musicians who came from expert musicians. But here they were, folding him in, and Erinlẹ not only matched them, he made them better. Now that he was closer, she could examine him more. His skin was a deep reddish brown, the exact tone of the earth by the riverbed at her favorite place to swim. \\u201CMay I speak with you?\\u201D She heard a low, cool voice that she somehow knew belonged to Erinlẹ, and yet his mouth didn\\u2019t open. His eyes were trained on her intently. She held still. Ọṣun was very sure that he had spoken without speaking. \\u201CIt seems that you\\u2019ve already allowed yourself that honor,\\u201D Ọṣun dared to think, playing with the notion that he might hear her. From the broadening of his smile and the light in his eyes, it was clear that he had. \\u201CNo. I was just knocking. Testing. Seeing. We both know that, if you didn\\u2019t want me to speak with you, I wouldn\\u2019t be here.\\u201D Ọṣun could see now that time had stopped \\u2014 or at least it had been suspended. The red earth and deep green of the forest melted into a thick smog. Ṣàngó\\u2019s laughter sounded as if it had been submerged in water, and her sister\\u2019s warmth had ebbed away. Everybody was a blur. The festival was occurring in slow motion, as if it were a dream. She found that she was now standing opposite Erinlẹ, inches away from him, close enough to reach out and touch the ridges of his scars if she were so inclined. Ọṣun forced her eyes away from his chest and directed them plainly into his. \\u201CWhy would I want you in my mind? I don\\u2019t know you.\\u201D Erinlẹ\\u2019s gaze made Ọṣun\\u2019s blood blaze beneath her skin. \\u201CI don\\u2019t know you, but you\\u2019ve been in my mind. I guess just not in the same way. Not in this literal sense.\\u201D Ọṣun tried to swallow her curiosity (she wasn\\u2019t used to the taste, as she rarely found what men said to be interesting), but it rose back up to push a question from her lips. \\u201CIn which sense, then?\\u201D \\u201CIn the sense of a young man wondering about the woman who would one day hold his heart.\\u201D Ọṣun found it in her to roll her eyes, to conjure the semblance of dismissal, despite the fact that every cell in her body thrummed with the knowledge that this man wasn\\u2019t speaking with regular flat flattery \\u2014 this was not an attraction tethered to how her being in his possession would make him feel. He spoke plainly of her power over him, and he didn\\u2019t cower, didn\\u2019t puff up his chest to overcompensate. \\u201CAnd how do you know that\\u2019s me?\\u201D Erinlẹ shrugged in a matter-of-fact manner. \\u201CHow do crows know when an earthquake is about to happen?\\u201D Ọṣun raised a brow. \\u201CSo, you sensed your destruction?\\u201D Erinle laughed, eyes glinting. \\u201CI sensed my world about to shift.\\u201D Ọṣun\\u2019s heartbeat was steady at all times, but now it was frantic, hectic, at odds with the stillness surrounding them. Ọṣun cleared her already clear throat. \\u201CSo, is this your power? Summoning people out of the world and meeting them in their own?\\u201D Erinlẹ stepped closer to her. \\u201CIt\\u2019s your power. You called me here. I am earthborn \\u2014 my gifts were blessed to me. But I read that sometimes this can happen when two energies find something in one another that compels them to each other.\\u201D \\u201CAnd what about you should compel me?\\u201D Aside from his smile, his warmth, and the fact that she felt herself unfurling around him. \\u201CI don\\u2019t need anybody.\\u201DErinlẹ laughed and nodded. \\u201CI am aware. It\\u2019s not about need, but desire.\\u201D Ọṣun swallowed. \\u201CWhat I desire is to know why a strange boy was staring at me from afar. I want to know what made him lose himself to be so bold as to look at Ṣàngó\\u2019s beloved so openly.\\u201D Erinlẹ shrugged. \\u201CI didn\\u2019t lose myself, I found myself. Whether or not you are Ṣàngó\\u2019s beloved is of no consequence to me. You are not his possession. It\\u2019s a lie he believes to make himself feel better about himself. I wasn\\u2019t looking at Ṣàngó\\u2019s beloved, I was looking at you.\\u201D Ọṣun held still for a moment and regarded him, feeling something swell within her. Something visceral, that pushed her to carry through with her inclination to allow a finger to sweep against the lines across his skin, transgressing the lines she drew for herself, rules that disallowed anyone to see her innermost desires. As she touched the scars left by a jealous beast, the long-healed and -sealed gashes shimmered beneath her touch, glowing bright and amber. Erinlẹ watched her, his eyes veered from playful to serious as he reached to tilt her chin so that her gaze met his, unabashedly, nakedly. \\u201CWhat do you want, Ọṣun?\\u201D Ọṣun opened her mouth but found that her words got stuck. Want. Ọṣun hadn\\u2019t wanted in a long time. She was obliged to hone her gifts. Obliged to represent the academy. In many ways, she felt obliged to be with Ṣàngó, representing the highest of the highborn, but Ọṣun couldn\\u2019t remember the last time someone asked her what she actually wanted. People sought to touch without acknowledging her desire to be caressed, to consume without realizing her craving to just be held. They looked but never saw. Erinlẹ looked at her intently, as if he was seeing her More. He smiled and it rippled sunlight through her. \\u201CỌṣun, oh, Ọṣun . . .\\u201D Ọṣun froze. Was he singing? His mouth was moving, and he seemed to be starting a chorus with her name, beating the drum, looking her in the eye. The world rushed back into sharp focus, the sound flooding back into Ọṣun\\u2019s ears with almost painful clarity, just in time for her to hear Ṣàngó\\u2019s conversation draw to a complete halt. \\u201CDid he just say your name?\\u201D Ṣàngó\\u2019s voice was incredulous. \\u201CYes. He did,\\u201D Yemọja responded smugly, on the opposite side of Ọṣun, as Ọṣun forced herself to quickly acclimatize to the world around her. Her conversation with Erinlẹ hadn\\u2019t been more than a split second in the temporal sphere, but her whole body felt more alive than it ever had, everything around her seemed more vivid, clearer. Ọṣun felt more of herself brought forth to the rooted realm. She felt more of herself in general. Erinlẹ\\u2019s singing was a bold move. Nobody sang but the Tellers. To sing you had to be elected by them or appeal to them in front of an audience. Nobody sang directly to others unless they were friends teasing each other, friends congratulating each other, or if they were initiating courtship. It was more than being able to hold a note: One had to be able to draw song on the spot, it could not be precomposed. It\\u2019s how you knew it was from the heart, and it had to be from the heart. Ṣàngó had never sung to her. Ṣàngó had never sung to anyone. He prided himself on never having to. Ọṣun could hear Ṣàngó beginning to thunder next to her and she turned to him, allowed her eyes to be as fathomless as possible. \\u201CBe still.\\u201D Ṣàngó\\u2019s jaw tightened, but she felt the rolling of his thunder subside immediately. Whether he liked it or not, Ọṣun had his heart in her palm. She scared him. The whole festival had now turned to pay attention to the spectacle, Erinlẹ\\u2019s small hooked cane beating an intricate, delicate tune that seemed to conjure up the image of Ọṣun. It rolled like the gentle ebbs of a river, it sounded sweet and fierce and plush. Erinlẹ was walking slowly up to her, drum slung across his torso, gripped under his arm as tightly as his eyes gripped on to hers. \\u201CỌṣun, may I borrow you, I will kill a thousand lions for your dowry, Scale mountains to pluck the stars for your wedding jewels, Slap the clouds to make them cry so your rivers will always overflow.\\u201D Ọṣun laughed. That was what she wanted to do. She wanted to laugh. To allow all the parts of her she tucked away to flow freely. To escape the trappings of expectation. To be. People gawked. No one had ever heard her laugh before. Ṣàngó had never heard her laugh before. It sounded like birdsong and the laps of a river. Erinlẹ was beckoning her, looking directly into her eyes. The timbre of his voice made her blood thrum and the hairs on her skin stand up. Ọṣun suddenly felt lifted, as if she were swimming. The drumbeats felt like waves crashing against her skin, beckoning her as kin. \\u201CStand tall, my queen. I would give you the universe but how Can I gift you to you? So I will give you my heart, strong and true, I cannot conjure thunder, but I will plant a forest for you, sow flowers that bloom In your presence, fruit that tastes like your essence.\\u201D It was supposed to be bawdy \\u2014 these songs usually were. However, the way he sang caused electrical currents to course through Ọṣun\\u2019s body in a different way from when she was with Ṣàngó. These currents depended on her; it was as if his energy caught fire through contact with her. She had to agree to it for it to blaze. Erinlẹ was now in front of her. \\u201CỌṣun, oh, Ọṣun, My beat is calling your waist, Won\\u2019t you answer? Won\\u2019t you answer? You look like a woman who loves to dance.\\u201D Ọṣun got up, legs unfolding easily beneath her as the clouds above rolled. She paid no attention to Ṣàngó. She followed Erinlẹ to the middle of the courtyard and allowed her hips to switch with the beat, her arms to sway through the air, laughing as she did so, as Erinlẹ bent low with his drum and dipped and rose as she moved, responding when she called with her waist. There was thunder, but Erinlẹ\\u2019s drum rose above it, interlaced with Ọṣun\\u2019s laugh. There was lightning, but Ọṣun\\u2019s smile outshone it. Ọṣun was used to being looked at, but, from this moment, she would become used to being seen. ●From LOVE IN COLOR: Mythical Tales from Around the World, Retold by Bolu Babalola.

The following books, new and forthcoming, explore the natural world, reckon with humanity in an environmental context, and chronicle the many aspects of life on earth.Cephalopods are a molluscan class of sea creature characterized by, among other things, bilateral symmetry. Kathryn Smith\\u2019s poems embrace a kind of lyrical symmetry alongside the fragmentation of loss \\u2014 loss of ecology, loss of attention, loss of hope. The poems here don\\u2019t shy away from a sense of doom, but neither do they succumb to it; they cling to a love that propels us forward, no matter how imperfectly.

Chagas are one such parasite, carried in \\u201Ckissing bugs,\\u201D which are found in Latin America and the US. Daisy Hernández, whose A Cup of Water Under My Bed is one of the great contemporary memoirs, lost her aunt to the \\u201Ckissing bug disease\\u201D in the 1980s. In her thirties, she decided to learn more about this rare illness, and uncovered a whole world of systemic inequities and deliberate policies that keep it hidden from public consciousness. This is a gripping and lyrical work of nonfiction that says a lot about how people, specifically white Western colonizers, interact with the more frightening aspects of nature.

I was 2, the youngest in our neighborhood, and so in our block-wide productions I was given the part best suited for my abilities. I don\\u2019t remember playing the actual role, only the review \\u2014 that I could never stay still, the one skill the part required. The neighborhood plays were conceived of and written by my older sister. She has always only ever wanted to be a writer, and she pursued that dream with a steadfastness that meant she was a playwright by her early twenties. It was always a given that my sister would fulfill her dream \\u2014 I only ever saw her persevering, never any struggle. When she was in college and I was in middle school, she staged her first productions, and I remember going to them with the supreme sense of the inevitable: that this was what she would always and should always be doing. I had the same fierce desire to write, but not the certainty. It seemed that making a living out of your words and imagination was too good to be true \\u2014 a fabulous existence that would always be just out of reach. I read widely about writers\\u2019 lives, and they all, to a person, seemed to revel in pain and alienation. As someone who had had enough of that before the age of 14, I wasn\\u2019t sure I wanted to sign up for a job where people judged the depth of your excellence by how deeply you had suffered. I had accepted that my childhood and adolescence would be full of suffering, but I was not prepared to have it continue into the self-willed space of adulthood. The first play my sister had produced outside of college was staged in the same space where I had done children\\u2019s theater \\u2014 an old abandoned middle school that our town was halfheartedly attempting to turn into an arts space. In fifth grade, I had acted there, in my last year of unself-consciousness. I had gamely played the part of a saloon girl in a spaghetti Western parody that the children\\u2019s theater put on. My best friend and I were both cast, and I remember the best part about being in the play was that I got to wear a blush-colored dress with puffed sleeves \\u2014 what I considered to be the height of beauty and sophistication then. My sister\\u2019s play came my sophomore year of high school. In the intervening years between that elementary school production and my sister\\u2019s, though, I had grown a kind of artistic consciousness, or at least a vague understanding that how I saw myself and my own body in the world differed drastically from how everyone else saw it. Nowadays, I have the words for what I was experiencing: misogynoir; fatphobia; colorism. But then, it was only the distinct feeling of wishing to disappear, because the body I inhabited suddenly seemed to draw commentary from anyone and everyone around me.I had never, before, given much thought to my body \\u2014 it was merely something that moved me around. But in sixth grade, I began to gain weight, and in seventh, a not very good psychiatrist put me on a high dose of an antidepressant that caused me to gain even more in a short period of time. Suddenly, my body did not make sense to the people I saw every day, even some of the people who claimed to love me. I remember going to get my hair braided at my cousin\\u2019s house and her saying, as I settled on to the pillow she\\u2019d placed on the floor so she could reach my head, \\u201CYou wear dresses that short? I\\u2019m scared of you.\\u201D Before that moment, it had not occurred to me what length my dress was, but I instantly understood \\u2014 I had grown too fat for the skirt to go past my knees, and the extra inch of skin above them was somehow a threat. My body was a topic of conversation to all, the understanding being that it was fundamentally wrong, a problem to be solved, one that could be figured out if I just thought about it long enough. It took a long time for my ambitions to catch up with my body. Like all adolescents, I was still making and remaking myself. In middle school, I still thought that maybe I would be an actor. My mother dutifully signed me up for more children\\u2019s theater workshops, which eventually resulted, in eighth grade, in being invited to audition for the role of Dorothy in a regional production of The Wizard of Oz. I remember the audition very well \\u2014 being instructed to pretend to sneak from one end of the stage to the other and furtively pick up a book. Halfway across the stage, miming the movements of discretion, I suddenly felt more in my body than I ever had, and with a shock I realized how embarrassing this all was. My movements were not natural but in the wholesale quotation marks of someone who was deeply self-conscious. I was not good at this. I was a terrible actor. With this new self-consciousness came a silencing that extended into my daily life, a literal one. At home, I was still vicious and sharp-tongued \\u2014 I still earned my childhood nickname of Surly. But in public, I could rarely speak. It felt, at the time, as if I had swallowed a large, round, smooth stone from the bottom of a clear cool river, and the rock sat at the bottom of my throat, preventing any sound from coming out. I often longed to speak \\u2014 I wanted to speak \\u2014 but I could not get a sound around that stone, no matter how hard I tried. Perhaps the most disorienting thing about the mutism was that few people seemed to notice it. In my small private high school, where I was one of very few Black students, it was easier for everyone around me if I didn\\u2019t speak. The few times I was able to push out sentences in class, I remember them usually being met with a long, awkward silence before the conversation continued, and another student, ten minutes later, repeated what I had just said as if my words were their own. Being mute was a kind of burning indignation, one that I tried to fight against every day, but very few people outside my family expected me to have a voice at all. A few years after this revelation, the spring of my sophomore year, my sister had her first production. It was a semi-autobiographical piece about a single mother and her daughter and the discussions they have over a series of car rides. My sister had written one of the daughters as a preteen, and they were having trouble finding an actor to play her, so somehow, either the director or the producer volunteered me for the part. It was a supremely disorienting experience for me, a person whose whole life was beginning to be defined by dissociation, to inhabit my sister\\u2019s imagined version of me for a paying audience. The role was needling and bratty, a classic younger sister, an archetype that came with that designation; she had a few good one-liners. My sister had written the role to be charming, and because she is a good writer, it worked. Audiences liked it. I remember only applause. The play had a short run \\u2014 three days, I think \\u2014 and on the final day of production, the director approached my sister to ask her if I might want to act in another production. This woman\\u2019s friend was mounting a production of Ed Bullins\\u2019 satire of Blaxploitation Dr. Geechee and the Blood Junkies, a play which most of the Black actors in Boston were unofficially boycotting. The play is a kind of allegory for the crack epidemic \\u2014 a long-form exploration of the metaphor of addict as violent zombie. It takes elements of Shaft and parodies of \\u201990s media like CourtTV and movie announcements to form a pastiche of criticism of mainstream media representations of addiction and race. This is a very generous read of the play. It was a production that found great humor in the idea of a southern sheriff fighting a vampire \\u2014 that was the whole joke. The director was a white man in his sixties. His stage manager was a Latina woman in her early twenties. The rest of the cast seemed impossibly grown-up but, looking back, they were all probably in their mid to late twenties as well. The director was scrambling to fill roles \\u2014 the actor playing the part I was offered had walked off set and refused to participate. I was the youngest cast member, still in high school, and I was offered the part not because I was good but because I was young enough not to ask any questions. As a 15-year-old and in violent, silent internal revolt of everything around me, I told myself that I hated Boston, that I wanted to leave the city and the state as soon as I was able. I knew that when I did, it would have to be of my own volition \\u2014 my mother was a single parent, only a few years out of grad school herself, and even if she had had the funds to bankroll an escape, her principles would never allow her to do so. With such a huge desire to escape, the only way out seemed to be college in another state. But I was not, for a long time, a good student. A chronic procrastinator, it never really occurred to me to finish my homework on a regular basis. My sophomore year I had turned things around and begun to get A\\u2019s, but I was keenly aware that when I applied to schools I would have a string of terrible semesters to explain. I was also interminably shy and hated to do activities, so I was on the lookout for extracurriculars that could fool an admissions board into thinking I was a team player.So it was partly my own cravenness that led me to agree to do the play, despite knowing about the boycott, but it was also the adults in the production \\u2014 mostly white \\u2014 who spoke of the boycott as a frivolous thing, a case of Black artists being too sensitive and not understanding nuance, that thing that everyone calls for whenever anyone calls something, rightly, racist. In my memory, Bullins only came to a few rehearsals, and I only knew him as a great and respected writer, which is what everyone told me. Wikipedia did not exist then, so I had no way to know about the abuse allegations brought against him by his former wife, the womanist poet Pat Parker, who once said that she \\u201Cwas scared to death of him.\\u201D I only knew that these older artists had deemed it silly, anti-artist, almost, to question the work we were putting on. I did not know yet that I could question why these white producers and white director were so eager to put on this particular play. Because the cast was already deep into rehearsals, they had all hyperbonded, in that way only actors can, weeks before I arrived. The part the woman had found too demeaning to play was that of a sex worker who gets bitten by the star blood junkie and then goes into a writhing transformation onstage, a grotesque parody of an orgasm that ends in the character becoming a zombie herself. I don\\u2019t remember if I read for the part before I played it, if I even read the script \\u2014 I must have, but I did not register what it would ask of me. For this part, I had to first enter the stage in a skimpy costume, then proposition the lead actor. From there, he\\u2019d indicate that he would pay me for sex, reach over, pull me into an embrace, and sink his teeth into my neck. I had never even held hands with another person, let alone kissed anybody, and I was acutely aware that this was the most physical contact I had ever received from someone who was not in my family or a doctor. It was mortifying. To compound the humiliation, the costumer gave up on trying to find an outfit for me and told me I should dress myself. This was in the mid-\\u201990s, when plus-size fashion was either large, shapeless sacks or overalls. Back then, I mostly wore overalls. I knew what I was supposed to wear to suggest that I was a streetwalking zombie, but I also knew that no store sold those types of clothes in my size. And on top of all this \\u2014 I was still not fully living in my body, then. I hovered above it most days, wounded by its continuous mortifications. And though I was able to speak in my initial interview with the director, I was not able to keep up the facade with anyone else. I slunk into rehearsals and sat on the bleacher seats and stayed quiet, hoping none of these people would ever notice me. The production was to be held in a unitarian church in town \\u2014 a big, drafty building with a color-blocked mural on the front dedicated to racial unity. We rehearsed at night, in the middle of a Boston winter, so the church was always dark and drafty; I remember mostly the hazy lighting, the wind whistling through the eaves, how the whole wooden structure groaned in the cold. Even though I had been warned that others found the play offensive, I still wished, after my first conversation with the director, to be part of it. I had told myself that if I got this role, I would be able to be a more interesting, less strange and damaged version of myself. In my head, I made up an elaborate fantasy of what else would fall into place in my life if I got the role \\u2014 I\\u2019d bump into my crush on my way to and from the theater, and he would find my double life as an actor with artists so much older than me so alluring and we would quickly start dating and everyone would finally begin to recognize me as the artist I knew I could be. I told this story to myself over and over again so many times that I began to almost think it was real, and it was a disappointment each evening when I arrived for the start of rehearsal and I didn\\u2019t see the boy I liked \\u2014 though I knew he didn\\u2019t live anywhere near the theater and in fact I probably would never see him at all. In that fantasy, though, I was able to go back to take control of some sort of role-playing, since the one I had on the stage had gotten away from me. Every time the lead actor grabbed me by the shoulders and made to bite my neck, I flinched and froze and my whole body went stiff. I tried to will myself not to. I tried to think myself out of that response, but my stubborn body wouldn\\u2019t listen. But I couldn\\u2019t help it \\u2014 he made me want to recoil into myself, and that was all I could convey on stage. The director was getting increasingly frustrated. First, he sent the stage manager over to talk with me. I had wished on so many occasions that she would be my friend, but I thought of her as so much older than me, and I saw the omnipresent clipboard she carried as a sign of her own supreme competence. Her body would never betray her, I told myself. It was probably perfectly in line with her mind. She took me to a dark corner of the church and tried to give me some advice. \\u201CJust relax,\\u201D she said. \\u201CGet used to the cast. Hang out with people. Talk with people. It will be fine.\\u201D At that point in my life, the concept of relaxation was a foreign one. I was so silent outside of my house that most people chose to read muted panic as tranquil calm. At home, no one ever relaxed. Ease was a state to be distrusted, repose was rigorously questioned. If ever I was to stop moving, not actively go about the house tidying or reading or some other virtuous activity, my mother would ask, \\u201CAre you depressed?\\u201D Which, it was clear I was, but any desire to stop and wallow in it was pathologized. The key was to be depressed but keep it moving \\u2014 perhaps the motion would carry you to a calmer state.So when she said \\u201Crelax,\\u201D I did not know how to respond. Eventually, they called over one of the actors to give me deep breathing lessons. We stood in the church secretary's office, which had become a kind of hangout spot for the cast. Here, I would usually spend my breaks doing my homework, listening to the other actors boast to one another about how hard they had partied the weekend before. I was a very sheltered teenager, if you have not already gathered, and so I took these feeble brags at face value. The actor who gave me the breathing lessons played the town sheriff. He was scrawny and wiry, with ruffled hair, and was considerably less intimidating than the lead, who was tall and broad and movie star handsome \\u2014 Denzel Washington as a local. The actor who played the sheriff, in contrast, gave off more of a Steve Zahn vibe. The sheriff had me stand in front of him, while all around us the cast gossiped and lounged and ran lines. \\u201CPut your shoulders back,\\u201D he said. \\u201CPlant your feet on the floor. Breathe in very deeply, now out. Close your eyes.\\u201D It was another kind of humiliation, to practice breathing in front of an audience. But I willed myself to do it \\u2014 I closed my eyes and expanded my chest and let out one big whoosh. For a moment, the change in oxygen levels left my brain feeling thin and plastic, a pleasant feeling. Then I opened my eyes and noticed that the sheriff had been staring at my breasts moving the whole time. He was embarrassed to be caught and quickly turned his eyes away. We didn\\u2019t talk about what happened, and I certainly didn\\u2019t tell anybody about it. Back then, it was something to be shrugged off, another penalty of girlhood, and to tell someone about it would put me into the same category as the woman whose role I had taken over \\u2014 too outspoken, too sensitive, a word that I took as a slur. I did not want to be sensitive, because to be sensitive suggested a weakness, an irrationality that had been subtly conveyed to me about all those actors who had said no before me. I did not make the connection, then, that to be an artist, to be a writer, means that on some level you must remain sensitive to the world, to the parts of it that everyone else tells you it\\u2019s normal to respond to with a deadening. I did not know that sensitivity was necessary \\u2014 I thought it was only being messy. And I did not know that sensitivity requires a base level knowledge of yourself and its own reactions that I was incapable of cultivating. The role I had been asked to play required, after the lead bit my neck, for me to become a monster onstage. For weeks, I wasn\\u2019t able to do it \\u2014 the director would cue me to scream, to start my transformation, and I could only come out with the feeblest of squawks. But after the breathing lesson, I could do it. I erupted into a series of whoops, loud and insistent, guttural cries that I paused to echo in the theater even as I slunk backstage. At the time, I did not make the connection between all my suppressed rage and alienation and my ability to make that sound. I only was relieved that my body was finally doing something right, something that I actively wanted it to do, for once. After we opened, every night, the audience cheered at my exit \\u2014 the scream was played for laughs. I wish I could say that I felt free in the screams, or that afterward I found my voice, or that they were a source of catharsis. But it would take many more years before I learned how to scream for myself, not for a performance to please others. I think, looking back, I wanted to act because I did not know myself at all. I thought to be an artist, you had to know yourself with the same kind of rigid control used to memorize a multiplication table or a series of lines. I did not know that self-knowledge is an expansive thing, ever-changing, its fluidity part of its power. That it can only be cultivated through periods of rest and reflection, and that my body is my partner in my quest toward self-knowledge, not my opponent. But those lessons were years away. ●Kaitlyn Greenidge's debut novel, We Love You, Charlie Freeman, was one of the New York Times Critics\\u2019 Top 10 Books of 2016 and a finalist for the Center for Fiction First Novel Prize.

State prisons provide explanations that describe the books as \\u201Csexually explicit\\u201D or \\u201Ca threat to the order and security of the institution,\\u201D but their reasoning is vague and doesn\\u2019t explain why the content is considered a threat.

In June 2019, the Human Rights Defense Center published on Prison Legal News its list of disapproved publications \\u2014 including books, newsletters, magazines, and other printed materials that vary by state. Among these bans, some state prisons uphold restrictions on genuine educational resources, including how-to guides on coding and prison abolitionist newsletters. Some prisons use heavy-handed rules restricting books they claim promote \\u201Csecurity threat groups\\u201D and \\u201Csexually explicit materials\\u201D to justify prohibiting health textbooks and works by Black authors. And sometimes there is no justification: In Virginia, for example, no reasoning is provided for banning books like HTML & CSS: The Complete Reference, Fifth Edition by Thomas A. Powell, the Magic: the Gathering series, and Windows 10 in Easy Steps Special Edition, Second Edition by Mike McGrath. Based on the most recent data available, here are some of the books and resources that incarcerated people are banned from reading.Assata Shakur documents her experience in prison after being accused of killing a New Jersey state trooper. On the day of the killing, she traveled with Zayd Malik Shakur and Sundiata Acoli, both fellow members of the Black Liberation Army when State Trooper James Harper stopped them at the New Jersey Turnpike for a broken headlight. Harper was later accompanied by Trooper Werner Foerster. Both Foerster and Zayd were shot dead, and Assata and Acoli were wounded. Assata, who maintained her innocence, was convicted in 1977. She recounts her childhood and life experiences that brought her to the Black Panther Party. She escaped from prison and sought political asylum in Cuba, where she resides today. The autobiography is banned in prisons in Louisiana, South Carolina, and Arizona prisons. It recently received approval for Wisconsin prisons. Angela Davis shares her journey to understanding political activism and abolition, touching on her experience being incarcerated and the Black Panther Party.

American On The Run In Ukraine.","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/christopherm51\/craig-lang-ukraine-far-right-extremists-true-crime","content":"The staccato crack of gunfire rang out across the cloudy night, startling residents of a modest enclave in southwestern Florida. Lee County sheriff\\u2019s deputies, responding to a flood of 911 calls, raced to the area, but in the dark they were unable to find where the shooting had taken place. It wasn\\u2019t until the next morning, when employees of a nearby business complex called the Galleria discovered the crime scene. Fifty-year-old Deana Lorenzo was found slumped over in the passenger seat of a red GMC truck, shot in her head, neck, and abdomen. Serafin \\u201CDanny\\u201D Lorenzo, 52, lay supine on the bloody pavement near the vehicle\\u2019s passenger side with bullet wounds to his head and lower body. Gunmen had fired no fewer than 63 rounds in a matter of seconds. The Lorenzos never had a chance.Just 20 hours before their deaths, the Brooksville, Florida, couple, both military veterans, believed they were on the verge of a big payday. They had answered a classified ad on the website Armslist.com, hoping to score five Glocks, an Uzi, and more guns and parts. The listing said: \\u201CFor Sale: Lots Of Guns. Leaving the country soon. Looking to sale [sic] all my guns as I can\\u2019t take them with me.\\u201D The Lorenzos often made deals together, flipping houses or shopping for antiques. Serafin Lorenzo also bought and resold guns for profit, and he knew a good deal when he saw one. He wrote the seller, a man calling himself Jeremy Goldstein, to offer an Oris-brand watch or cash. Goldstein declined the watch. \\u201CI have cash on hand,\\u201D Lorenzo replied, offering to pay $3,000 for the arsenal. He added, \\u201CMine is a sure deal.\\u201D There was no Goldstein, and there would be no deal, but the Lorenzos didn\\u2019t know this. Instead, according to the FBI, Craig Lang, 30, and Alex Zwiefelhofer, 23, were lying in wait in the dark of the secluded, palm tree\\u2013lined business complex, the agreed-upon meeting point in the small Florida town of Estero. The two men had served in the US military and acquired years of specialized training before they deserted. They later traveled to Ukraine to fight in an armed conflict with right-wing extremists, grew increasingly radicalized, and returned to the US with plans to get back on a battlefield in quick order. But they needed money. All told, US court records describe a string of violent exploits, crimes, and misadventures stretching across multiple states and four continents. Experts on extremism have been following, with growing concern, the activities of mostly young far-right extremists with military backgrounds who seek out foreign wars to gain fighting experience. They\\u2019ve seen how these soldiers-for-hire get radicalized and then carry home what they learned in troubled, distant lands like Ukraine. The country has emerged as an important hub in the transnational white supremacy extremism network. Far-right extremists see the war zone there as a laboratory where they can gain actual combat experience to bring back home. For a time, Lang thrived in this murky world of violence, but an examination of his life and the crimes he is accused of committing provide a stark example of the impact of one American\\u2019s radicalization.Eastern Ukraine, an area roughly the size of West Virginia, is a land of extremes. Summers there can get hot enough to fry an egg on the street and winters cold enough to toss boiling water into the air and watch it transform into a frozen powder. Its vast steppes are blanketed in golden sunflowers and flecked by black dust from coal mines and hulking steel factories. And in the past seven years, some 4 million Ukrainians have tried to go on with their lives amid a brutal war. It was there in April 2014, two months after the Moscow-friendly Ukrainian president was overthrown by revolutionaries in Kyiv, that a Russian special forces operation took hold. Disguised as a local uprising, it exploded into an all-out war that killed more than 13,000 people over the course of seven years. With just 6,000 combat-ready troops, Ukraine\\u2019s underfunded, underequipped, and unprepared military was no match for the much more sophisticated Kremlin-backed insurgency. Dozens of volunteer paramilitary units, including hardened right-wing nationalists and neo-Nazis, leaped into the fray to halt the Russian advance. Among the most prominent: Right Sector, a group that answered to no state authority.The battalion\\u2019s commander was Dmytro Yarosh, a stocky man with stubble and a slight lisp, whose goal was to build a country for ethnic Ukrainians. An avowed follower of Stepan Bandera, a Ukrainian Nazi collaborator who fought Soviet rule in the 1930s and 1940s, Yarosh inspired and mobilized upward of 3,000 Right Sector fighters who shared his vision. Many of them boasted tattoos of swastikas, Black Suns, and other Nazi symbols, and they were often seen making the \\u201CSieg heil\\u201D salute. Human rights groups and Western governments accused them of torturing combatants and civilians, notoriety that only raised the group\\u2019s profile. Extremists began pouring into the country to join its ranks and those of other far-right paramilitary formations. Among them were roughly 40 Americans, according to interviews with seven of the men, research from experts, news reports, open-source information, and court records. Many of the Americans held far-right views and a propensity for violence, and were searching for a new beginning after a series of failures in the US. Craig Lang was one of them. Lang had joined the Army in 2008 to escape his troubled childhood in North Carolina, which included five years in a foster home, according to his father, Donald Lang. (In Ukrainian court, Craig Lang described assaulting a teacher.) Friends say Lang told them the Army was his best way out. He served in the infantry from November 2008 to June 2014, completing tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, where his Humvee struck a roadside bomb. \\u201CI was in a position, a round came in, it exploded, and caused a brain injury,\\u201D Lang would later tell the Ukrainian court. \\u201CI have problems with vision in my left eye. I often have problems with headaches.\\u201DAt the same time, his marriage was imploding. His wife, who\\u2019d been his high school sweetheart, filed for divorce. According to news reports, Lang believed she was seeing other men. In 2013, he deserted his posting at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, and drove nonstop to his wife\\u2019s home in North Carolina, with his military body armor, night vision goggles, claymore mines, and two assault rifles in tow. He wanted to kill his wife, he later told a journalist. \\u201CCraig went frickin\\u2019 ballistic,\\u201D one Army colleague told me. Lang\\u2019s wife was not harmed. Police had been alerted to his unsanctioned trip and arrested him at his father\\u2019s home. Donald Lang told a local news channel that his son had \\u201Cdeveloped PTSD\\u201D since returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. He was jailed for several weeks after the incident and then returned to El Paso. On June 4, 2014, he was dishonorably discharged from the Army. A spokesperson declined to comment on the terms of the discharge (or to confirm his injuries), but it cost Lang his veterans benefits, health insurance, and gun license. On top of that, his wife finalized the divorce, took possession of his truck and home, filed a restraining order against him, and won custody of their child. In seeking the restraining order, his wife wrote: \\u201CI fear for my safety and the safety of my two-and-a-half-year-old. Craig has demonstrated violent behavior directed towards me and others on many occasions.\\u201D She said he had previously tried to suffocate her with a pillow in front of their toddler, threatened to kill her, and sent her a text message about trying to kill himself. After being discharged from the Army, he struggled to find work, taking odd jobs that often only lasted for weeks at a time, friends of Lang\\u2019s told me. In 2015, mired in debt and without any lucrative prospects, he came across an article about the war in Ukraine. It described the Ukrainian military\\u2019s struggle to hold back the bigger and stronger Russian army, and the foreign fighters streaming into the country to fight with far-right volunteer battalions. He arrived in Ukraine in May 2015, seeking adventure and violence.Lang said he was barely off the train in the war-torn region of eastern Ukraine when a member of Right Sector handed him a loaded AK-47. The next morning, he was deployed to a position just a few miles from the Russia-controlled city of Donetsk, a key stronghold where some of the most intense fighting was taking place. \\u201CI personally chose Right Sector because I thought they were the most active on the front line,\\u201D Lang told BuzzFeed News. (Lang and I communicated via social media and in person on at least four occasions over two years but he always declined my requests to be interviewed. However, he did speak briefly to a Ukrainian reporter BuzzFeed News sent to cover court proceedings in March.) Without the ability to speak Russian or Ukrainian, Lang stuck close to the few English-speaking Ukrainians and a handful of other Americans and Europeans in the Right Sector. An American volunteer who fought with Lang described him, two of his closest American companions, and two Austrians as \\u201Cmaniacs\\u201D who \\u201Cgot their rocks off\\u201D firing Kalashnikov automatic rifles or the battalion\\u2019s machine gun and shoulder-fired rocket-propelled grenade launchers. The five men called their close-knit squad \\u201CTask Force Pluto\\u201D after the Greek god of the underworld. An American fighter who wasn\\u2019t part of Pluto but hung around the men told me they had a \\u201Cfetish for death and torture.\\u201D A freelance German photographer visited the Right Sector base in early 2016. One of his images shows Lang \\u2014 6 feet 2 inches tall, with a craning neck, sapphire-blue eyes, light hair, and an untamed amber beard \\u2014 holding up a photo of his daughter. In another photo of Lang, a tattoo of the words \\u201CMOLON LABE\\u201D \\u2014 an ancient Greek expression of defiance that translates to \\u201Ccome and take them,\\u201D a phrase that has been adopted by Second Amendment activists and conservatives in the US \\u2014 is visible on his right forearm as he shakes the hand of a man with the same tattoo on his arm.A third picture shows Lang beside a member of the unit who is giving a Nazi salute. American fighters who knew Lang said that between gun battles, the men of Task Force Pluto would bring up their \\u201Ctroubling\\u201D political views over cheap Ukrainian booze and cigarettes \\u2014 and that Lang\\u2019s politics and behavior grew more radical. He would often defy his commanders\\u2019 orders and attempt to provoke the enemy into a gunfight, they said. One of them said that Lang\\u2019s lack of discipline was largely why his two-month stint later as a contract soldier in Ukraine\\u2019s Armed Forces didn\\u2019t pan out. Speaking with BuzzFeed News, Lang said he didn\\u2019t \\u201Chave any extremist political views.\\u201D But Damien Rodriguez, a Bronx native who previously fought with a far-right Ukrainian unit and crossed paths with Lang on the battlefield, recalled it very differently. \\u201CSome of the things he said made me think, Dude, I don\\u2019t wanna be next to you right now,\\u201D he said. \\u201CHe was telling me about starting a revolution\\u201D in the US. \\u201CIt was crazy.\\u201D Lang, he said, wanted to \\u201Cwatch the world burn.\\u201DDavid Plaster, another American who fought in the ranks of Ukrainian volunteer battalions with Lang, said in an interview that Lang liked to boast about \\u201Cfucking people up\\u201D and doing \\u201Cextrajudicial shit\\u201D in the war zone, especially to enemy combatants captured by Right Sector. During his downtime, Lang spent hours responding to Facebook messages he received from other Americans who were hoping to fight alongside far-right extremists. Those prospects had seen him in interviews with Ukrainian and Western media. Footage of him firing a machine gun or standing beside artillery made him into a sort of folk hero among Ukrainians and wayward young men back home in the US. According to Brian Boyenger, an Iraq War veteran who served as a sniper in Ukraine from 2015 to 2016 alongside Lang in the country's Armed Forces, Lang was the first point of contact in Ukraine for many \\u201Clost boys\\u201D who came to the country to fight. Boyenger said he acted as an unofficial human resources manager of sorts, interviewing dozens of the fighters Lang had recruited. He turned many of them down, he said, for being \\u201Cradicals\\u201D or \\u201Ctoo eager\\u201D to gain real-life combat experience. One of the prospects Boyenger rejected was a South Carolina native named Jarrett William Smith, who told me in a letter that he was attracted to the neo-Nazi imagery of Ukraine\\u2019s far-right battalions and had reached out to Lang while still in high school. Smith never made it to Ukraine, although he still hopes to go there and fight someday. Instead, he enlisted in the US Army and in September 2019 found himself facing serious federal charges for allegedly helping far-right extremists. Prosecutors said he sent recipes for homemade napalm on the social networking site Telegram and discussed plans to assassinate former House representative Beto O\\u2019Rourke and blow up the offices of CNN. He later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two and a half years in prison, where he now resides. The roughly 40 Americans who are known to have gone to Ukraine range in age from their early twenties to mid-fifties, and some have ties with far-right extremist groups in the US. A few with far-left affiliations have joined Russia-backed forces. In October, I reported that Kyiv deported two American men who were tied to Atomwaffen Division and the Base, stateside neo-Nazi groups linked to violent crimes including murder and alleged plots to attack US nuclear facilities. At least one of them has since returned to the US. Ukrainian security services told me that the Americans had tried to set up a local branch and connect with members of the country\\u2019s Azov Battalion, a group of far-right radicals and neo-Nazis that has been accused of torture and war crimes. (The group is now officially a part of Ukraine\\u2019s National Guard and has been renamed the Azov Regiment.)Kacper Rekawek, a researcher at the nonprofit Counter Extremism Project and the author of a 2020 report on right-wing foreign fighters in Ukraine, told me that European intelligence agencies began taking notice years ago of extremists going to the country. Italy, Spain, Czechia, and the United Kingdom are among several countries that have arrested and prosecuted citizens who fought with groups in eastern Ukraine and returned home. \\u201CThese guys project their fantasies onto the war in Ukraine,\\u201D Rekawek said. \\u201CThey say, \\u2018We went there because we thought we could live our lives the way we want to.\\u2019 They\\u2019re like ISIS in that way.\\u201D Mollie Saltskog, a senior analyst who tracks foreign fighters at the Soufan Group, a New York\\u2013based security consultancy, worries about what happens when they leave the war. \\u201CThe question is, what do they want to do after leaving Ukraine? Some want to make more of a lateral career move and become a career mercenary \\u2014 but then the people who go back to Europe and the US, how are they using their newfound skill and newfound network?\\u201DNathan Sales, the former ambassador-at-large and coordinator for counterterrorism at the State Department, told me last summer while still in his post that the US had been monitoring reports of American white supremacist fighters in Ukraine \\u201Cvery closely.\\u201D He pointed to comments by FBI Director Christopher Wray, who said in October 2019 that his agency was watching \\u201Cracially motivated violent extremists connecting with like-minded individuals online certainly, and in some instances \\u2026 travel[ing] overseas to train.\\u201D That tracks with what four American fighters told me about their encounters with federal agents when they returned to the US. They said they were pulled aside in airports and questioned about their motivations for fighting in a foreign war, their affiliations with Ukraine\\u2019s far-right extremist groups, and their personal beliefs and ideologies. But the intervention didn\\u2019t have much effect. \\u201CThey question me: What was I doing? Blah blah blah,\\u201D one American fighter told me. \\u201CI tell them I don\\u2019t have anything to hide. Then they let me go. Every time.\\u201DBy summer 2017, when the war in Ukraine had cooled to a low simmer, Lang told other American fighters that he was growing bored of the monotony of trench warfare. Alex Zwiefelhofer, an American fighter who joined the Right Sector after deserting the US Army and connecting with Lang online, was getting restless too. According to US court documents, they hatched a plan that June: travel to East Africa to fight al-Shabaab, a jihadist terrorist organization allied with al-Qaeda. Claiming to be journalists, the two men made it only as far as the Kenya\\u2013South Sudan border before the South Sudan People\\u2019s Defence Forces reportedly detained them. They were arrested for trying to cross without proper documents and thrown in a Nairobi jail for almost two months. \\u201CSo, week six of African jail. just contracted cholera,\\u201D Zwiefelhofer complained in a July 2017 Facebook post he managed to publish from a phone he said he smuggled in. Lang\\u2019s passport was marked by US authorities with a black stamp, rendering it invalid, due to unpaid child support. Weeks later, the two of them were deported back to the US; Lang was sent to Surprise, Arizona, where his mother lived at the time. Meanwhile, Zwiefelhofer ran into more serious trouble. While Customs and Border Protection agents interrogated him at the airport in Charlotte, North Carolina, about his foreign military exploits in Ukraine and South Sudan, they discovered child sexual abuse imagery on his phone, court records show. He was booked into jail on charges of sexual exploitation of a minor before being released on bond and fleeing to Wisconsin. That case is still pending. As the months went by, Lang and Zwiefelhofer grew restless again. The pair craved the exhilaration they got from fighting overseas, their acquaintances told me. They started talking about returning to Ukraine or going to Venezuela to fight alongside anti-government rebels who were trying to overthrow socialist President Nicolás Maduro. Beginning in March 2018, they exchanged Facebook messages and hatched plans to meet in Miami, according to court records. And from there, plans for the next battlefield.After Lang and Zwiefelhofer arrived in Miami by bus on April 5, 2018, they did what many tourists who come to South Florida do: don tropical shirts and snap selfies. Inside a La Quinta Inn in Miami, nestled between a Denny\\u2019s, a Wendy\\u2019s, and a McDonald\\u2019s near the city\\u2019s international airport, Lang slipped into a button-up shirt patterned with navy and light blue hibiscus flowers. Zwiefelhofer put on a shirt adorned with yellow, pink, red, and green martini glasses. Then the pair took selfies against the purple, black, and white decor of room 210. But they didn\\u2019t pack like typical tourists. Together, they brought at least four semiautomatic Glock pistols, one high-powered rifle, and hundreds of bullets. In the weeks before, court records show, Lang and Zwiefelhofer had discussed smuggling guns and ammunition to Miami, buying body armor at a military surplus store, committing robberies, hot-wiring and stealing a yacht, and escaping to South America or Ukraine. According to the FBI, the pair said they might \\u201Ckill a yacht owner if necessary\\u201D to make their getaway. What the men did next in room 210, with the fluorescent light of fast-food signs glinting through the curtains, was like something from a Coen brothers film. After examining Lang\\u2019s laptop, the FBI found that the two men had googled \\u201Cclassified Miami handguns,\\u201D \\u201Chotwire boat ignition switch,\\u201D and \\u201Chow to smuggle myself to South America.\\u201D And then they watched a scene in a Hollywood action movie where shooters ambush passengers in a sitting vehicle. On April 7, authorities say, the men used Lang\\u2019s laptop to post a classified ad on Armslist.com under the name Jeremy Goldstein, offering to sell five Glock handguns, one Star pistol, one Uzi, and four upper and four lower receivers for AR-15 assault rifles. A little over 24 hours later, at 12:10 a.m. on April 9, 2018, Serafin Lorenzo texted with the man he believed was Goldstein to inquire about the firearms. The next evening, authorities say, Lang and Zwiefelhofer drove west in a rented Toyota Corolla on Interstate 75. Better known as Alligator Alley, the flat and unswerving 80-mile stretch of pavement cuts through the Everglades. Around 10 p.m., they arrived at the Galleria complex in Estero. Serafin Lorenzo had told a family member the night before how excited he was about the deal, saying he thought $3,000 for the haul was a steal and he could sell it all for more than twice that much, the family member told me in an interview. The family member said they expressed concern about the arrangement, telling Serafin that it didn\\u2019t sound right. The family member still recalls his reply: \\u201CThis is a legit thing. Trust me.\\u201D At 10:44 p.m., Serafin Lorenzo backed the couple\\u2019s red GMC truck into a parking spot opposite a church and sent a text to the number for Goldstein saying he and Deana Lorenzo were there. Less than 10 minutes later, the Lorenzos fell under a deadly hail of bullets. The gunmen ambushed them from the rear and passenger side; federal investigators noted how similar this was to the movie scene Lang and Zwiefelhofer had watched. Red-hot rounds pierced the victims\\u2019 bodies, penetrated the trunks of palm trees across the parking lot, and blew through office windows.According to the Lorenzo family member, Deana was known to carry a pink pistol. A law enforcement official told that relative that Deana shot at the assailants at least once. When the sheriff\\u2019s deputies arrived and cordoned off the scene the next morning, they found the Lorenzos\\u2019 bodies, a truck shot full of holes, Serafin\\u2019s cellphone and brown leather wallet, and a bill of sale for the firearms transaction he thought would take place. The $3,000 cash Serafin Lorenzo withdrew was gone. Authorities said Zwiefelhofer\\u2019s cellphone records and the rented Corolla\\u2019s GPS system showed the pair had fled the same way they had come \\u2014 through Alligator Alley, vanishing into the darkness.After the killings, Lang and Zwiefelhofer were on the run \\u2014 but not to South America as they had planned. Instead, they traveled to Washington state, where Lang sold 50 firearm magazines, approximately 550 rounds of rifle ammunition, and several rifle components \\u2014 items that the FBI said Lang had previously offered to Serafin Lorenzo \\u2014 for $1,500 at Palace Jewelry and Loan, a Seattle pawnshop, according to court documents and an extradition request for Lang. Afterward, authorities said, Lang went to North Carolina to stay with his mother and Zwiefelhofer headed home to Bloomer, Wisconsin. In August 2018, four months after the Lorenzos were killed, Lang contacted Matthew McCloud, a fellow Army veteran he knew from his time at Fort Bliss. McCloud, who described for me watching Lang shoot an AK-47 at life-size posters of then-president Barack Obama and Miley Cyrus while stationed in Texas, said that Lang first reached out to him before the Lorenzo killings. Lang convinced him to come to Miami to meet him and Zwiefelhofer and then travel abroad to fight. But McCloud got picked up for check fraud in Arkansas before he could leave for the rendezvous. Upon his release, he was able to meet up with Lang in North Carolina and pay two other men for documents that would help him and Lang establish new identities to travel overseas. The guns advertised in the Armslist post were part of the payment, McCloud told me and federal agents. He said Lang failed to get a passport because he filled out part of the application incorrectly and got \\u201Cspooked\\u201D when the worker processing the paperwork began questioning whether he was who he claimed to be. McCloud told me he flew from Atlanta to Kyiv, alone, on Sept. 17, 2018, but he didn\\u2019t like it there. Within days, he was arranging to leave and meet up with Lang, who had decided to go ahead with his plan to go to South America, even without a new passport. On Sept. 24, according to McCloud and federal authorities, Lang smudged the black stamp in his passport \\u2014 put there by US authorities when he was deported from Kenya \\u2014 and used the canceled document to cross on foot from El Paso into Juárez, Mexico. Later that day, Lang caught a flight to Mexico City. He hopped on another to Bogotá, Colombia, the following day. McCloud followed him to Bogotá on Oct. 12, announcing his arrival on Facebook with a photo of the two of them wearing matching black-and-tan outfits on a church square beneath a darkened sky. But McCloud immediately got cold feet about fighting the Venezuelan government. On Oct. 22, he crossed into Texas via Mexico and was arrested by the US Marshals Service.McCloud told investigators that he had decided to abort the plan because he \\u201Cdid not want to kill people.\\u201D In custody, he turned against Lang. He informed FBI agents that Lang had told him that he and Zwiefelhofer had killed the Lorenzos and that they \\u201Cunloaded both of their clips into the dude\\u2019s red truck.\\u201D McCloud also told the FBI that Lang had boasted about killing a \\u201Cboat captain\\u201D \\u2014 who was supposed to take him and Zwiefelhofer from Miami to South America \\u2014 in a conflict over money. Local and federal authorities declined to answer my questions about that alleged killing. And I wasn\\u2019t able to find a killing in the Miami area matching McCloud\\u2019s description. McCloud, who later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit passport fraud, described Lang to me as someone struggling with \\u201Cdemons.\\u201D He said in an interview that he feared for his safety after cooperating in the case against Lang. \\u201CHe has done so many good things in all aspects of life,\\u201D McCloud said. \\u201CHe is also very troubled because of war. It caused him to do some very unspeakable things. He confided in me some very gruesome details. I can\\u2019t really elaborate on what I know for legal and safety reasons.\\u201D Lang, for reasons that are still unexplained, never made it to Venezuela either. Instead, he headed back to Ukraine.Zwiefelhofer, meanwhile, was enjoying his freedom back in Bloomer, where he lived with his father. \\u201CFeeling cute, might join and ultra nationalist militia or make the army times later, idk,\\u201D reads a photo he posted on Instagram on April 14, 2019, which shows him wearing reflective sunglasses and shooting earmuffs with a pistol in his hand at what appears to be a gun range. \\u201CIts just a meme guys I swear,\\u201D he wrote in the caption. Little did he know, federal authorities were on his trail. Weeks earlier, Zwiefelhofer, who still had outstanding charges against him related to child sex abuse materials, had filled out a form with false information while trying to buy a gun, the FBI said. Law enforcement officers swooped in and arrested him on May 23.A search of his home led to a breakthrough in the Lorenzo case when agents discovered Lang\\u2019s laptop. A book draft titled \\u201CCraig\\u2019s life,\\u201D which included passages about fighting in Ukraine, was saved on the computer. In the document, agents found further evidence that they would use against Lang and Zwiefelhofer in Florida. Zwiefelhofer voluntarily agreed to speak to federal agents, according to a US extradition request for Lang. He admitted he was in Florida when the Lorenzos were killed and had planned to travel from Miami to Venezuela and fight the government there. He also said Lang was with him in Florida. But Zwiefelhofer denied setting up the Armslist ad \\u2014 even though it was tied to an email he used and its associated Facebook page, which featured a profile photo of him in the La Quinta Inn hotel room in Miami. He also said he never traveled to the Galleria complex in Estero. Zwiefelhofer has pleaded not guilty to murdering the Lorenzos; through his lawyer, D. Todd Doss, Zwiefelhofer declined a request for an interview. Prosecutors have argued that Zwiefelhofer poses a serious flight risk and danger to the community, and he remains in custody, awaiting a June 1 trial date in Fort Myers, Florida. Prosecutors for the US Attorney\\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Florida have suggested they will seek the death penalty for both Zwiefelhofer and Lang.In Kyiv \\u2014 mindful of Zwiefelhofer\\u2019s arrest, which he had read about online, and a ramped-up effort by US authorities to track him down \\u2014 Lang got busy putting down roots and starting a new life. He was, he would later tell a Kyiv court, hoping to gain Ukrainian citizenship. While working as a freelance English-language tutor, he met Anna Osipovich, an English-speaking Ukrainian to whom he quickly became engaged. In interviews in September and October 2019, Osipovich told me that Lang rarely spoke with her about his past and wasn\\u2019t specific when he did. She said Lang told her he had no part in the Florida killings. She also said the two wanted to get married because she was pregnant. But in order to marry, Lang needed a fresh stamp in his passport; he had stayed in Ukraine long past the 90 days Americans are allowed without a visa. So in August 2019, he left the country for a short trip to Moldova. Upon Lang\\u2019s return, an Interpol notice was triggered that said he was wanted by the US on charges of murder in Florida, and Ukrainian authorities detained him. After more than a month in a detention center, he was released on his own recognizance. He could not leave the country, since his passport was being held by Ukrainian authorities, but he was free to continue his life in Kyiv. That\\u2019s where I found Lang earlier this year, on Feb. 23, along with Osipovich, who had recently given birth to the couple\\u2019s baby boy. They had come to Kyiv\\u2019s main appeals court to continue fighting a decision by the country\\u2019s Prosecutor General\\u2019s Office to extradite Lang to Florida, where family members of the Lorenzos await closure. The family member I spoke to, who has been monitoring the extradition proceedings closely, said she doubts Lang will be returned to Florida. \\u201CI wish. I hope. But I don\\u2019t have much faith in the Ukrainian justice system,\\u201D they said through tears. \\u201CWe don\\u2019t want the death penalty; we just want him to pay.\\u201D At the courthouse, Lang declined to answer questions about his alleged role in the killings when I approached him. He avoided making eye contact by turning in circles, hiding behind his lawyers, and staring into the corner of an elevator as it climbed to the fifth floor of the courthouse.He had shaved off his beard and cut his hair into an oseledets, a hairstyle favored by Ukraine\\u2019s ancient Cossack warriors that features a long lock of hair atop an otherwise bare head. Today it\\u2019s popular among the country\\u2019s far-right nationalists. On the day of his hearing, his lock was tied up with a yellow rubber band, and he wore a face mask adorned with the red and black \\u2014 blood and soil \\u2014 colors associated with Ukrainian nationalists. Featured prominently on his coat sleeve was a patch with the number \\u201C88,\\u201D a well-documented white supremacist code for \\u201CHeil Hitler.\\u201D Lang\\u2019s case is not just a matter of extraditing an accused killer. For Ukraine, it\\u2019s an issue of what to do with a man who volunteered and risked his life to defend the country, and who could face capital punishment \\u2014 abolished in Ukraine in 2000 \\u2014 if he returns to the US.The far-right paramilitary units he fought with may be extreme in the eyes of the West, but to many Ukrainians their members are patriots whose wartime sins have been forgiven. Some foreigners who served in the units have received Ukrainian citizenship for their service. All this was in play in the courtroom, where Lang sat beside a translator and twiddled his thumbs throughout the tense hearing. Sometimes he shot a worried glance at his fiancé. Seated behind him, she texted play-by-play to someone on her phone, the case of which was a brown teddy bear. Speaking in a deep and slow North Carolina drawl, Lang proclaimed his innocence, asserted that he was a freedom fighter who believed in and volunteered to defend Ukraine\\u2019s independence. He added that he was a father and provider for his new family.He never explicitly denied killing the Lorenzos. He said he was \\u201Can asylum-seeker\\u201D and claimed \\u201Cit would violate all the UN conventions\\u201D to extradite him to Florida, where he could face the death penalty. He contended that in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol, he was being targeted by the federal government for his political beliefs. Lang went on, claiming he could be prosecuted just \\u201Cfor choosing to come to Ukraine, to fight for Ukraine.\\u201D He said the US had \\u201Crefused to give a guarantee to not prosecute\\u201D him for things he did while fighting with extremist paramilitaries. \\u201CAny separatist or Russian soldier that I have killed would be a murder charge. Understand that any soldier I may have captured would be a kidnapping charge,\\u201D he said. After a short deliberation, the lead judge explained the panel\\u2019s decision. It would put Lang\\u2019s extradition on hold and give him a hearing to determine his status as an asylum-seeker. One of Lang\\u2019s lawyers jubilantly threw his fist in the air. Down in the courthouse lobby after the decision, Lang was greeted by a dozen Right Sector members. Most were dressed in camouflage fatigues and combat boots. One wore a patch with the symbol of a Ukrainian neo-Nazi organization on his arm. The group chanted \\u201CGlory to heroes!\\u201D and other Ukrainian nationalist slogans, while some hugged Lang. But the celebration would be premature. Three weeks later, his plea for asylum was denied, and the court upheld the order to extradite him to Florida. In a last-ditch maneuver, Lang\\u2019s lawyers managed to get the European Court of Human Rights to stay his extradition until it could review the case. Another court hearing is scheduled for April 22 to determine if he could be taken back into Ukrainian custody. The question of whether he will be sent to Florida for trial remains open. Outside the courtroom in March, Lang saw a woman from the US Embassy who was monitoring the case. He shouted her down, assuming she was an FBI agent. His voice shook with rage as he said, \\u201CThere\\u2019s no such thing as justice in the United States.\\u201D ● Christopher Miller reported from Miami; Estero, Florida; and Kyiv.

I mean, haven\\u2019t we all? But it seems like the trending bar has become increasingly unhinged lately \\u2014 whether because of some shadowy curation behind the scenes or because we\\u2019re collectively seeking out ever-wilder stuff as the drudgery of pandemic isolation marches on, I have no idea. What I do know, though: Deadly Illusions is the absolute trashiest I\\u2019ve come across yet. The so-called erotic thriller (it\\u2019s neither erotic nor thrilling) debuted earlier this month and was the streamer\\u2019s most-watched movie on its opening weekend. Kristin Davis plays Mary, a bestselling novelist struggling with writer\\u2019s block who hires a nanny to keep her kids out of the way while she\\u2019s working. Grace (Greer Grammer) seems at first like a godsend, keeping house and occupying the children while Mary assembles her outline and smokes a baffling number of cigars. Mary takes a personal liking to Grace, insisting she come with her to go fancy lingerie shopping (???). Soon, Mary starts to sexually fantasize about the nanny, and then they actually start hooking up on the sly \\u2014 or do they? The further Mary delves into her book project, the less she\\u2019s able to distinguish fiction from reality. The movie, written and directed by Anna Elizabeth James, could have been cringey but campy, bad enough that it swings back around to good. The makings were there. Who wouldn\\u2019t want to see prim and proper Charlotte York transported from the Upper East Side on Sex and the City to a get it on with a younger woman in a bonkers psychosexual drama? At first, I was all in. When Grace pours a pitcher of milk into Mary\\u2019s bath, tosses in some rose petals for good measure, and starts to touch her employer beneath the water, I screamed at my television. But the more we learn about Mary and Grace\\u2019s respective mental issues \\u2014 it\\u2019s a troubling depiction of people with psychological disorders, to say the least \\u2014 the more dull and even repellent I found the whole sordid project. Deadly Illusions traffics in decades-old tropes about the murderous queer seducer who worms her way into the nuclear family and attempts to destroy it from within. Grace is a sweet, innocent schoolgirl with bows in her hair one minute, a midriff-bearing jezebel the next. Turns out \\u2014 spoiler, if you care \\u2014 that Grace\\u2019s Madonna-whore complex is due to a horribly portrayed dissociative identity disorder born of severe childhood trauma. She isn\\u2019t only coming on to Mary but also her husband Tom (Dermot Mulroney), who\\u2019s as oafishly useless at batting away her advances as he is at her eventual attempt at literally slicing him to pieces. (\\u201COne thing you should know about me, Tom, is that I\\u2019m completely insane. And I always get what I want!\\u201D)The justification for Mary\\u2019s interest in Grace is maddeningly typical. \\u201CI see so much of myself when I look at you,\\u201D she says to Grace during one of their trysts. Huh?? We\\u2019re given no real reason to believe that Grace (blonde, repressed, a would-be murderer) is anything like Mary at all. \\u201CI hope when I\\u2019m older I look as good as you,\\u201D she murmurs to Mary at another steamy juncture. Speaking for myself here, but my attraction to older women has absolutely nothing to do with my own hang-ups about aging gracefully and everything to do with the fact that older women are hot! I am so bored of lesbian romances onscreen being portrayed as little else but feminine power plays of an older and younger woman seeing reflections of their past or future selves in one another. Rather than falling in love or lust because they\\u2019re actually interested in the other person in front of them, these characters \\u2014 like so, so many before them \\u2014 are only invested in seeing (and sleeping with) versions of themselves. The symbol of the lesbian doppelgänger can be a fun and even fascinating exploration of self-identification and queer desire. But when it\\u2019s poorly and lazily deployed, it reveals a fundamental refusal to treat queer characters \\u2014 and, by extension, the real-life queer women they represent \\u2014 as fully human. To round out the movie\\u2019s offensiveness, the only Black character, Mary\\u2019s friend Elaine, gets killed near the end (Shanola Hampton, you deserve better!!!), and we\\u2019re forced to watch Grace\\u2019s former foster mother kicking a dog, her casual cruelty seemingly chalked up to her being of a lower socioeconomic class and not knowing any better. With the addition of this piece of Grace\\u2019s personal history \\u2014 she grew up abused and penniless \\u2014 we\\u2019re left to conclude that poor queers with mental issues (who are only queer, of course, because they were abused) are intent on destroying straight wealthy people\\u2019s way of life. (Grace wasn\\u2019t ever actually hired by the nanny-pairing business Mary sought for care, which infuriated her; Grace thought it might have been because she\\u2019s \\u201Cnot fancy\\u201D enough, therefore adding the fuel of class resentment to the fire.) I get pretty tired, as a critic, of pointing out -isms in pieces of popular culture. My problem isn\\u2019t just the many ways Deadly Illusions recycles insulting tropes about everyone in it who isn\\u2019t wealthy and white without bothering to explore or subvert them. My problem is that yet another badly written, badly acted piece of garbage got top billing on one of the biggest streaming platforms in the world. I\\u2019m tired of Netflix churning out optimized junk that will scandalize and titillate but mostly just waste everybody\\u2019s time. Sure, we might have more of it on hand than usual until the world fully opens up again, but my time and yours are still precious and valuable. Even for our so-bad-it's-fun watches, we deserve better than this. ●"},{"author":"Michael Blackmon","title":"Amazon\u2019s \u201CThem\u201D Isn\u2019t Worth Your Time","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/michaelblackmon\/black-twitter-was-right-them-isnt-good","content":"Last Monday, the trailer for Amazon\\u2019s new horror anthology series, Them, debuted. Almost immediately, the 10-episode season, which will premiere April 9, was met with criticism. In the two-minute trailer, traumatic clips appear in quick succession: White students make ape sounds at a young Black girl, someone places golliwog dolls across a Black family\\u2019s lawn, and a revolting minstrel character flashes a devilish smile on a black-and-white television screen. Twitter users quickly lambasted the teaser. \\u201CThese directors, writers and producers love shopping around black trauma for reactions and sales. Just one light hearted movie would do but no we\\u2019re expected to sit through this,\\u201D read one tweet. \\u201CThis is \\u2018trauma porn\\u2019 and adds a sense of dramatization, or fiction, to events black people actually experience,\\u201D read another. Though there were moments that gave me pause, I wanted to check out the show for myself. And after watching the show in its entirety, I feel confident saying that Black Twitter was right about this one. Them is a bloated series that repackages some of the worst evils ever committed to Black people in the United States for entertainment \\u2014 and it does so with little to no depth about their implications, an approach that seems to be part of an unfortunate growing trend in Hollywood. Because the series features a Black cast as its focal point, it was going to be viewed through a specific lens no matter what. But in attempting to combine real historical trauma with a metaphysical component, Them ultimately dilutes itself, relying too heavily on real-world issues that never authentically gel with the story being told. The show is definitely horror, but the only viewers who may be scared, possibly even traumatized, are Black people. Created by first-time showrunner Little Marvin and executive produced by Lena Waithe, the 1950s-set series begins with the Emorys. Henry (Ashley Thomas), Lucky (Deborah Ayorinde), Ruby (Shahadi Wright Joseph), and Gracie (Melody Hurd), are a Black family who move from North Carolina to California. In search of a better life, they settle in an all-white neighborhood located in East Compton. Within 10 days, their lives are turned upside down by paranormal forces within the new home, as well as the overt racism of their white neighbors. On its face, this seemed like an interesting premise. Immediately I thought about A Raisin in the Sun, the 1959 play by Lorraine Hansberry that ends with a Black family from Chicago\\u2019s South Side making the decision to move to an all-white neighborhood. We don\\u2019t know what happened to that family, because the play ends before the move, though you can surmise \\u2014 because of American history \\u2014 that their time was anything but pleasant. Them explores similar themes, but its execution is facile.Take the character of Betty (Alison Pill), one of the main antagonists. Betty feels threatened by the family\\u2019s presence in her once-lily-white neighborhood and employs mean-girl tactics to get all the other housewives to make the Emorys feel as unwelcome as possible. In one scene, a group of white women posts up in front of the Black family\\u2019s lawn, blasting the song \\u201CCivilization (Bongo, Bongo, Bongo),\\u201D meant to emphasize the point that the Emorys don\\u2019t belong. In another scene, the same women make crude comments about the family and lob a slew of racist remarks at them. \\u201CNiggers are actually colored people,\\u201D says one of the housewives, a pregnant woman named Nat (Abbie Cobb), making a joke about what \\u201CNAACP\\u201D stands for. \\u201CDidn\\u2019t you see how exhausted she was when they got here?\\u201D Betty says afterward, referring to Lucky, the matriarch of the Emory family. \\u201CHow can you tell if colored people look tired or not?\\u201D Nat asks.I would not expect anything more than trite and unfunny assertions from people like this. These hackneyed insults from characters modeled after garden-variety racists were par for the course during this time in American history. But the issue with Them is that it never gets more interesting than that. And a potentially thoughtful examination of the structural anti-Black racism of the housing market and its effects on Black people gets sidelined for run-of-the-mill white hate. As Soraya McDonald wrote in a piece for the Undefeated last year about the pitfalls of shows that see themselves as \\u201Cadvancing radical racial politics,\\u201D like HBO\\u2019s Lovecraft Country, the villains are essentially two-dimensional: \\u201CThe big bads in Antebellum and Lovecraft Country ... are filmic paper tigers \\u2014 standard-issue evil white people who feel too one-note to engender any emotional investment in their demise. They aren\\u2019t so much characters as a collection of tropes. Their racism seems as much a casual choice as their taste for cheap dye jobs.\\u201D That\\u2019s what viewers get with Them: a stale retelling of how race operates in the US. Although there are supernatural elements at play \\u2014 many of which were so convoluted I really did not understand what was going on \\u2014 this kind of terror takes a backseat to the explicit racism, which operates, unoriginally so, as the real horror. Henry, a WWII veteran who has PTSD, battles the inequalities of being a Black man in the workforce, simultaneously undervalued and held to a higher standard than his white colleagues. Lucky deals with insecurity about motherhood, which are exacerbated by her interactions with her white neighbor. Ruby struggles with being the only Black girl in the school, a feeling that soon devolves into self-hate, and Gracie, the youngest daughter, faces a problem most common in the horror genre: seeing specters that her parents can\\u2019t see. In several instances, the show seems to think it\\u2019s going for depth when in reality it\\u2019s just reinforcing trauma. There\\u2019s a scene of such gratuitous violence that I considered turning it off because it was the clearest indication that the show conflates Black trauma with horror. The shocking moment lazily combines two torturous events happening simultaneously. It's a cheap way of pushing the plot forward and unnecessarily dumps even more grief onto the Black family. Soon after, the white characters who commit the crimes disappear, with no explanation of their reasoning for acting in such a manner. Them is not the only new TV show or film that seemingly traffics in Black trauma. Two Distant Strangers, a forthcoming Netflix film written and directed by Travon Free, who is Black, received similar pushback when its trailer was released earlier this year. The premise is that a Black man is having the \\u201Cbest day of his life,\\u201D that soon becomes the \\u201Cworst\\u201D when he leaves a hookup and gets into an altercation with a cop. In the trailer, this is a setup for a Groundhog Day sort of vibe, where the character essentially repeats this trauma over and over. I can\\u2019t speak to Free\\u2019s film; I haven\\u2019t seen it. There\\u2019s a slightly icky feeling to the marketing, however. Because stories of police brutality are so commonplace in the news, it\\u2019s understandable that people want to make projects that speak to the moment. But it\\u2019s a delicate balance; as the trailer rollout demonstrated, it can ultimately feel like Black pain is being regurgitated for capitalistic means. \\u201CIf you watch it first I'm willing to bet you'll feel differently,\\u201D the director tweeted to someone who ragged on the trailer. \\u201CGiven that subversive storytelling can't be given away in a trailer.\\u201DIt\\u2019s a complicated conversation. Black creatives should be able to express themselves and create fulfilling work, but there should also be consideration for how images of our trauma are essentially a hot commodity right now. \\u201CI am tired. I am tired of pop-cultural artifacts that render Black people as merely Black bodies onto which the sins of this ragged country are violently mapped,\\u201D wrote critic Angelica Jade Bastién for Vulture last year after the release of Antebellum starring Janelle Monáe. \\u201CI am tired of suffering being the primary lens through which we understand Black identity. I am tired of being so hungry for Black joy and Black representation that scraps feel like a meal.\\u201D After the success of Get Out, Us, Watchmen, and the like, it\\u2019s unsurprising that networks and streaming services are salivating for the next great project that will be praised for its interrogation of race in America. However, because there simply aren\\u2019t enough Black projects to balance the bad, it stings when movies like Antebellum or shows like Them get financing. In attempting to be great art, or even just good entertainment, projects like these rely on harsh violence without any satisfying exploration of characters who endure unimaginable pain. To sprinkle in a few positives, I will say that Them stuns visually, especially the first episode. The vivid colors of mid-19th-century America really pop and draw the viewer in, and Mari-An Ceo\\u2019s costume design work is impeccable. For what it\\u2019s worth, the show is well acted, with moments of wry humor that, while rare, were certainly very much appreciated. Unfortunately, while it\\u2019s gorgeous, Them has nothing new or interesting to say. The show has already been picked up for a two-season order, so maybe the next season, which will have a different premise, will be better. But if I were you, I\\u2019d stay far away from Them. ●"},{"author":"Michael Blackmon","title":"Why Lil Nas X\u2019s Latest Music Video Feels Liberating","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/michaelblackmon\/lil-nas-x-montero-call-me-by-your-name-video","content":"I was around 12 years old when I had my first wet dream. I remember waking up in the back of my mother\\u2019s car as we made our way from Maryland back to North Carolina after a family vacation. I\\u2019ll spare you the lurid details, but while most young men entering puberty probably envision a woman while experiencing this biological phenomenon, I distinctly remember being aroused by the image of a man. This memory is not painful. For me, it\\u2019s one of those moments I think about because it is definitive proof of when I began to recognize that I was not straight, though it would be at least five full years before I would have the courage to utter that out loud to anyone. But I needed to gain a better understanding of what this meant for my life and so I consulted my mother to get her take. I recall specifically asking her about the line in the book of Leviticus in the Bible that says, \\u201CIf a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.\\u201D Was that really true, I wondered? \\u201CYeah,\\u201D my mother replied matter-of-factly. As if there were nothing else to discuss, as if this was simply just the way things were. Naturally, I looked it up for myself, and there the words were, as plain as day. Sadly, my situation is not unique. Countless queer people have had to either pull themselves out of religious indoctrination \\u2014 or figure out a way to make it work for them \\u2014 in order to live their lives as true to themselves as they can. So when I saw the video for Lil Nas X\\u2019s \\u201CMontero (Call Me By Your Name),\\u201D with its overt themes of heaven and hell, I was overjoyed to see the rapper, who is Black and gay, directly engaging with religious doctrines that have been an oppressive force in the lives of Black queer folks for generations. The video begins in the heavens, high above the clouds. \\u201CIn life we hide the parts of ourselves we don't want the world to see,\\u201D Lil Nas X says in a mystical voiceover. \\u201CWe lock them away. We tell them no. We banish them. But here we don\\u2019t. Welcome to Montero.\\u201D It\\u2019s immediately clear: This is a reinterpretation of the story of Adam and Eve. The rapper is enchanted by a snakelike creature \\u2014 played by Lil Nas X himself \\u2014 who tempts him, opening his eyes to a world he never knew existed. In another scene, he\\u2019s held captive by different versions of himself, suggesting some sort of internal struggle. There are several layers to this symbolism, as pointed out by Olga M. Segura, author of Birth of a Movement: Black Lives Matter and the Catholic Church, in an interview \\u2014 \\u201Cmasculine identity fighting society's idea of what it means to be masculine, what it means to be feminine.\\u201D The video ends with Lil Nas X ascending to the heavens (after being hit in the head with a butt plug) and subsequently descending into the pits of hell \\u2014 via a stripper pole \\u2014 to face the ultimate big baddie: the devil himself. The video is playful and deliberately provocative \\u2014 that\\u2019s the point. It is not, however, a tacit endorsement of Satanism, as some critics say. But when people feel their faith is being maligned or mischaracterized, there\\u2019s going to be chatter. Several people were upset by the Satanic imagery and overtly sexual scenes in the video; they were also disturbed by the release of the so-called Satan Shoes, Nike Air Max 97s that included blood in the soles, which Lil Nas X put out with MSCHF. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem weighed in on the shoes, saying, \\u201COur kids are being told that this kind of product is, not only okay, it's \\u2018exclusive.\\u2019 But do you know what's more exclusive? Their God-given eternal soul.\\u201DThe hate is coming from the places you would expect. Detractors have been trying to take Lil Nas X to task and failing miserably. Conservative commentator Candace Owens\\u2019 approach, unsurprisingly, lacks any nuance: \\u201CWhy has \\u2018oh, but I\\u2019m gay\\u2019 become a default excuse for immorality?\\u201D she tweeted. Kaitlin Bennett, aka \\u201Cgun girl,\\u201D levied a racist attack, saying, \\u201CDo you still see your dad?\\u201D He responded, \\u201Cyep and i might fuck yours\\u201D \\u2014 which sparked its own mini controversy on right-wing Twitter. Fellow rapper Joyner Lucas praised the rapper, tweeting, \\u201Cas a artist [Lil Nas X] is doing everything he supposed to do.\\u201D But, in a now-deleted tweet, he criticized the \\\"adult\\\" nature of the \\\"Montero\\\" video: \\u201CI think the biggest problem for me is the fact he dont understand \\u2018old town road\\u2019 is every kids anthem. Children love him for that record. They tuned in and subscribed to his channels. So with no disclaimer he just dropped some left field ish & all our kids seen it. Smh.\\u201D Lil Nas X tweeted at Lucas, pointing out the flaw in his critic\\u2019s assessment: \\u201Ci literally sing about lean & adultery in old town road. u decided to let your child listen. blame yourself.\\u201D I see more than just a stunt in Lil Nas X\\u2019s retelling of the Adam and Eve story. As an adolescent, it was difficult for me to square the fact that I had feelings for men \\u2014 feelings that I was told were not acceptable \\u2014 and yet I had been put in this predicament by the omniscient being who created me. How is it a sin to be gay if God created us all? I thought. If I have free will, why does it matter if I like men? Isn\\u2019t it my choice? None of the answers given to me by my mother or any of the other elders in my family were satisfying. I wish I had known then that this condemnation of queerness was a fear-based tactic, something used to control people in order to get them to behave in a certain manner. That\\u2019s why watching Lil Nas X don thigh-high boots while sliding down a pole, walking into Satan\\u2019s lair, and falling into his lap feels so subversive. Imagery of the devil is powerful, especially for queer children who have been told that hell is the fate they will meet, burning for all eternity in the company of this being. While a lot of the discourse around the video has been about bothered parents blasting its content, what\\u2019s truly groundbreaking about it is that Lil Nas X rejects the heaven and hell binary altogether. As Louis Virtel, who cohosts the podcast Keep It!, pointed out, \\u201CThe queerest thing about the Lil Nas X video isn't the going to hell, it's the rejection of heaven's invitation.\\u201D Lil Nas X\\u2019s approach signals confronting one's fears head-on while crafting a new narrative, one that rejects the good versus evil dichotomy in favor of a story that works for you. In the end, he slays the devil, making it very clear that the point is to live your life \\u2014 on your own terms. \\u201CMontero\\u201D has more than 36 million views and counting. For the better part of the weekend, Lil Nas X has handily dealt with folks from the right who are purportedly upset. His direct approach to critics' taunts is impressive. \\u201Cy\\u2019all saying a gay nigga twerking on a cgi satan is the end of times like slavery and the holocaust didn\\u2019t happen,\\u201D he tweeted last Friday, when the video debuted. In the few years that he\\u2019s been building his name and brand, Lil Nas X has been a disrupter, a provocateur. Though his hit \\u201COld Town Road\\u201D holds the record for the song with the most ever weeks at No. 1 and toppled Mariah Carey\\u2019s nearly 25-year reign, it was originally dismissed for not being country enough. He\\u2019s been an underdog from the moment he set foot in the industry, which is why it feels like something is actually at stake when he does push boundaries. His decision to publicly say he is gay, making him one of the few Black men in hip-hop who are out and proud, couldn\\u2019t have been easy. And he\\u2019s said as much, telling the world he thought it would be something he would take to the grave. The personal has obviously influenced his art, which is what gives his work depth. If conservatives believe they will win this fight by furiously typing bad-faith arguments to Lil Nas X, they\\u2019re wrong. \\u201Ci thought y\\u2019all didn\\u2019t like political correctness. what happened?\\u201D Lil Nas X tweeted, trolling incensed people on the far right. (As a teen, Lil Nas X was one of the Barbz, the name by which Nicki Minaj fans are called, and they are some of the fiercest \\u2014 oftentimes abusive \\u2014 people to get into an internet debate with.)And honestly, what moral ground does someone like Owens, who still supports Donald Trump, have to stand on? How can a woman who is apparently so frustrated by the idea of \\u201Ccancel culture\\u201D want to attack a young Black gay man for something that essentially boils down to artistic creativity? Spoiler: It\\u2019s because these people don\\u2019t actually care about morality. If they did, they would condemn immorality even when it wasn\\u2019t politically convenient. It\\u2019s just another talking point until the next faux controversy, like the mind-numbing Dr. Seuss discussion from earlier this month. \\u201CWhen you traumatize a whole generation (and more) of kids with the concept of a literal hell (something Jesus never preached) don\\u2019t be surprised if they grow up, realize it was a control technique and then use the imagery to make a point in their art,\\u201D wrote empowerment coach Ashley Easter, in a tweet that went viral. The stir Lil Nas X caused will soon pass, but I am encouraged by the fact that he seems to have learned a lesson that took me several years to get, and even longer to put into practice: knowing when to tune out other people\\u2019s opinions about what\\u2019s \\u201Cright.\\u201D When you\\u2019re consumed by the fear that you\\u2019ll burn in flames, it changes how you navigate life. You start relationships late, you feel shame for even having the feelings that you do, and then, if you\\u2019re lucky \\u2014 which not everyone is \\u2014 you somehow make it through. It took me until I was well into my late twenties to feel fully secure about my sexuality, stripping myself of the heaviness of religious indoctrination, so it\\u2019s heartening to see a young Black queer man like Lil Nas X unapologetically take up space and forge a path forward for himself. The \\u201CMontero\\u201D video \\u2014 Montero, by the way, is the rapper\\u2019s actual government name \\u2014 is a clear sign that old, oppressive stories no longer have a hold on him. It quite literally demonstrates the power of imagining new futures and possibilities for oneself. And because of his boldness, the next generation of Black queer youth may realize that they have the power to conquer their own devils too. ●"},{"author":"Scaachi Koul","title":"Beverly Cleary And Ramona Gave Pests Like Me Hope","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/scaachikoul\/remembering-beverly-cleary-ramona-pest","content":"I came out of the womb annoying and that was that. My brother was 12 years older than me, my cousins 15 years older, and my parents had not exactly been planning on having another baby in their forties. I was short and clumsy and loud, quick to anger and ready to cry over any personal grievance, real or perceived. I had a bowl cut when what I wanted was a Shirley Temple perm. Younger sisters were supposed to be delicate peonies always learning from those who knew better, but I, for better or worse, was a little asshole. I may have been a jerk, but I was a literate one, desperate to see a fellow monster in print. Even when little girls in literature were considered scrappy, they were rarely as plainly unpleasant as me. I didn\\u2019t want an underdog you could root for; I wanted to live vicariously through an unrepentant nightmare of a human being. There are very, very few books written for little assholes \\u2014 except, maybe, the Harry Potter series, if only for the pedantic fanbase it has created \\u2014 but there is almost no art for jerks with underdeveloped prefrontal cortexes, and very few books dedicated to helping little kids harness their own bad behavior. But then there was Ramona Quimby, arguably Beverly Cleary\\u2019s most famous creation. Last Thursday, Cleary died at 104. She wrote more than 40 books before her retirement and sold more than 91 million copies worldwide. Her books were beloved by kids everywhere; they perfectly captured what it was like to be little and klutzy and excited (though sometimes apprehensive) about the big, strange world. The Ramona series was my favorite. I loved every single book about this capricious goof, but nothing spoke to me quite like the second one, Ramona the Pest, which came out more than 20 years before I was even born. In the book, Ramona starts kindergarten, becomes infatuated with her new teacher, learns how to write Q\\u2019s the cool way by turning them into little cats, and just can\\u2019t stop pulling her classmate Susan\\u2019s curly hair. Ramona felt like a perfect character, written and designed for me and only me: a tempestuous protagonist with a perennially annoyed older sibling, stick-straight hair that made me obsessed with the boing-boing of a curled lock, an unusual name, and a strong desire to kiss someone, aggressively.\\u201CRamona did not think she was a pest,\\u201D writes Cleary. \\u201CNo matter what others said, she never thought she was a pest. The people who called her a pest were always bigger and so they could be unfair.\\u201D Rarely has a book for children so perfectly encapsulated what it feels like to actually be a child: You\\u2019re always too small yet too much, too loud and too foolish, too irritating and too irresponsible. No one trusts that your feelings are real or worth hearing, and so you have to deliver them in the loudest way possible. Ramona the Pest is like a manual for how to get big, tedious adults to listen to you when you\\u2019re the smallest and least powerful person in the room. \\u201CIf she had to, she would make a great big noisy fuss,\\u201D Cleary writes, \\u201Cand when Ramona made a great big noisy fuss, she usually got her way.\\u201D After hearing about Cleary\\u2019s death, I spent the weekend rereading Ramona the Pest. My 1982 copy is worn out after being passed down to different children in the family. I think it originally belonged to a cousin\\u2019s cousin, who found Ramona obnoxious and hard to identify with. I\\u2019ve read the book so many times that the spine feels brittle, and I\\u2019ve memorized most of Ramona\\u2019s lines, especially the one where she calls herself \\u201Cthe baddest witch\\u201D on Halloween. But my favorite part of the book was always an illustration of Ramona following Henry Huggins, the arrogant traffic guard, her foot poised to step on the back of his heel and a big Grinchlike smile on her face. \\u201CRamona,\\u201D Cleary writes, \\u201Cfelt that her day was off to a good start.\\u201D There weren\\u2019t \\u2014 and still aren\\u2019t \\u2014 a lot of books about irritable little brown girls with sharp tongues, bad attitudes, and short attention spans, but Ramona the Pest was remarkably close. The best part of reading a Ramona Quimby book was that she kind of knew she was the worst. Ramona didn\\u2019t think she was a pest, but she knew how and when to change her behavior; she just didn\\u2019t want to. She wasn\\u2019t a character in the throes of self-improvement, or a child learning hard lessons about what it takes to grow up. \\u201CRamona wanted to be wicked,\\u201D Cleary writes, \\u201Creally wicked.\\u201D It wasn\\u2019t just adults who thought Ramona was a pest. Other children did too, a good reminder for the rest of my life: Some people will never do the work to understand who you really are. She apologized infrequently and only when forced to. It wasn\\u2019t necessarily that she was a pest; she just desperately needed to be heard and valued in whatever way possible.I can\\u2019t imagine Cleary would be entirely on board with my assessment of Ramona as a little asshole or my extrapolation that being a jerk is, actually, good. But she did understand Ramona\\u2019s universal appeal to children. \\u201CShe does not learn to be a better girl,\\u201D Cleary said in a 2014 interview. \\u201CI was so annoyed with the books in my childhood because children always learned to be better children, and in my experience, they didn\\u2019t. ... Her intentions are good, but she has a lot of imagination, and things sometimes don\\u2019t turn out the way she had expected.\\u201D When I was a child, there were countless forces extolling the virtues of kindness, generosity of spirit, and a softer, nicer attitude. Matilda told me I could be rescued from unread brutes if only a kindly teacher adopted me. Madeline\\u2019s fetishization of standing in straight lines at school just made me hate the French. I also distinctly remember my mother bringing home a book about a little girl trying to become more comfortable with her body, which was actually a parable about how eating disorders are very effective. So many of the books I read either implied it would require extraordinary circumstances to change my life or that I would have to warp and somehow become better. But Ramona was perfect. She was awful. If I met her today, I would indeed find her insufferable, but boy, would I admire her gumption. I wanted to be a good kid when I was little. I wanted to be a Susan \\u2014 nicely coiffed, ideally blonde, polite, diminutive, precious. I never had it in me. Cleary\\u2019s books showed me that better than being a Susan was being a Ramona: always the main character, always the funniest, always right. Inevitably, I grew up to be an asshole adult. I have known endless Susans in my life and have settled in the comfortable knowledge that I will never be one. No one thinks it\\u2019s cute when I draw my Q\\u2019s as cats, but I don\\u2019t care. I\\u2019ve never improved from my pestilent childhood self, but I\\u2019m also not interested in that kind of refinement. Last weekend, I ran into a friend and told him how sad I was about Cleary\\u2019s death, feeling a bit like Ramona had left with her. \\u201CAre you going to write about how Ramona was the blueprint for your entire life?\\u201D he asked, laughing like a real Henry Huggins. \\u201CYes,\\u201D I said, smiling, thinking about how an adult Ramona would crush the back of this jabroni\\u2019s sneaker under her toe or sharply pull his hair, how she would make sure he never forgot this minor trespass. \\u201CIt\\u2019s what she would\\u2019ve wanted.\\u201D ●"},{"author":"Shannon Keating","title":"If The Pandemic Has Made You Anxious About Returning To \u201CNormal,\u201D You\u2019re Not Alone","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/shannonkeating\/post-pandemic-anxiety","content":"Could the pandemic really be loosening its grip on us? This month, the majority of US states eased lockdown restrictions, rendering them living laboratories as the Biden administration races to vaccinate the country. We\\u2019re not nearly close enough to herd immunity to justify, say, maskless partying on spring break. But so far, roughly 1 in 4 Americans has received at least their first dose, inspiring widespread elation and relief. Long-separated loved ones are planning joyous reunions, and long-delayed plans are chugging forward at last. Still, what should be a thrilling prospect \\u2014 a return to some sort of \\u201Cnormalcy\\u201D \\u2014 has left countless people reeling with anxiety and dread. Dozens of respondents to a BuzzFeed News survey about post-pandemic life expressed excitement about that return \\u2014 traveling, hugging, seeing family again, an end to mass illness and death \\u2014 but also a slew of concerns. A 23-year-old X-ray technologist who asked to be identified as Mazzy is looking forward to reuniting with friends and taking a romantic trip if ever the pandemic ends. But \\u201CI'm worried that people will stop taking precautions before it's safe to do so,\\u201D Mazzy said. \\u201CI already have had patients that want to take off their masks during their exams, because [they say] \\u2018Aren't you already vaccinated? You can\\u2019t get sick!\\u2019\\u201D Dispelling that misinformation gets exhausting. \\u201CEven though I'm vaccinated, I could still carry the virus, which scares me because my boyfriend is in a high-risk category and I just started seeing my parents again,\\u201D Mazzy explained. \\u201CPeople need to listen to exactly what the experts are saying, and not take advantage of frontline workers.\\u201D\\u201CI'm scared that we might be living in a COVID loop indefinitely,\\u201D said Lisa Russell, 62, a substitute teacher in North Carolina. She\\u2019s worried that the virus won\\u2019t get \\u201Cunder control in other parts of the world, where people will continue to suffer and die.\\u201D \\u201CI'm really worried that [the pandemic] won't end, that something even worse will happen,\\u201D said Emily, a 32-year-old customer service representative from Illinois and one of several respondents who asked we withhold their last name. \\u201CI'm so scared that this is the beginning of a series of collapses.\\u201D Consortium experts at Harvard are cautiously optimistic that vaccines can get us to herd immunity despite the concerning rise in coronavirus variants. But that will require an estimated 70% to 85% of the country to eventually be inoculated against the virus, and according to a recent AP-NORC poll, a full third of Americans are skeptical of taking the vaccine. \\u201CI don't think there\\u2019ll be a \\u2018new normal\\u2019 without the virus entirely, especially when so many people in the USA are anti-vax,\\u201D said Amy Gijsbers van Wijk, a 28-year-old playwright who lives in New York City. If the US does get a good handle on stopping the spread, millions of workers who\\u2019ve spent the last year working from home might have to return to the office \\u2014 a possibility that dozens of the 172 survey respondents noted with dismay. Hannah Merchant, a curatorial assistant at a museum in Boston, dreads resuming her daily commute. Before the pandemic, the 36-year-old used to spend at least three hours a day on trains and subways. \\u201CIt was completely mentally and physically draining,\\u201D she said. \\u201CSince we started working from home, I can sleep two hours later each day. My husband and I are both in better moods without our commutes and have enjoyed the extra time together.\\u201D Kris Kelley Majors, a photographer from Philadelphia, also reported improved marital satisfaction after her husband\\u2019s demanding job shifted to remote work. Without his commute, \\u201Cwe have been able to spend more time together, and he has been able to help with the housework,\\u201D she said. \\u201CThere is no word yet when he and his colleagues will return to the office, but I am scared. We have become so used to having more time together, and splitting the household chores was so needed. When all of that goes away, I am not sure how we will handle it.\\u201DThe worldwide shift to remote work hasn\\u2019t only improved the lives of commuters and their families: \\u201CThe pandemic has mainstreamed tons of new accessibility technology that I, along with thousands of other disabled people, have benefitted from,\\u201D said Lillie Calman, 24. \\u201CIn college, it was an exhausting and expensive fight for classroom accommodations which are now just standard for remote learning \\u2026 While the technology has quite a ways to go, it's let me begin a graduate program that I otherwise wouldn't have dreamed of applying to.\\u201D If in-person interaction becomes the standard again, Calman\\u2019s worried that continuing to work, learn, and socialize primarily online will be stigmatized. And some people don\\u2019t want to return to work as they once knew it at all. \\u201CWhy on earth am I spending all my time either at work or thinking about it?\\u201D said a 25-year-old researcher from the tristate area who asked to be identified as KB. \\u201CIt sure as shit doesn't think about me. As cliche as it sounds, I realized [during the pandemic] that I care so much more about seeing my family, working on my hobbies, etc., than I do about a career. I've definitely reevaluated what success means to me.\\u201D \\u201CI'm worried about losing my new lease on life,\\u201D said Jane, a 26-year-old digital strategist from Louisiana. \\u201CBefore the pandemic, I lived in a stressful city and dealt with a competitive work environment. I got so caught up in the rat race and trying to get ahead that I was burning myself out. After my office went remote, I decided to go back to my hometown. This has allowed me to spend time with family and reflect on what's important to me in life. I realized so many things I was chasing are pretty meaningless. I worry that when I return to the office and competitive environments, I'll lose that perspective and the sense of inner peace I've had over the last couple of months.\\u201D \\u201CI never want to work for another corporation again,\\u201D said Nicole Peevy, 33, a student and entrepreneur in Los Angeles. She was fired from her job during the pandemic, a crushing blow following a couple of deaths in her family. \\u201CI was so angry [about] how things were initially handled and how employers literally don't care if you work yourself to death, and that really depressed me and caused me to question the purpose of living. I want to work to live, not live to work.\\u201D Getting back to some kind of \\u201Cnormal\\u201D has social implications as well as professional ones, and those can be just as nerve-wracking. \\u201CThe pandemic has shown me there [were] a lot of people in my life before that I spent time with out of fear of not having enough friends or never seeming busy,\\u201D said KB. When the world opens up again, she intends to leave that behind: \\u201CI see my friend group changing a lot and I see myself spending my time much differently.\\u201D KB is far from alone in shifting her social priorities. Some respondents aren\\u2019t sure their relationships will stay the same after seeing what others weren\\u2019t willing to sacrifice for the sake of the collective good. Lauren is a formerly unhoused gig worker who recruits for a ride-share company in Seattle. \\u201CI will not have many friends anymore,\\u201D she said. \\u201CA whole generation of elders was lost in my family. It has been stressful to have 7 family members die while rich white people I know bragged about jumping the COVID vaccine line and used this time to travel instead of following CDC guidelines. I cannot keep people in my life who didn\\u2019t follow guidelines as people died.\\u201D\\u201CI don\\u2019t trust people as much as I did before,\\u201D said Nicole R., a paralegal in New Jersey. \\u201CI\\u2019ve had friends and family lie to my face about not being in contact with someone who has had COVID, just to see my child.\\u201D Katrina Ehrnman-Newton, a librarian in Portland, Oregon, said \\u201CI've lost a lot of the little confidence I had in other people to do the right fucking thing when it counts. Between the rise in racist violence, anti-maskers, and failure to do simple helpful things in the face of death and suffering, my Christian charity is running real low.\\u201D After a year of social distancing, masking up, and avoiding crowds, those with lingering anxieties about getting sick are also wary of resuming close contact with others. Dana, a 35-year-old analyst from Indiana, is nervous about \\u201Cletting people back into my home. It's my office now, so my spaces are even less defined than they were before when I'd work from home once or twice a week. Plus, I don't like the idea of someone just coming in \\u2014 I don't know where they've been and who they've been in contact with.\\u201D Maggie A., a 22-year-old law student, expressed what turned out to be a common concern among respondents: \\u201CI expect I\\u2019ll be terrified about being around large groups of people for a long, long time.\\u201D Given the horrifying surge in anti-Asian violence since the start of the pandemic, some Asian Americans find crowds daunting for another reason. \\u201CI don\\u2019t go out by myself because I\\u2019m always looking over my shoulder hoping that nobody attacks me,\\u201D said Jasmine, a student in Texas. \\u201CI shouldn\\u2019t have to be living in this world afraid.\\u201D \\u201CThe burden of racism that we ... face due to COVID-19 will make my life different,\\u201D said Eunice Kim, a 25-year-old New Yorker. \\u201CI don't want to go to areas where it's predominately white, and I will avoid areas where I know I won't be welcomed because of my race and ethnicity. Being called the Kung Flu, corona, Wuhan virus, and the Chinese virus, I don't think I'll feel safe going back to the life we once had given that so many people make us, Asians, feel guilty.\\u201D Even if the pandemic ends, \\u201CI think I'll be in full survival mode,\\u201D Eunice said. The Atlanta spa shootings also served as a reminder that hatred and mass murder are nothing new in America. The country was just absorbing the tragedy when another shooter killed 10 people in a Boulder, Colorado, grocery store. \\u201CI\\u2019m extremely worried about more mass shootings against people of color,\\u201D said Lauren, the ride-share recruiter in Seattle, expressing concerns many have shared in the wake of this most recent spate of gun violence. Until the Atlanta shootings, there hadn\\u2019t been a large-scale shooting in about a year. Enduring two mass shootings in a single week might be as good a sign as any that we\\u2019re \\u201Cgetting back to normal\\u201D \\u2014 and that \\u201Cnormal\\u201D in America, as one respondent put it, \\u201Cain't shit\\u201D to begin with.Jamie H., a 29-year-old physician assistant in Illinois, is worried that despite the losses we\\u2019ve sustained, we haven\\u2019t properly heeded the pandemic\\u2019s warnings. \\u201CThis year has highlighted our selfishness in some ways, and it makes me nervous that we won't have learned from it,\\u201D Jamie said. \\u201CWe were also able to focus more on human rights and social issues, such as race, poverty, domestic violence.

Katrina, the librarian from Portland, noted that \\u201Cit's hard to feel good about moving forward when there's this massive ocean of grief around you, and what seems like mountains of struggle ahead. It's just more work \\u2014 different work, but more work.\\u201D ●"},{"author":"Margaret Kingsbury","title":"21 Science Fiction And Fantasy Books With Powerful Women Protagonists","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/margaretkingsbury\/powerful-women-science-fiction-fantasy-books-womens-history","content":"Women\\u2019s magic and women\\u2019s votes are both outlawed in this alternative version of 1893.

During the pandemic, Vanderbilt lost her job as an office manager in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which left her with plenty of time to browse QAnon conversations on Telegram and read conspiratorial QAnon posts on Facebook. By October, she was far down the rabbit hole thanks to a family friend, and she even eventually brought one of her cousins in with her. \\u201CI\\u2019d talk to a family member of mine, and he\\u2019d send me articles. I started believing those,\\u201D Vanderbilt told me in January. Indeed, before President Joe Biden\\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, Vanderbilt\\u2019s TikTok was almost completely nonpolitical \\u2014 her posts mostly featured her fiancé dancing while vacuuming, her 4-year-old daughter singing karaoke, and some axioms from her therapist. Engagement on her posts hovered around 20 to 40 likes, and not much more. But the day before Biden would be sworn in as the 46th president, Vanderbilt posted something different. \\u201CI have two crazy theories,\\u201D she said in a video on Jan. 19. \\u201CMy first one is tomorrow, everything goes down\\u2026 I\\u2019m sure [Biden] will be arrested, along with thousands of Hollywood elites and politicians. We need to get our country back to the republic it used to be over a hundred years ago.\\u201D The next day, she posted again from her front porch. \\u201CWell, I was wrong. And it sucks. I have spent the better part of the day crying,\\u201D she said, puffy-eyed. \\u201CI think I need to spend some time on personal development and time in prayer\\u2026 I can\\u2019t go through that heartbreak and disappointment again.\\u201D From there, sometimes multiple times a day, Vanderbilt began posting videos explaining how she got wrapped up in QAnon in the first place, and what she was doing to deprogram herself from beliefs that clearly didn\\u2019t end up being true. \\u201CI thought that before Kamala [Harris] would be taking her oath, getting sworn in, I thought the emergency broadcast system would go across our TV and everything would go black,\\u201D she told me over the phone at the end of January. \\u201CI thought everyone would be arrested and then Trump would be back. Everything would go into martial law.\\u201D For most of the time that Trump was in office, Vanderbilt believed in many QAnon-sanctioned mass delusions, from Pizzagate (the belief that the vast majority of the Democratic Party is engaged in a pedophilia ring) to Tom Hanks and Lady Gaga being baby-eaters (\\u201CLady Gaga was wearing a red dress, and [Q supporters online] were saying Nancy Pelosi wears red shoes a lot. Those people wearing red is supposed to symbolize the blood of those children,\\u201D Vanderbilt told me). She had been so sure that nearly everyone at the inauguration, from Lindsey Graham and George W. Bush to the Clintons and the Obamas, would be arrested. (Garth Brooks, she believed, would have been spared.) But once Biden was inaugurated without incident, it finally became clear to her that the tenets of QAnon that she had believed were all untrue. Vanderbilt isn\\u2019t alone: The inauguration seemed to be an inflection point for a number of QAnon believers who thought Donald Trump would return to office on Jan. 20. In theory, the siege on the Capitol a few weeks prior was just the beginning of the Q storm, sure to end with martial law and a second Trump term \\u2014 despite his election loss. Even after realizing that Kamala Harris would not be arrested and Donald Trump would not be moving back into the White House, Vanderbilt still wasn\\u2019t even clear on what she had really believed. It was through her then-modest TikTok following that she started to understand what she was a part of. \\u201CEverybody on TikTok was telling me it was a cult, or how I\\u2019m feeling, getting out of it, is the same as someone who\\u2019s getting out of a cult,\\u201D she said. \\u201CI don\\u2019t even know where to start. Where do I start looking? For what? There\\u2019s just so much.\\u201D The inauguration hasn\\u2019t signaled an end to QAnon, just the beginning of a new chapter for its believers. I spoke with four former and current QAnon believers over the last few months \\u2014 after Biden\\u2019s inauguration, during Trump\\u2019s second impeachment trial, and again after March 4, a date Q supporters believed would signal Trump\\u2019s return to office. Vanderbilt was the most deprogrammed of all the people I interviewed. Kirk, 37, and Luke, 39, a gay couple based in Texas who asked to go by their first names, still believe in portions of the movement even though Q\\u2019s predictions did not come to pass. And Mark, 51, based in upstate New York, who asked for a pseudonym to protect his family\\u2019s privacy, is still trying to pull his wife out of QAnon, a community she remains firmly rooted in. Q seems to have disappeared for now. Whoever they are, they\\u2019ve largely abandoned their base after riling them up for years \\u2014 and have not posted new \\u201CQ drops\\u201D since 2020. But the people who believe in Q are wrestling with whether to keep on believing or to abandon a cause that, for some, became core to their identities. Some might be deprogramming themselves, while others are cherry-picking the parts of the movement they want to hold on to. But the people I spoke to say their feelings have changed drastically from when they were following the inauguration to when Biden\\u2019s stimulus checks were being sent out. Vanderbilt has been using the weeks after QAnon\\u2019s disintegration to read more, learn more, talk to more people, and question absolutely everything she\\u2019s ever known. \\u201CIt\\u2019s kind of a little bit of a do-over,\\u201D she said after the inauguration. \\u201CI\\u2019m going to learn the world again.\\u201DWhen Vanderbilt and I spoke for the first time, she wasn\\u2019t even yet able to think about a Biden presidency; she was still processing how little she understood about her own political ideology. \\u201CMy dad always said our family is Republican,\\u201D she said. \\u201CWe\\u2019re a Republican family and that was it.\\u201D The first time she voted was in 2016, for Trump; when we spoke, she still believed that the Dominion voting machines used in the 2020 election were owned by Nancy Pelosi\\u2019s husband. (I told her that wasn\\u2019t true and she immediately took me at my word.) Vanderbilt told me she never read any news sites, never fact-checked anything she read on Facebook, and that her only news sources were a QAnon Telegram chat and Jarrin Jackson\\u2019s Facebook page. (Jackson is a right-wing Christian, sympathetic to QAnon beliefs, with more than 50,000 followers.) \\u201CHe goes live every night, and I watched him every night like it was church,\\u201D she said, adding that she followed Jackson to a Telegram chat with more than 10,000 people. \\u201CA couple days before inauguration, I was getting ready to watch Jarrin live and I had this idea in my head that I\\u2019m treating Jarrin\\u2019s [Facebook] Live as if it\\u2019s church. I go to church every Sunday. It was a weird feeling. Am I putting Jarrin above God?\\u201D In fact, Vanderbilt was so protective of Jackson that it wasn\\u2019t until our final call that she would let me use his name in this piece. She just wanted to make sure his privacy was protected, even after she recognized some of his content to be untrue \\u2014 it\\u2019s tough to go against your preacher. \\u201CIt\\u2019s just this feeling that I\\u2019m putting more faith into these [Facebook] Lives than into the prayers that I\\u2019m sending out every night,\\u201D she said. \\u201CThat would be my biggest regret. I\\u2019m always worried I\\u2019m not good enough. I just feel like I\\u2019m inadequate and I\\u2019m terrified to not go to heaven. It\\u2019s shaping how I\\u2019m looking politically.\\u201D Anxiety is a big theme in Vanderbilt\\u2019s life, in or out of Q. Before the inauguration, she was perpetually on alert for some unspeakable horror to occur. How can you live day to day as a mother of a young child without thinking \\u2014 believing \\u2014 that your child might get snatched up by someone in one of those Nancy Pelosi\\u2013run pedophile rings? Mass delusions are, above all, exhausting. \\u201CWhen you\\u2019re in [the rabbit hole], you\\u2019re constantly stressed, you\\u2019re always afraid, because you think everything is bad,\\u201D she said. \\u201CI\\u2019m glad I\\u2019m out of that. Just compare how I feel living with my day-to-day life today versus last week, and it\\u2019s totally different.\\u201D The first time I spoke with Vanderbilt, she wasn\\u2019t yet ready to liken her involvement in QAnon to being a member of a cult, despite the fact that many cult experts think that\\u2019s exactly what it is. \\u201CWhat you see with QAnon is a pattern of coercive persuasion, deception, deceptively recruiting people, radicalizing them online, very much like ISIS and al-Qaeda, which I regard as destructive cults,\\u201D said Rick Alan Ross, a cult deprogrammer and the executive director at the Cult Education Institute. \\u201CIn my mind, the only difference between QAnon and al-Qaeda and ISIS is that the leader of QAnon is an enigma. Other than that, it fits.\\u201DBut that kind of assessment can feel a little too neat \\u2014 after all, not all Q followers are built the same. They don\\u2019t even necessarily agree on the same set of \\u201Cfacts\\u201D or the same desired outcomes. Before the inauguration, Vanderbilt was just hoping for a second Trump term at any cost \\u2014 she wasn\\u2019t aware that much of Q is rooted in racist and antisemitic rhetoric. \\u201CThere are individuals that are radicalized by QAnon that are people that already had deep-seated feelings about minority groups and Jews,\\u201D Ross said. \\u201CA lot of what QAnon talks about is recycled conspiracy theories that echo things like The Protocols of the [Learned] Elders of Zion.\\u201D The Learned Elders of Zion is a text that claimed to be a Jewish plan for world domination, purportedly drawn from meetings held at Basel, Switzerland, in the late 1800s, at the time of the First Zionist Congress. Though it\\u2019s been labeled a hoax, it\\u2019s a text that antisemites have used as justification for their own rhetoric for decades. Similarly, conspiracies around baby-eating, devil-worshipping, and pedophilia among people in power have all been used as antisemitic canards in the past \\u2014 much of the QAnon canon of delusion is just following a long-established tradition of making your enemy look like an amoral, fiendish, satanic monster. But then there are people like Mark and his wife, who were both largely apolitical before his wife\\u2019s involvement in QAnon, though Mark\\u2019s wife was always interested in things like the paranormal, ghosts, and extraterrestrials (which have their own conspiracy theory history). Mark\\u2019s wife \\u2014 who did not know he was speaking to me for this story \\u2014 is a social worker in her mid-forties and started exploring QAnon after getting sucked into the mass delusion of Pizzagate in 2016. The rest of the family, including their two adult children, refuse to discuss her beliefs with her. \\u201CI don\\u2019t really know what happened,\\u201D Mark told me in our first interview. \\u201CI try to talk to her a little bit but she gets mad. Nothing ever really comes true, of course. It seems like there\\u2019s always another plotline.\\u201D In 2008, the couple voted for Obama. Now Mark\\u2019s wife believes in some of the most fringe ideas from QAnon, namely that after the Civil War, the United States ceased being a country and became a corporation through a loan the US received from the Vatican. She also believes that the 2020 inauguration was supposed to be the day that Biden was arrested for a variety of crimes (many against children), and the day that the United States would be restored as a country \\u2014 not a corporation \\u2014 under President Trump. (This doesn\\u2019t take into account, of course, the fact that Trump would have also been an illegitimate president, for which Mark does not have an answer.) She still believes that most of the people in Washington, DC, including politicians on both sides, are currently under house arrest, waiting for Trump to return. Mark told me that while he was sick of hearing his wife talk about Q, he was mostly concerned about their 10- and 12-year-old children, who were only attending class twice a week and were now hearing a lot of their mom\\u2019s theories. \\u201CShe doesn\\u2019t tell them the bad things, the pedophilia and all that,\\u201D he said. \\u201CShe just says Biden\\u2019s never going to be president. I tell them, \\u2018Listen, the whole world knows that Biden is president. Just don\\u2019t go to school saying that. Keep it to yourself.\\u2019\\u201D Mark laughed when he explained his wife\\u2019s theories, but it was always with some bitterness and even embarrassment. It\\u2019s hard to explain that someone you love deeply believes in a version of the world that simply does not exist. \\u201CI love her to death,\\u201D he said. \\u201CI don\\u2019t want to leave her. I just want her to face reality.\\u201DKirk and Luke, meanwhile, seem to fall somewhere in between Vanderbilt\\u2019s aggressive online rehabilitation and Mark\\u2019s wife\\u2019s refusal to recognize a Biden presidency. They also don\\u2019t fit the mold of Q follower: They\\u2019re gay, and Kirk is a libertarian while Luke is more left of center. (Kirk jokes that he red-pilled his partner into QAnon.) \\u201CI can\\u2019t tell you how many times I\\u2019ve been approached with someone assuming that I was a Democrat because I\\u2019m gay,\\u201D Kirk said. When I first talked to Luke and Kirk after Biden\\u2019s inauguration, they were resolute in feeling that Q was no fraud, despite the mass delusion\\u2019s more fringe elements. \\u201CDo Luke and I believe there\\u2019s pedophilia in the government? Yes.\\u201D Kirk said. \\u201CDo we believe that it\\u2019s, you know, satanic, with people doing things around fire pits? No.\\u201DWhat Kirk and Luke do believe, however, seems complicated. They\\u2019re still Trump supporters, still likely to vote for him if he runs in 2024, still completely unwilling to accommodate an argument that Trump was ever a racist (they say his words were merely taken out of context) or that QAnon is rooted in antisemitism (they never heard Q say anything offensive about Jews). But they\\u2019re at a crossroads, seemingly in the throes of detaching from a community they feel has become unwieldy, while still very much believing in its basic tenets. Numerology, for example, continues to be important to them. \\u201CQ is the 17th letter of the alphabet, and one of the things you\\u2019re going to see around President Trump a lot is the number 17,\\u201D Kirk said. \\u201CIn one of his rallies, he [said] he has only been to Washington, DC, a total of 17 times.\\u201D \\u201CNormally, someone would have said, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019ve been about 15 times, or I\\u2019ve been about 20 times,\\u2019\\u201D Luke added. \\u201CHe could\\u2019ve just rounded the number, but 17 is far from that.\\u201D Luke and Kirk are both largely isolated in their homes, partly by choice \\u2014 \\u201CWe\\u2019re almost reclusive,\\u201D Kirk said \\u2014 and partly because of COVID-19. Both of them are immunocompromised; Luke has cerebral palsy and relies on an implanted drug pump to relieve his muscle spasms, and Kirk has panic disorder, fibromyalgia, and spinal damage. Throughout quarantine, their limited socializing has been spent online, dissecting Q drops with others. Even after the inauguration, they were still following Q crumbs, looking for signs that Trump would return: Luke told me that the Trump Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue jacked up its prices for the night of March 4, around $1,300 per room, up from a nightly average of $500. But once it was clear Trump wasn\\u2019t coming back, they were at least willing to give the new president a chance. \\u201CI want to be fair,\\u201D Kirk said. \\u201CI\\u2019m not spitting venom just yet. We\\u2019re still waiting to see what happens. But so far, he\\u2019s signed 17 executive orders today that canceled essentially four years\\u2019 worth of work.\\u201DThe two of them are mainly trying to process a feeling of abandonment: by Q, by Trump, by the larger QAnon community. \\u201CI feel like we were let down, period. Because if the plan was to root out corruption at every source within our Capitol, yes, that failed,\\u201D Kirk said. \\u201CIf the plan was to deliver the House to the other side and lull us all into a false sense of security and complacency, that was a success. But I consider that a failure.\\u201D At the time, Trump had left the White House with little word to his supporters, or to people online who thought that either Trump or Q would give them next steps. It felt, on some level, like a betrayal \\u2014 especially after all Trump\\u2019s voters had done for him. \\u201CWe\\u2019ve been lied to for so long. All of us had,\\u201D Kirk said. \\u201CI blame President Trump for not shutting it down and not saying, when he was asked on several occasions, \\u2018What about these QAnon people?\\u2019\\u201D Even Kirk \\u2014 an avowed Q follower \\u2014 thought Trump let his possible connection to the community go on unconfirmed for too long. \\u201CHe should have said, \\u2018They\\u2019re my supporters. I love them. But they have a few things wrong,\\u2019\\u201D Kirk said. \\u201CIf he would have just said they have a few things wrong, people could have dug deeper. But we were told, \\u2018I\\u2019m either Q or I\\u2019m with Q. So run with it.\\u2019\\u201D To be clear, Trump never claimed to be Q, and in the past he often played coy about the movement, once saying, \\u201CI\\u2019ve heard these are people that love our country.\\u201DWhen I spoke to Vanderbilt a second time, in mid-February, she had gone through a kind of seismic shift in her own understanding of QAnon. Her TikToks, meanwhile, were exploding online. She had thousands of followers who posted hundreds of comments on her videos. She was posting multiple times a day, answering questions and often apologizing for her involvement in a movement she now understood to be racist, antisemitic, and ultimately full of misinformation and lies. She addressed queries about how Q works and how she was working her way out of the community, trying to save others from getting red-pilled themselves. She also started doing more and more interviews on the subject, dialing in remotely to CNN and The View. \\u201CI\\u2019m hoping I\\u2019m doing something good by doing them,\\u201D she told me. \\u201CBut it\\u2019s exhausting. Apparently I never get over the nerves.\\u201D During our second interview, Trump was going through his second impeachment trial, and Vanderbilt said she hoped to see him convicted. She was also concerned about Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a member of Congress and QAnon believer, saying, \\u201CI don\\u2019t think anyone that supports QAnon should be in government.\\u201D Since I spoke with Vanderbilt, a resolution to expel Greene from Congress has been introduced, saying that she \\u201Cadvocated violence against our peers, the speaker, and our government.\\u201D She has also been kicked off all House committees. But Vanderbilt\\u2019s biggest shift was that she was suddenly fact-checking everything. \\u201CI did fact-check that Biden doesn\\u2019t have an island like Epstein,\\u201D she said, half laughing. \\u201CI looked on Associated Press for that one. If I hear something now, and someone\\u2019s telling me something, or they send me a video, I will google it and see if I can find an AP or BBC or Reuters article about it. I\\u2019ve watched CNN news a couple times.\\u201D As we spoke, I could hear her livestream of CSPAN in the background. \\u201CIt\\u2019s crazy!\\u201D she said. \\u201CBut I just don\\u2019t want to fall for any lies ever again.\\u201D Vanderbilt is also contending with things she\\u2019s never thought about before, namely her white privilege. \\u201CI didn\\u2019t pay attention to any of that, and I know that I\\u2019m never going to know what it\\u2019s like to live a life of a minority, ever. I can say all day long I\\u2019m not racist,\\u201D she said. \\u201CBut that\\u2019s not good enough. I want to educate myself and see what I can do and how can I have these conversations and be more open-minded.\\u201D It was through her friends on TikTok that she learned how Trump\\u2019s lone term in office negatively affected people of color; one such follower was a Puerto Rican woman whose family was on the island during Hurricane Maria in 2017. \\u201CTrump was so insensitive to them. He said cruel things about them, which I would never expect anyone to ever say that, but let alone a president,\\u201D she said. (At the time, Trump claimed that the hurricane wasn\\u2019t a \\u201Creal\\u201D catastrophe before complaining about how giving aid to a US territory was putting the budget \\u201Cout of whack.\\u201D)Before Vanderbilt started posting more on TikTok, she wasn\\u2019t even aware of the Trump administration\\u2019s scandal over immigrant children being separated from their families at the border and put in cages. (Which, in all fairness, is still very much happening under a Biden administration.) \\u201CIt\\u2019s horrible,\\u201D she said. \\u201CI can\\u2019t imagine someone taking my kid away from me.\\u201D She thought about the last time she left the country \\u2014 for a trip to Haiti \\u2014 and how easy it was for her to stroll back through the country with her white skin and American passport. \\u201CTo be honest, I never thought I had white privilege,\\u201D she said. \\u201CI sound so ignorant to say that I had no idea. I\\u2019m just now seeing that.\\u201D While Vanderbilt was in the midst of an actual awakening, Mark is still waiting for his wife to have one of her own. He told me she had gotten quieter about her beliefs in the weeks since the inauguration, though not any less sure of them. \\u201CShe came to me a couple weeks ago and showed me two different pictures of Biden, and in one his earlobes are attached, and the other, they aren\\u2019t. She\\u2019s saying there\\u2019s a doppelgänger [of] Biden.\\u201D He laughed while his 6-month-old grandson squirmed in his arms \\u2014 he was babysitting for the day. \\u201CI said, \\u2018Well, maybe he got a facelift.\\u2019\\u201D\\u201CThe storm didn\\u2019t come,\\u201D Mark said. \\u201CShe still thinks something\\u2019s going to happen. On Super Bowl Sunday, she said, \\u2018Keep an eye on the television at 6:30 and tell me if anything happens.\\u2019 That\\u2019s when kickoff is. I think she thought there was going to be a blackout and it was going to be the emergency broadcast.\\u201D Her theory was that since so many people watch the Super Bowl, it would be a good time to broadcast the \\u201Ctruth\\u201D about the government. \\u201C[My kids] were like, \\u2018Well, what were we supposed to look for, Dad?\\u2019\\u201D Mark believes his wife simply doesn\\u2019t want to admit defeat, and he hoped that Trump would be impeached so he wouldn\\u2019t be able to run for office again and they could put this all behind them and just move on. \\u201CI do have those feelings of, am I going to have to get divorced? Is this ever going to change? But I do love her. I\\u2019m hoping it\\u2019s just a phase,\\u201D Mark said. \\u201CNext thing, it\\u2019ll be \\u201924 and Trump will be running again. I\\u2019m hoping it distracts her.\\u201D Though Luke and Kirk still believe in big portions of Q, and though their positive feelings on Biden seemed limited to the possibility of a stimulus check, they still wish other Q acolytes \\u2014 like Mark\\u2019s wife \\u2014 would just let go of any possibility of Trump returning to office during a Biden term. They know the storm isn\\u2019t actually coming. \\u201CFind another star to wish on,\\u201D Kirk said. \\u201CFind something else to put your faith in.\\u201DThere are always dates floating around when it comes to Donald Trump\\u2019s resurgence, or Q\\u2019s promises of governmental reform (which often predict that Trump will become president again and a Democrat-run sex ring will get busted). Even now, some Q followers posit that the real date of reckoning was March 20. Or maybe March 21. Or April 1. The one I heard the most frequently when speaking to Q followers over the last few months was April 20 \\u2014 which is also Hitler\\u2019s birthday, coincidentally or not. This, too, is a long-held characteristic of a cult; there are always arbitrary dates to work toward. \\u201CBy no measure are we done with [Q],\\u201D Ross, the cult deprogrammer, said. \\u201CJehovah\\u2019s Witnesses have predicted the end of the world at least three times; the last time was in the \\u201970s. There were people who sold homes, cashed out insurance policies, that made their plans in life based on the expectation that the end of the world is coming.\\u201D Vanderbilt believes that it\\u2019s still good news if Q followers are chasing dates; at least it tells us exactly where they\\u2019re at. \\u201CWhen there\\u2019s no more date to look forward to, that\\u2019s when they\\u2019re going to start switching their language,\\u201D she said. \\u201CThat\\u2019s when they\\u2019re going to start making plans to overthrow the government. It\\u2019s going to be a Civil War, or a Revolutionary War, all over again. That makes the insurrection a drop in the bucket.\\u201D \\u201CI think in the near future there will still be Q followers,\\u201D Ross told me, adding that it\\u2019s even more likely that these people will just move on to a new movement instead of disavowing Q altogether. \\u201CWhat you see in QAnon is not an original movement, but a composite of themes from other groups that precede QAnon.\\u201D Ross thinks that the Sovereign Citizens, an armed extremist group rooted in racism and antisemitism, is likely where many Q followers will land. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, \\u201CSovereign citizens believe that they \\u2014 not judges, juries, law enforcement, or elected officials \\u2014 get to decide which laws to obey and which to ignore, and they don\\u2019t think they should have to pay taxes.\\u201D Who knows \\u2014 Trump still has yet to formally announce what his next move is, be it television network or political party. But Ross wants to be clear: Trump is no cult leader. \\u201CHe\\u2019s not interesting enough, he\\u2019s not that smart, he\\u2019s not that well read. I just don\\u2019t see him as deliberately brainwashing people.\\u201DEven if QAnon, in the incarnation we once knew it, might be inching toward an end, that doesn\\u2019t mean its followers have dispersed. QAnon followers might just be dormant for now, waiting for the right leader to bring them back to the surface. There will always be new conspiracies to uncover, and for now, many of them center around the COVID vaccine. Mark\\u2019s wife, for instance, has effortlessly moved on to new conspiracy theories, largely focused on tech and pharmaceutical companies. \\u201CBecause everything\\u2019s falling apart, they\\u2019re turning everywhere: Bill Gates is trying to be like Thanos and kill half the population,\\u201D Mark said. \\u201CThey can regrow limbs and there\\u2019s all this stuff that big tech has kept from us.\\u201D Mark hasn\\u2019t gotten the COVID shot \\u2014 he said he doesn\\u2019t get vaccines for \\u201Cstuff that you can get better from\\u201D; his wife is completely unwilling to get it, believing that the shot may hurt her. Meanwhile, their eldest son \\u2014 who has asthma \\u2014 is still getting the vaccine, even if his mother thinks he has a 50% chance of dying from it. Luke and Kirk, meanwhile, are both ready and waiting for the vaccine. Of all the people I\\u2019ve spoken to about QAnon in the last few years, they\\u2019re the most complicated to explain. They believe in some of it and outright reject the rest. It\\u2019s hard to boil down their beliefs because a lot of them aren\\u2019t even about Q. They just don\\u2019t really like the Democrats \\u2014 but they also don\\u2019t like big swaths of the Republican Party. (Don\\u2019t get them started on \\u201CLyin\\u2019 Ted.\\u201D) They were also quick to accept defeat. \\u201CThings have passed,\\u201D Kirk said. \\u201CLook forward. Stop looking at what could have been. I stopped a long time ago watching for dates, because they don\\u2019t pan out. But if they do, you\\u2019re pleasantly surprised instead of being disappointed.\\u201DVanderbilt has embraced this wish to look forward. But despite having one of the quickest trajectories out of Q, she still has quite a personal mess to clean up. She\\u2019s now terrified for completely different reasons, and plagued with guilt and doubt \\u2014 guilt over her involvement in something she now sees as racist, and doubt over whether she\\u2019s actually right this time. \\u201CWhat if I\\u2019m wrong?\\u201D she said. \\u201CWhat does next year at this time look like? Like, if crap hits the fan and they end up being right, now I\\u2019m going to be a target. It\\u2019s just, it\\u2019s shaken me.\\u201D Vanderbilt has recently stopped posting about Q on her TikTok account \\u2014 which is now private \\u2014 and fitted it with a new username. Instead, she\\u2019s posting more about her mental health, namely the panic attacks she\\u2019s been experiencing. It\\u2019s unclear if she\\u2019s experiencing symptoms from some underlying mental health issues she\\u2019s always had \\u2014 including PTSD from a serious car accident she and her daughter were in three years ago \\u2014 or if it\\u2019s part of recovering from Q. \\u201CAm I making myself a target to the people that are angry in QAnon?\\u201D she said. \\u201CI mean, I\\u2019m just readily available. They know where I live.\\u201D She\\u2019s spending her time figuring out the right medication combination for her \\u2014 as well as sorting through her feelings about the vaccine. (Unsurprisingly, they all seem to be pulling from the same conspiracy theories about vaccines, which are also definitely untrue.) \\u201CI\\u2019m not afraid that there\\u2019s a chip in there,\\u201D she said, which is exactly what Mark\\u2019s wife thinks and is also a long-standing conspiracy theory about nanotechnology supposedly being in vaccines. Vanderbilt\\u2019s current goal is to work through those anxieties to eventually get to a place where she can, comfortably, get the shot. \\u201CI don\\u2019t know why, I still feel like I would die if I got it. For some reason, I\\u2019m relating \\u2018vaccine\\u2019 and \\u2018death\\u2019 together,\\u201D she told me. \\u201CI feel like a crazy person.\\u201D Mostly, she wants to focus on her life after Q instead of dwelling on the past. She even got her job back. But her quiet work of rehabilitation continues. \\u201CI hope it doesn\\u2019t make me a hypocrite,\\u201D she said. \\u201CI\\u2019m interviewing and I\\u2019m, you know, being an example and stuff. And it\\u2019s like, sometimes I wonder if they think, Oh, she\\u2019s, she\\u2019s completely free and clear. She\\u2019s of sound mind. And like, I\\u2019m still struggling.\\u201D She still has no idea whether she\\u2019s a Republican, a Democrat, or an independent. She\\u2019s still struggling to determine what media figures and outlets she can trust. All she knows for sure is that she survived something brutal \\u2014 in fact, she made a coffee tumbler for herself with a slogan printed on the side, to remind her for the rest of her life: \\u201CI SURVIVED CULT 45.\\u201D ●"},{"author":"Pranav Dixit","title":"I Thought My Job Was To Report On Tech In India. Instead, I\u2019ve Watched Democracy Decline.","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/pranavdixit\/indian-government-using-tech-destroy-democracy","content":"I was in a cavernous college auditorium on the frigid winter afternoon in New Delhi in 2015 when Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, was selling the promise of India, his home country and the company\\u2019s largest market, to 2,000 high school and college students. \\u201CPart of the reason we\\u2019re all very interested in India is that it\\u2019s an amazingly young country,\\u201D he said. \\u201CIt\\u2019s a vast country, and in so many ways, we do think the trends of the future will come from places like that.\\u201D Over the next few years, American tech companies hungry for growth set their sights on India, where hundreds of millions of people were coming online for the first time thanks to cheap Android phones and crashing data prices. Venture capital coursed through Bangalore\\u2019s clogged streets. Millions of Indians were suddenly booking their first Uber rides, receiving their first Amazon packages, watching their first Netflix shows, and having their first WhatsApp chats, some of it powered by the free Wi-Fi that Google was blanketing the country\\u2019s railway stations with. A great churning was upon us. My colleague Mat Honan described those years as a \\u201Cmanifestation of the hope and excitement of the next billion not only coming online, but coming into power,\\u201D when he profiled Pichai in 2016. \\u201CIt feels like a nation on the make.\\u201D Tech made us and unmade us. Before Facebook let misinformation thrive, before Twitter let the trolls run wild, and before WhatsApp got Indians lynched, tech companies unshackled us and promised a billion people a seat at the same table the rest of the world was at \\u2014 as long as they had an inexpensive data plan. But at the same time, a different kind of churning was underway. In 2014, a year before Pichai flew down to India, millions of Indians had voted for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a right-wing politician with deep roots in the RSS, a Hindu nationalist organization that his Bharatiya Janata Party draws its ideology from. Many people had hoped that Modi would usher in economic prosperity, but instead, India\\u2019s democracy has crumbled. Ham-fisted decisions like banning most banknotes destroyed India\\u2019s cash-based economy, while crimes against minorities shot up. Journalists were harassed, jailed, and shot; human rights activists languished in jail for years without trials; communal clashes erupted in the capital; millions spoke out against a contentious new citizenship law that fast-tracks Indian citizenship for members of major South Asian religions except Islam; and for months, farmers have protested new agricultural laws that they said would hurt their businesses.For years, I let these incidents play out in the background of my consciousness. I grimaced as I scrolled through my Twitter feed full of bloodshed and violence and anger each week, and drowned weekends in alcohol and video games to numb the pain. But each Monday, I threw myself back into tech news, trying to keep up with Silicon Valley, a world away from India\\u2019s dust and grime and blood and murky politics. To friends in the country who write about crime and politics from the frontlines, I sent WhatsApp texts of admiration and solidarity. But I told myself that I didn\\u2019t need to get mixed up. I was a tech reporter, I reasoned, and the biggest news in my industry each September was new iPhones. Separating what I cover from the horrors unfolding around me became my coping mechanism. But unfortunately, it hasn\\u2019t worked for a while. For years, I tried to live in the comforting fiction that what was happening in India and what was happening in the world of tech were separate things \\u2014 but that isn't true anymore.For more than a year, India\\u2019s government first cut off and then throttled internet access to Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir after unilaterally withdrawing the disputed region\\u2019s autonomy. Facebook executives reportedly shielded members of India\\u2019s ruling party from the platform\\u2019s hate speech rules to protect the company\\u2019s business interests. Right-wing trolls have used social media platforms to harass women who they say offended their religious sensibility. Hindu nationalists have repeatedly taken offense to original shows that Netflix and Amazon have produced, claiming that the platforms were offending Hindu gods and promoting \\u201Clove jihad,\\u201D a conspiracy theory that accuses Muslim men of converting Hindu women. In 2020, rioters used Facebook Live to incite violence in Delhi. Last month, India\\u2019s government threatened to jail Twitter executives for not complying with an order to block hundreds of accounts, many of which were critical of the government, and Delhi police briefly threw a young climate activist in jail after charging her with sedition for editing a Google Doc. I love tech. But watching it intersect with a Hindu nationalist government trying to crush dissent, choke a free press, and destroy a nation\\u2019s secular ethos doesn\\u2019t feel like something I bought a ticket to. Writing about technology from India now feels like having a front-row seat to the country\\u2019s rapid slide into authoritarianism. \\u201CIt\\u2019s like watching a train wreck while you\\u2019re inside the train,\\u201D I Slacked my boss in November.In the physical world, it seemed like things were spiraling out of control. At the end of 2019, protests about the controversial new citizenship law roiled the nation. In January 2020, masked goons unleashed violence at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, whose students and staff are frequently branded by the ruling party as \\u201Canti-national.\\u201D Soon after, communal riots rocked New Delhi, the city I live in. More than 50 people died. But still, millions of Indians could freely voice their opinions online, at least when the government didn\\u2019t shut down their internet. This February, it felt like the walls finally closed in. In the final week of that month, India\\u2019s government imposed draconian rules that gave it the last word over what social media platforms will leave up, what streaming services will show, and what news websites will publish. It might also require messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal to break their encryption so that it can track who texted whom. Social media companies are now required to take down anything the government deems problematic within three days, and anything that law enforcement is unhappy with within 36 hours. Platforms must also hand over people\\u2019s information to law enforcement agencies if they ask for it. If the platforms fail to comply, their local staff can be prosecuted, and companies could lose their protection from being held liable for content that people post. If anyone in India takes offense to any scene in any show or any movie on any streaming service, they can file a complaint. If a service doesn\\u2019t respond or give a satisfactory explanation, the person who complained can appeal to the federal government, which can then compel services to censor, edit, or take down the content. A new government committee can now make online news publications change, delete, or issue apologies for stories, podcasts, videos, or social media posts \\u2014 or shut them down entirely. If a platform, streaming service, or website finds a demand unreasonable or unlawful, there are no meaningful ways to push back. Unless the courts step in, our internet is now in shackles. When the rules were announced, experts around the country cried foul. The Internet Freedom Foundation, an organization in New Delhi that fights for digital rights, said that the new rules would \\u201Cfundamentally change the way the internet will be experienced in India\\u201D and termed them \\u201Cunconstitutional.\\u201D Editors of digital news operations have said that the new rules \\u201Crun us down\\u201D and have called them \\u201Can attempt to kill digital democracy.\\u201D But so far, American technology companies have been silent.Netflix, Amazon, and WhatsApp declined my requests to comment on the new rules. Facebook and Google did not respond. A Twitter spokesperson said, \\u201CTwitter supports a forward-looking approach to regulation that protects the Open Internet, drives universal access, and promotes competition and innovation. We believe regulation is beneficial when it safeguards citizens\\u2019 fundamental rights and reinforces online freedoms. We are studying the updated Intermediary Guidelines and engaging with a range of organizations and entities impacted by them. We look forward to continued engagement with the Government of India and hope a balance across transparency, freedom of expression, and privacy is promoted.\\u201D When I talk to rank-and-file employees at these companies, they seem on edge. There\\u2019s a lot of nervous laughter. Some people stammer and trip over their sentences. \\u201CI don\\u2019t know if I should talk about that,\\u201D someone says. Few people want to say anything, and those who do worry about not just losing their jobs for speaking to journalists but also retaliation from powerful politicians. \\u201CHonestly, I haven\\u2019t been getting much sleep these days,\\u201D a Twitter employee recently told me. Another person who works for a social media company told me they were trying to figure out who is at risk of going to jail if the government cracks down. US tech companies are certainly not saviors. They seem to have a different set of standards for the rest of the world. In India, Twitter lets far-right bigots get away with hate speech and harassment. WhatsApp is full of rumors and lies. And Facebook is Facebook. They have all let us down in countless ways. Still, it would suck if their employees in India became victims of the country\\u2019s majoritarian politics and ended up behind bars. I know that it isn't just India where things have gone downhill. Over the last four years, I\\u2019ve watched the US get swept up in a mass delusion called QAnon that went from the internet into the Capitol itself. But unlike his Indian employees, Mark Zuckerberg isn\\u2019t in any danger of going to prison. American democracy itself seems to have prevailed. What if ours doesn\\u2019t?I feel envious of the lives that my friends, family, and colleagues in the US lead, and the freedoms they take for granted. I am envious of the fucking First Amendment. I want a First Amendment too. On a bright spring morning in March, I slumped on the couch after a Washington, DC, NGO declared that India is only \\u201Cpartly free.\\u201D When a Swedish institute downgraded the country\\u2019s status from a democracy to an \\u201Celectoral autocracy\\u201D weeks later, I took a mental health day from work. My therapist tells me to engage my \\u201Csoothing system,\\u201D so I cool off by chainsawing video game demons in Doom Eternal. But no matter how many I kill, the demons in my head keep respawning. I can\\u2019t sleep, so I lurk in Slack till the early hours of dawn, watching colleagues on the other side of the world discussing bad tweets, Oprah, Yahoo Answers, and the coronavirus. I am envious of the American news cycle full of stories about crazy people paying millions of dollars for digital art. When someone asks me why I am still up long past midnight, I mumble something about needing to fix my sleep cycle. Then I am back on the train, hurtling me and a billion people faster and faster toward God knows what.Sometimes, I think about that frigid day in 2015 when Pichai was gushing about India\\u2019s potential to thousands of bright young students. I wonder what they are up to, and if they still have the same dreams and aspirations six years later. I wonder if they got jobs, and if they got laid off. I wonder if Pichai, the CEO of a trillion-dollar internet giant, saw what was coming when he was betting on the future of his company. \\u201CI can\\u2019t remember a time when simply existing in this country was so stressful,\\u201D I wrote on my private Instagram account. \\u201CSeriously, how is everyone in the media coping with the constant glut of bad news every single day?\\u201D I tweeted last month. \\u201CPersonally, I\\u2019m shot.\\u201D Dozens of people slide into my DMs. Someone tells me to get a pet. Others tell me to subscribe to National Geographic. \\u201CAnything that keeps you off hardcore news but is still about the world you live in,\\u201D they say. I don\\u2019t subscribe to National Geographic. Instead, I spend more and more time on blogs and YouTube channels discussing gadgets and Apple rumors. There\\u2019s something soothing about simply watching someone unbox a shiny new phone and speculating about new features in the next version of macOS. In the last week of March, news about an Apple event briefly cleanses my blood-soaked Twitter timeline. In June, we\\u2019ll finally see what the new operating system that powers the new iPhones and Apple Watches will look like. We might even see new smart glasses, overly obsessed fans say. With each passing year, watching Tim Cook saunter onstage to sell thousand-dollar smartphones has felt more and more like watching a two-hour commercial that changes only slightly each time it runs. But this year, I can\\u2019t wait \\u2014 if only to tune out of the real world for a while. ●"},{"author":"Caroline O'Donovan","title":"Amazon Has Defeated The Union Drive In Alabama","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/carolineodonovan\/amazon-workers-bessemer-union-election","content":"The votes in the union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, have finally been counted, and the victor is Amazon: The majority of workers who cast ballots voted against the effort to form what would have been the company\\u2019s first unionized facility in the US. The outcome follows a long and aggressive anti-union campaign by Amazon. It\\u2019s already being challenged by the union, which said in a statement Friday that it will file an objection to the result with the National Labor Relations Board, \\u201Ccharging that Amazon interfered with the right of its Bessemer, Alabama employees to vote in a free and fair election,\\u201D according to a press release. Of the approximately 5,800 workers eligible to vote in the election, 3,215 cast ballots, which were submitted by mail starting in early February; 1,798 of those votes were against the union, with 738 in favor. \\u201CIt\\u2019s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that\\u2019s not true,\\u201D the company wrote in a press release. \\u201COur employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us. And Amazon didn\\u2019t win\\u2014our employees made the choice to vote against joining a union.\\u201D Despite various efforts over the years, no Amazon worker in the US has ever successfully joined a union, though the company does contract with some unionized firms in the airline and film industries. \\u201COur system is broken, Amazon took full advantage of that, and we will be calling on the labor board to hold Amazon accountable for its illegal and egregious behavior during the campaign,\\u201D said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which organized the drive. \\u201CBut make no mistake about it; this still represents an important moment for working people and their voices will be heard.\\u201D At a union press conference on Friday, Appelbaum said the union believes a redo of the NLRB election in Bessemer at some point is \\u201Cvery likely.\\u201D He also said the union is in touch with Amazon workers at other facilities around the country about forming a union. \\u201CI think there\\u2019s a moment in American life that this campaign captured,\\u201D he said. \\u201CWhat we have seen is the revulsion of the extraordinary inequality in our society.\\u201D Amazon pushed hard against the union\\u2019s effort to organize workers, holding what are known as \\u201Ccaptive audience\\u201D meetings, in which employees watch anti-union videos; making allegedly coercive statements on an anti-union website; and even allegedly changing the pattern of a local stoplight to prevent the union from conducting outreach to workers waiting in their cars. On Thursday, the Washington Post reported that Amazon pressured the US Postal Service over email to install a mailbox to collect ballots outside the facility in Bessemer. The emails were sent after the NLRB had ruled that placing a ballot drop box on the premises could constitute illegal surveillance of workers while voting. The union may use the dispute over the drop box, as well as other allegations of unfair labor practices by Amazon in Alabama, in an attempt to appeal the results of the election. At a press conference held by Amazon after the vote count, employees discussed their reasons for voting against the union. \\u201CWe\\u2019re talking about us coming to Amazon during a pandemic time when regular jobs were not available,\\u201D said Lavonette Stokes. \\u201CThe opportunities [at Amazon] are great.\\u201D It\\u2019s difficult to say what effect the union\\u2019s loss could have on ongoing organizing efforts elsewhere within Amazon, but the setback underscores why workers, including those at company, are increasingly experimenting with methods of unionizing that circumvent the NLRB process."},{"author":"Ryan Mac","title":"See If Your Police Used Facial Recognition Tech Clearview AI","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/ryanmac\/facial-recognition-local-police-clearview-ai-table","content":"Clearview AI has created a powerful facial recognition tool and marketed it to police departments and government agencies. The company has never disclosed the entities that have used its facial recognition software, but a confidential source provided BuzzFeed News with data that appeared to be a list of agencies and companies whose employees have tried or used its technology. Using that data, along with public records and interviews we have created a searchable database of US-based taxpayer-funded entities, including tribal, local, and state police departments publicly funded university law enforcement bodies; district attorneys\\u2019 offices; and federal agencies such as the Air Force and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. We have included only those agencies for which the data shows that at least one associated individual ran at least one facial recognition scan as of February 2020. The database has limitations. Clearview has neither verified nor disputed the underlying data. The data begins in 2018 and ends in February 2020, so it does not account for any activity after that time or for any additional organizations that may have started using Clearview after February 2020. Not all searches corresponded to an investigation, and some agencies told us that their employees had merely run test searches to see how well the technology worked. BuzzFeed News created search ranges based on data that showed how many times individuals at a given organization ran photos through Clearview.We found inaccuracies in the data, including organizations with misspelled names or placed in the wrong state, and we moved to correct those issues when they could be confirmed. If we were not able to confirm the existence of an entity, we removed it. BuzzFeed News gave every agency or organization in this database the opportunity to comment on whether it had used Clearview\\u2019s technology and if the software had led to any arrests. Of the 1,803 entities in this database:Responses from the agencies, including if they denied using Clearview\\u2019s technology or did not respond to requests for comment, are included in the table. Just because an agency appears on the list does not mean BuzzFeed News was able to confirm that it actually used the tool, or that its officials approved its employees\\u2019 use of Clearview. By searching this database, you affirm that you understand its limitations."},{"author":"Ryan Mac","title":"Clearview AI Offered Thousands Of Cops Free Trials","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/ryanmac\/clearview-ai-local-police-facial-recognition","content":"A controversial facial recognition tool designed for policing has been quietly deployed across the country with little to no public oversight. According to reporting and data reviewed by BuzzFeed News, more than 7,000 individuals from nearly 2,000 public agencies nationwide have used Clearview AI to search through millions of Americans\\u2019 faces, looking for people, including Black Lives Matter protesters, Capitol insurrectionists, petty criminals, and their own friends and family members. BuzzFeed News has developed a searchable table of 1,803 publicly funded agencies whose employees are listed in the data as having used or tested the controversial policing tool before February 2020. These include local and state police, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Air Force, state healthcare organizations, offices of state attorneys general, and even public schools. In many cases, leaders at these agencies were unaware that employees were using the tool; five said they would pause or ban its use in response to questions about it. Our reporting is based on data that describes facial recognition searches conducted on Clearview AI between 2018 and February 2020, as well as tens of thousands of pages of public records, and outreach to every one of the hundreds of taxpayer-funded agencies included in the dataset.The data, provided by a source who declined to be named for fear of retribution, has limitations. When asked about it in March of this year, Clearview AI did not confirm or dispute its authenticity. Some 337 public entities in the dataset confirmed to BuzzFeed News that their employees had tested or worked with the software, while 210 organizations denied any use. Most entities \\u2014 1,159 \\u2014 did not respond to questions about whether they had used it. Still, the data indicates that Clearview has broadly distributed its facial recognition software to federal agencies and police departments nationwide, offering the app to thousands of police officers and government employees, who at times used it without training or oversight. Often, agencies that acknowledged their employees had used the software confirmed it happened without the knowledge of their superiors, let alone the public they serve.Such widespread use of Clearview means that facial recognition may have been used in your hometown with very few people knowing about it. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Hoan Ton-That, the company\\u2019s cofounder and CEO, said it was \\u201Cgratifying to see how quickly Clearview AI has been embraced by US law enforcement.\\u201D He declined to answer more than 50 detailed questions about the company's practices and relationships with law enforcement agencies. \\u201CAmericans shouldn\\u2019t have to rely on BuzzFeed to learn their local law enforcement agencies were using flawed facial recognition technology,\\u201D Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CThis report pulls back the curtain on Clearview\\u2019s shady campaign to encourage the secret adoption of its service by local police. Inaccurate facial recognition will inevitably cause innocent people to be wrongly accused and convicted of crimes and could very well lead to tragedies.\\u201DFor years, law enforcement agencies have experimented with facial recognition, a technology that promises to help identify people of interest by matching surveillance photos to known images \\u2014 such as a headshot from a driver\\u2019s license or passport. But there are several barriers to its adoption, including high costs, unreliable results, and public opposition. Clearview has pushed its technology into the mainstream with a product it claims is both more accurate and cost-effective than those of its competitors. For a time, it made the tool accessible via a free trial to almost any law enforcement officer who wanted to sign up. \\u201CI found this site on a law enforcement web site last year, I set up an account to see if it worked,\\u201D Adrian Williams, police chief in Wilson\\u2019s Mills, North Carolina, wrote to BuzzFeed News in December 2020. Williams said he had tested Clearview AI using his own personal photos, but the software returned no matches. \\u201CI ran two known persons to see if they came back with any useful info. I didn\\u2019t think it worked the way the ad said it would,\\u201D he said. The New York City\\u2013based startup claims to have amassed one of the largest-known repositories of pictures of people\\u2019s faces \\u2014 a database of more than 3 billion images scraped without permission from places such as Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. If you\\u2019ve posted images online, your social media profile picture, vacation snapshots, or family photos may well be part of a facial recognition dragnet that\\u2019s been tested or used by law enforcement agencies across the country.Data analyzed by BuzzFeed News indicated that individuals at some 1,803 agencies \\u2014 which were all contacted and asked whether they had ever used Clearview \\u2014 ran almost 340,000 searches. Based on conversations with people who have used the software, a Clearview search may include a demonstration scan at a trade show, a police officer looking up a colleague as a test, or an actual investigative attempt to find a person of interest. While this database represents only a snapshot of Clearview\\u2019s reach as of February 2020, it provides unprecedented insight into how facial recognition technology can spread through law enforcement agencies across the country. Smaller police departments were among Clearview\\u2019s earliest users. Officials in Mountain Brook, Alabama, which has a population of about 20,000, tested the product and ran nearly 590 searches. In Illinois, the secretary of state\\u2019s office ran nearly 8,900 searches, telling BuzzFeed News that the software was used \\u201Cto assist other law enforcement agencies in their investigations.\\u201D A police department crime analyst in Leawood, Kansas, tried Clearview thanks to a recommendation from a peer, only to discover another detective had already been using the software, a spokesperson said. The two officers ran 50 searches before the department decided it didn\\u2019t want to buy the product. The Wyoming Highway Patrol gave Clearview a go for about three weeks last February, Sgt. Jeremy Beck said. Even representatives at Washington\\u2019s Department of Fish and Wildlife and Minnesota\\u2019s Commerce Fraud Bureau confirmed to BuzzFeed News that individuals within their organizations tested the software. A spokesperson for Iowa\\u2019s public defender\\u2019s office said people used it \\u201Cto better understand how law enforcement might use it.\\u201D Following an inquiry from BuzzFeed News, the Washington National Guard\\u2019s Counterdrug Program found that an instructor at its Western Regional Counterdrug Training Center had not only registered to use Clearview\\u2019s facial recognition software without permission but had also incorporated it into the curriculum for an officer training course. This course was open to \\u201Cfederal, state, local and tribal law enforcement,\\u201D per emails obtained by BuzzFeed News through a public records request.\\u201CAny mention of this software has now been stripped from our training materials,\\u201D said Karina Shagren, communications director for Washington\\u2019s military department. \\u201CAnd we\\u2019re now conducting a top-down review of all training programs.\\u201D Clearview\\u2019s promotional materials and communications with law enforcement agencies were obtained via more than 140 public records requests from BuzzFeed News. The documents detail the startup\\u2019s flood-the-market strategy, in which it hawked free trials of its technology to seemingly anyone with an email address associated with the government or a law enforcement agency and told them to \\u201Crun wild.\\\" The data shows that this marketing push put an unproven and federally unregulated facial recognition tool into the hands of people associated with taxpayer-funded agencies in the District of Columbia, the US Virgin Islands, and every state except Vermont. After March 2020, according to emails obtained via a public records request, Clearview placed a few checks on its free trial program, including the requirement of a superior's approval and appointment of an administrator to monitor use. Clearview\\u2019s website was also updated last month to state that officers have to provide a case number before conducting a search. But between summer 2019 and February 2020, none of these checks existed. Any officer could sign up, and Clearview explicitly encouraged them to test its software on friends and family members. \\u201CNo strings attached,\\u201D a November 2019 email to police in Lakeland, Florida, reads. \\u201CIt only takes one minute to install and you can start searching immediately.\\u201D In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Ton-That said that in two years the company had helped \\u201Cthousands of agencies\\u201D solve crimes including \\u201Cchild exploitation, financial fraud, and murder,\\u201D but did not provide specific examples when asked. \\u201CAs a young startup, we\\u2019re proud of our record of accomplishment and will continue to refine our technology, cybersecurity, and compliance protocols,\\u201D he said. \\u201CWe also look forward to working with policymakers on best practices to forge a proper balance between privacy and security that serves the interests of families and communities across America.\\u201DCreated by Ton-That, an Australian-born college dropout who traveled in far-right circles, Clearview AI debuted in 2017 as SmartCheckr, a tool for tracking people across disparate social media platforms. With funding from Facebook board member Peter Thiel, the company changed its name a year later when it began focusing on facial recognition. Clearview has touted its software as the \\u201Cworld\\u2019s best facial-recognition technology,\\u201D but its most novel innovation is doing what no other company has been willing to do: rip billions of personal photos from social media and the web without permission or consent. In his statement, Ton-That compared Clearview to a search engine and said the facial recognition tool only searches public information available on the internet. \\u201CThe work we do is fully protected by the First Amendment and complies with all applicable laws,\\u201D he said. Critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union, disagree. \\u201CProtecting privacy means maintaining control of private information that is most revealing of our identities, our activities, our selfhood, and Clearview\\u2019s business is based on taking that control away from people without their consent,\\u201D Nathan Freed Wessler, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU, told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CYou can change your Social Security number if it is taken without your consent, but you can\\u2019t change your face.\\u201DLast May, the ACLU sued Clearview for allegedly violating an Illinois law overseeing the collection of biometric data by private companies. The company is also facing multidistrict litigation for the sale of its technology in Illinois \\u2014 an alleged violation of a state biometric privacy law \\u2014 a suit from the Vermont attorney general, and a suit from Latinx and Chicanx rights group Mijente. Facebook, LinkedIn, Google, and Twitter have all sent Clearview cease-and-desist letters alleging that the company violated its terms of service by scraping people\\u2019s data. (All four companies declined to say if they have plans to take further legal action against Clearview.) None of this has hampered Clearview\\u2019s aggressive marketing efforts toward law enforcement. The company regularly promoted itself to email lists of officers with claims that its software can scan \\u201Cover 1 billion faces in less than a second\\\" and that it is \\u201C100% accurate across all demographic groups.\\\" This strategy has worked brilliantly. By February 2020, almost 2,000 taxpayer-funded entities and police departments across the US had at least one person run at least one search with Clearview, according to data reviewed by BuzzFeed News. The company assured those users in marketing emails that the more searches they ran, the more likely they were to match a suspect. Wessler condemned the company\\u2019s marketing. \\u201CTheir claims of near-perfect identification have never been substantiated, and the pervasive tracking of our faces and whereabouts with a flawed technology is just too dangerous to have in the hands of the government,\\u201D he said.In recent years, Clearview reached hundreds of law enforcement agencies by using a sales strategy commonplace among software companies like Slack or Dropbox. Rather than rely on standard procurement channels to make a sale, it also targeted individual employees with free trials. That allowed Clearview to create internal demand in a bottom-up manner with the hope that users would advocate within their departments to move to a paid version. These free trials have helped Clearview create a broad swath of connections with local police officers; Ton-That recently claimed that 3,100 law enforcement agencies have used the software as of March 2021. Listed in the data BuzzFeed reviewed, for example, were more than 40 individuals in the New York Police Department who had collectively run over 11,000 searches \\u2014 the most of any entity as of February 2020. The NYPD announced new facial recognition policies in March 2020 following a BuzzFeed News story that detailed how it used the software. The New York State Police ran more than 5,100 searches and used the software \\u201Cto generate potential leads in criminal investigations as well as homeland security cases involving a clearly identified public safety issue,\\u201D according to Beau Duffy, director of public information. The data lists other police departments that have run more than 4,000 searches as of February 2020: Bergen County Sheriff\\u2019s Office in New Jersey (more than 7,800), Indiana State Police (more than 5,700), Broward County Sheriff\\u2019s Office in Florida (more than 6,300), and Jefferson Parish Sheriff\\u2019s Office in Louisiana (nearly 4,200). Indiana State Police confirmed its use of Clearview. The Broward County and Jefferson Parish offices did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A Bergen County Sheriff spokesperson denied the agency used Clearview. According to data reviewed by BuzzFeed News, individuals at 15 different state attorneys general offices tried the software, including those in Texas, Alabama, and New Jersey, which banned its own law enforcement agencies from using it in January 2020. The Texas attorney general\\u2019s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment, while a spokesperson for the Alabama attorney general\\u2019s office said it \\u201Chad no contracts with Clearview AI.\\u201DWhen BuzzFeed News notified the California attorney general\\u2019s office of accounts tied to its employees, a spokesperson said the state\\u2019s Department of Justice had \\u201Cnot authorized the use of facial recognition software.\\u201D The department subsequently blocked access to Clearview\\u2019s website on employees\\u2019 devices, the spokesperson added, \\u201Cout of an abundance of caution.\\u201D Individuals associated with public schools have also apparently tried the company\\u2019s facial recognition software. As of early 2020, data reviewed by BuzzFeed News lists 31 public community colleges and universities \\u2014 including the University of Alabama and West Virginia University, neither of which responded to multiple requests for comment. A spokesperson for California State University, Long Beach, confirmed a detective had reviewed the platform\\u2019s capabilities on a 30-day trial. Records seen by BuzzFeed News show that individuals associated with two high schools \\u2014 Somerset Berkley Regional High School in Massachusetts and Central Montco Technical High School in Pennsylvania \\u2014 and Texas\\u2019s Katy Independent School District appear to have run searches. Officials at Central Montco Technical High School did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the Somerset Police Department, which is tied to Somerset Berkley Regional High, according to data seen by BuzzFeed News, confirmed that a detective had used Clearview on a 30-day trial. A spokesperson for Katy Independent School District\\u2019s police department said that the agency does not use facial recognition software and did not answer follow-up questions. In marketing statements, Clearview claims its software has been used to help identify child predators. And to some extent these claims were born out in BuzzFeed News\\u2019 reporting. ICE \\u2014 as well as police in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, and Raleigh, North Carolina \\u2014 told BuzzFeed News the software had been used in such cases. \\u201CClearview AI is most often used to investigate formidable crimes that are extraordinary in nature, such as reports of human trafficking and shootings,\\u201D said Laura Hourigan, a spokesperson for the Raleigh Police Department. \\u201CThese searches are fairly narrow in their scope, are limited, and are focused specifically on what they are looking for at that time.\\u201D Ton-That told BuzzFeed News that law enforcement agencies have also used Clearview to identify insurrectionists who stormed the US Capitol on Jan. 6, though he declined to provide specifics. Data seen by BuzzFeed News shows that the US Capitol Police used Clearview to run more than 60 searches as of early 2020. It\\u2019s unclear if the Capitol Police, the main law enforcement agency tasked with protecting Congress, still has access to the facial recognition tool. A spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Clearview\\u2019s free trials, most of which give users unlimited searches for 30 days, may have also helped put its software into the hands of employees at many of the nation\\u2019s largest law enforcement agencies. Individuals associated with the departments of Justice, Defense, and State have all apparently tried the facial recognition software, according to data reviewed by BuzzFeed News. Spokespeople for those departments declined or did not respond to requests for comment. The data lists people at the five largest branches of the US military \\u2014 the Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, and Marines \\u2014 as having used the company\\u2019s software. The US Army Criminal Investigation Command, which pursues violations of military law, had run more than 1,300 searches as of February 2020, according to the data. In December 2019, the Air Force signed a $50,000 exploratory contract with Clearview \\u201Cto determine if there was an operational need,\\u201D according to a branch spokesperson. The Army, Navy, and Air Force did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokesperson for the Marine Corps said there was no indication that anybody at the service branch had used Clearview. A spokesperson said the Coast Guard \\u201Cdoes not use Clearview AI.\\u201D An FBI spokesperson declined to comment on the agency\\u2019s investigative tools and techniques, though records seen by BuzzFeed News list individuals at more than 20 bureau offices as having run over 5,800 Clearview searches as of early 2020. Those same records show that employees at US Customs and Border Protection as having registered more than 270 accounts and run nearly 7,500 searches, the most of any federal agency that did not have a contract with Clearview at the time. Asked how the agency uses the software in its policing work, a CBP spokesperson told BuzzFeed News it \\u201Cdoes not use Clearview AI for its biometric entry-exit mission.\\\" The spokesperson did not answer further questions. Since BuzzFeed News first reported last year on ICE\\u2019s more than 8,000 searches through Clearview, the agency has expanded its relationship with the facial recognition provider. ICE has said publicly that it \\u201Cdoes not routinely use facial recognition technology for civil immigration enforcement,\\u201D but it signed a $224,000 contract with Clearview last August.Clearview\\u2019s strategy of handing out free trials meant that its facial recognition software was often used without any oversight. Officials at 34 public entities told BuzzFeed News that they had found police officers or other public servants using Clearview without approval. Even more concerning, representatives at 69 law enforcement and taxpayer-funded entities initially denied to BuzzFeed News that their employees had used the software \\u2014 but after further examination, discovered that they had. Police officials in Chula Vista, California, for example, were adamant that their department did not use any facial recognition technology in its work. \\u201COur officers can\\u2019t sign up for something like that on their own,\\u201D Eric Thunberg, a captain with the organization\\u2019s investigations division, told BuzzFeed News in November.But after a more thorough search, Thunberg determined that they had. A \\u201Csmall number\\u201D of officers signed up for a free trial in 2019 and used the software to investigate threats \\u2014 like \\u201Ca photo of a kid holding a gun or weapon\\u201D \\u2014 against dozens of schools in their jurisdiction, he said. \\u201CAbsent of your inquiry, we never would have known about it.\\u201D Similarly, the Tacoma Police Department in Washington initially denied using Clearview before discovering that an officer \\u201Cin an investigative capacity\\u201D ran nearly 800 searches during a free trial that lasted from November 2019 to November 2020. Spokesperson Wendy Haddow noted that \\u201Cthe officer said there were no arrests made that he is aware of from the searches.\\u201D The Los Angeles Police Department, the nation\\u2019s third-largest police agency, banned the use of commercial facial recognition in November following an inquiry from BuzzFeed News about the nearly 475 Clearview searches that officers ran as of early last year. John McMahon, the deputy police chief who oversees the department\\u2019s IT division, confirmed that the more than 25 officers and investigators who used the software did so in ways that were \\u201Cnot authorized.\\u201D The department declined to answer further questions. In Alameda, California, BuzzFeed News found that police officers continued to use Clearview after elected leaders voted to ban the technology in December 2019. In the months before that vote, an Alameda police officer warned Clearview cofounder Richard Schwartz that the department was facing \\u201Can uphill battle\\u201D to approve a paid contact for the software. Schwartz\\u2019s reply, in an August 2019 email obtained via a public records request, denounced the \\u201Canti-facial-recognition narrative\\u201D and touted Clearview as a \\u201Cstate-of-the-art investigative tool for law enforcement that is super-accurate and 100% unbiased.\\u201D He added, \\u201CAre they really going to let politics and deliberately misleading reports prevent you from using a life-saving tool like Clearview?\\u201D (The company declined to answer questions about Schwartz\\u2019s communications with Alameda police officers.)When Alameda became the fourth city in California to ban the use of facial recognition in December 2019, some officers apparently did not heed the directive. Records seen by BuzzFeed News show that Alameda police officers \\u2014 who ran nearly 550 searches in data \\u2014 continued to use Clearview at least until February 2020, unbeknownst to city officials. The city manager and city council members, who told BuzzFeed News that the officers\\u2019 use of the software has been hard to track because of its free trials, are now investigating the matter. \\u201CNever in my job would I ever think, Oh, I wonder if I can use this and not check it with a higher authority,\\u201D John Knox White, a member of the Alameda City Council, told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CIf something is controversial, we should check in with the city attorney's office; key decision-makers should be involved to make sure there's no problem.\\u201D He added, \\u201CThat we have emails showing police used this technology after an actual vote saying you can\\u2019t do this is extremely troubling.\\u201DTon-That is an outspoken advocate for Clearview, parroting the company's marketing claims in print and TV interviews. In February 2020, he said on CNN that Clearview was \\u201C99% accurate\\u201D and compared its achievements to the breaking of the sound barrier. \\u201CIt\\u2019s gotten to the point where it works better than the human eye,\\u201D he said of the facial recognition software. But these claims have not been vetted by an independent third party, and Clearview offers no research to support them. The company\\u2019s marketing materials claim that its recognition software is 98% accurate per 1 million faces, according to the benchmark created by the University of Washington's MegaFace dataset; however, this has never been independently verified by the school. Ton-That declined to provide evidence that the technology had been reviewed by a third party but said that the company \\u201Cplans to participate\\u201D in tests \\u201Cto further validate the accuracy and reliability of Clearview AI.\\u201D The University of Washington did not respond to requests for comment. Meanwhile, representatives from multiple law enforcement agencies told BuzzFeed News that they had opted not to purchase Clearview subscriptions because the software either did not work as well as they\\u2019d expected or did not meet department standards. Dennis Natale, a detective with the Melrose Park Police Department in Illinois, which ran more than 120 searches as of early 2020, said that Clearview \\u201Cdidn\\u2019t directly affect\\u201D any of his cases. Lt. Jon Bowers of the Fort Wayne Police Department in Indiana told BuzzFeed News he didn\\u2019t recall any instance in which Clearview \\u201Cwas a lynchpin\\u201D in closing a case; he noted that his department pays for the software and uses it infrequently because it rarely returns matches on searches. Shawn Vaughn, public information officer for the police department in Texarkana, Texas, which had run more than 280 Clearview searches as of February 2020, said the agency stopped using the software after a few months because of concerns \\u201Cabout its reliability and privacy issues.\\u201D \\u201CAs far as any claims of 100% accuracy by a product, it's been my experience that those should immediately be viewed as suspect,\\u201D he said. Part of the problem, officers explained, is that Clearview doesn\\u2019t seem to work well with the low-resolution photos and grainy surveillance footage that are so common in police work. Bowers said that Fort Wayne police officers used Clearview to identify alleged rioters during a Black Lives Matter protest in late May 2020, but only because the event was widely documented in pictures and video \\u2014 something that is not true of the typical crime scene. \\u201CThe quality is often not good enough to put it in Clearview and find the [suspect in the] armed robbery from Friday night,\\u201D he said, noting that the department was reconsidering its $4,000 yearlong contract with the company.Historically, concerns about the accuracy of facial recognition systems have been particularly acute when it comes to scrutinizing the faces of nonwhite people. Technology developed by other companies has been plagued by claims of racial bias and false identifications, leading to innocent people being accused of crimes. In 2018, the ACLU reported that Amazon\\u2019s facial recognition system incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress to people who had been arrested for crimes. There are now at least three known instances of people being jailed after being falsely identified by other facial recognition tools. All three were Black men. Last June, in light of racial justice protests and further scrutiny on potential bias in facial recognition, Microsoft placed a temporary moratorium on the sale of its technology to police departments \\\"until there is a strong national law grounded in human rights.\\\" Amazon did as well for a year, saying it wanted to \\u201Cgive Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules.\\u201D \\u201CThe technology is not built to identify Black people,\\u201D Mutale Nkonde, CEO of the nonprofit communications group AI for the People, told BuzzFeed News. She noted that when facial recognition tools misidentify people of color, it amplifies dangers they already face from implicit racial bias.Ton-That has repeatedly said that Clearview is immune to such errors. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, he reiterated this claim and said that \\u201CAs a person of mixed race, ensuring that Clearview AI is non-biased is of great importance to me.\\\" He added, \\u201CBased on independent testing and the fact that there have been no reported wrongful arrests related to the use of Clearview AI, we are meeting that standard.\\u201D However, Clearview did not provide any information about that testing, despite repeated inquiries. Furthermore, while BuzzFeed News found no evidence of wrongful arrests, we learned of false positives, suggesting the software is susceptible to similar problems.Detective Adam Stasinopoulos of the Forest Park Police Department in Illinois, which stopped using Clearview after its free trial expired, said he saw false positives in search results within the facial recognition app. \\u201CI know that there were matches that weren\\u2019t exactly accurate,\\u201D Stasinopoulos said. BuzzFeed News reviewed documents in a Forest Park arrest in which Clearview correctly identified a suspect, a Black woman, in the theft of an engagement ring, yet it also matched her image with three other Black individuals who were not involved in the crime. In early 2020, a source with access to the Clearview AI mobile app conducted a series of searches on behalf of BuzzFeed News. That person, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution, ran more than 30 searches using a group of images including several photos of computer-generated faces. On two searches for computer-generated faces \\u2014 a woman of color and a girl of color \\u2014 Clearview returned images of real people as matches. For example, it matched an artificial face to an image of a real girl of color in Brazil, whose school had posted her picture to Instagram. For searches of computer-generated white faces, no false matches occurred. Clearview declined to respond to questions about these issues.In Clearview contracts seen by BuzzFeed News, the company warns paying agencies that matches should not be the sole basis for making an arrest. But experts worry that the company\\u2019s unproven claims of accuracy could encourage investigators to use a possible match and develop cases they wouldn\\u2019t otherwise pursue. Facial recognition software is so new that lawmakers and the public are only beginning to grapple with how it is used. Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat and the chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, told BuzzFeed News that as facial recognition becomes more widespread, local and federal authorities need to enforce restrictions. \\u201CAs this reporting shows, we have little understanding of who is using this technology or when it is being deployed,\\u201D he said. \\u201CI\\u2019m also deeply concerned by evidence that facial recognition technologies can be error-prone or demonstrate harmful biases, especially when used on people of color. Without transparency and appropriate guardrails, this technology can pose a real threat to civil rights and civil liberties.\\u201DPolice can easily abuse and weaponize facial recognition tools like Clearview\\u2019s, Joy Buolamwini, founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, told BuzzFeed News, regardless of whether the tool is accurate. \\u201CWe have to take the conversation beyond questions of accuracy or algorithmic bias and start focusing on questions of algorithmic harms and civil rights,\\u201D she said. \\u201CWhen these systems are used as tools of mass surveillance, the excoded, those who are harmed by algorithmic systems, suffer the brunt of overpolicing, undue scrutiny, and false arrests.\\u201D And then there is the issue of transparency. Michael Gottlieb, a lawyer for a racial justice protester who was arrested in Miami in May, learned Clearview had been used to identify his client as a suspect only after a local NBC affiliate station reported it. The Miami Police Department did not return multiple requests for comment. Similarly, for those who were arrested during Black Lives Matter protests in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the police department there declined to disclose who had been identified with the assistance of Clearview.Emails between police officers from late 2019 obtained through a public records request show some discussing whether to omit mention of Clearview AI in official reports. \\u201CWhen you write reports about identifying suspects through Clearview AI,\\u201D one officer from Springfield, Illinois, asked a peer in Gainesville, Florida, in November 2019, \\u201Cdo you name the program, etc.? Or is it better to keep it vague. I wasn\\u2019t sure if there were any issues with trying to keep the information away from suspects about how we got their information.\\u201D The Gainesville officer replied: \\u201CYou can keep it general and say \\u2018through the use of investigative techniques. It\\u2019s not going to be totally wrong if you mention it.\\u201DThe rapid development and proliferation of commercial facial recognition has left lawmakers across the country scrambling to define digital privacy and protect our faceprints. It\\u2019s also made some police departments uneasy over deploying such technology in their communities. Sheriff Rob Streck in Montgomery County, Ohio, didn\\u2019t mind that two of his detectives had tested Clearview on a trial basis, but he opted not to adopt the tool officially. \\u201CI think there are still many unanswered questions about privacy and the technology,\\\" he said. Law enforcement leaders in other states echoed Streck\\u2019s concerns. The Utah Department of Public Safety considered using Clearview AI but decided against it because it couldn\\u2019t verify how, and from where, the company was mining its faceprints, Chief Brian Redd told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CIf a company is not being transparent or not wanting to give us information as to how they are mining their data, that\\u2019s a red flag for us,\\u201D he said. \\u201COur community also had concerns about the use of their public photos, so we shut it down.\\u201DAfter testing Clearview, the Utah Department of Public Safety continued to work with state leaders on a facial recognition bill, which passed through the state legislature earlier last month. It\\u2019s not as strong as some other states\\u2019, but it does require officers to submit a written request before running a search, and only allows them to do so in a felony case or a life-or-death situation. The bill also bans state agencies from accepting free trials from private companies like Clearview. \\u201CThis is a powerful tool, and it needs accountability,\\u201D Redd said. \\u201CWhen it comes down to it, we didn\\u2019t want to be the only ones who have the power to decide how to use it.\\u201D Jameson Spivack, an associate at Georgetown Law\\u2019s Center on Privacy & Technology, said that while such guardrail policies are a good first step, they\\u2019re not worth much if they are not enforced properly. \\u201CIf you were to ask law enforcement how they use face recognition, they could just say, \\u2018Oh, it's just an investigative lead,\\u2019 which may or may not be true,\\u201D Spivack said. \\u201CThe fact of the matter is, in most cases, there's nothing holding them to this. There's, in most cases, no laws, in most cases, no internal policies. They pretty much have free rein to use it how they want.\\u201D ●Here is a link to the Document Cloud folder shown below."},{"author":"Stephanie M. Lee","title":"After JAMA Questioned Racism In Medicine, Scientists Are Boycotting","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/stephaniemlee\/jama-racism-medicine-podcast-boycott","content":"Last month, Monica McLemore and a team of scientists at the University of California at San Francisco were wrapping up research into a troubling pandemic disparity: Pregnant women of color with COVID-19 appear to be at higher risk for premature birth. It was a finding they hoped to publish in the Journal of the American Medical Association, or JAMA, one of the world\\u2019s most-read research periodicals. But their plans abruptly changed when JAMA released a podcast episode in which its host, a top journal editor named Edward Livingston, dismissed the idea that systemic racism in medicine existed. \\u201CPersonally, I think taking \\u2018racism\\u2019 out of the conversation would help,\\u201D Livingston said on the Feb. 23 show, titled \\u201CStructural Racism for Doctors\\u2014What Is It?\\u201D \\u201CMany people like myself are offended by the implication that we are somehow racist.\\u201D Online, the journal promoted the podcast with a tweet that said, \\u201CNo physician is racist, so how can there be structural racism in health care?\\u201D Those statements sparked a furious outcry from the medical community. Doctors and researchers flooded Twitter and the journal\\u2019s inboxes with demands for explanations and complaints pointing out that racism very much exists in healthcare. The Institute for Antiracism in Medicine, a Chicago advocacy group, circulated a Change.org petition that now has more than 7,400 signatures.Now a small subset of scholars, including McLemore, are taking their protest a step further. At least 10 doctors and researchers, including some who have previously published their work in JAMA, have publicly declared that they will not submit manuscripts to the journal until it addresses its failures. They say they no longer trust that JAMA has the knowledge and sensitivity to evaluate research on racial disparities, and want to see it diversify the mostly-white staff that selects which issues deserve JAMA\\u2019s enormous spotlight. Their boycott is an unusual move that could put them at great professional risk. The backlash comes at a time when institutions across America, from corporations and universities to media outlets and law enforcement agencies, are reckoning with their histories of racist actions and the persistent inequities within their ranks. Medicine is no exception. The percentage of Black physicians in the US has barely grown so far this century \\u2014 from 3.3% in 2003 to 5% in 2018 \\u2014 which doctors attribute to factors ranging from unsupportive and discriminatory work environments to a disproportionate lack of mentorship and promotions. And as countless studies have shown, health providers are statistically more likely to give Black patients worse care. Compared to white patients with identical symptoms, Black people are less likely to receive cardiac medical procedures, less likely to be treated by cardiologists for heart failure, and less likely to be prescribed painkillers. Black patients have some of the worst health outcomes of any racial group in the US, including the highest maternal and infant mortality rates. Those disparities are starker than ever today, as the pandemic takes a disproportionate toll on people of color. In medical research, few gatekeepers are more prestigious or more synonymous with the establishment than JAMA, which oversees a network of 13 journals. It is the independently operated publishing arm of the American Medical Association, the country\\u2019s leading physicians\\u2019 organization. With more than 293,000 subscribers, its flagship title claims to be the most widely circulated medical journal in the world. For clinicians and researchers, getting published in JAMA can be a ticket to securing a new job or getting promoted. \\u201CPeople\\u2019s careers have been made by a single publication in JAMA \\u2014 that\\u2019s how important it is,\\u201D McLemore, a professor who studies reproductive health and health inequities, told BuzzFeed News. And the pandemic has elevated JAMA\\u2019s profile to new heights, as audiences hungry for new coronavirus information livestreamed interviews between its editor-in-chief, Howard Bauchner, and prominent scientists like Anthony Fauci. But now the protests have become a full-fledged crisis for JAMA. Livingston stepped down from his editor role last month and, last week, Bauchner was placed on administrative leave while an independent committee conducts an investigation into how the podcast and the tweet were vetted. JAMA also said that it held a town hall with employees in March, is reviewing how all its content is created, and will hire a deputy editor with \\u201Cspecific expertise in the topics of racism and structural racism in health care\\u201D\\u2014 something that the Change.org petition had asked for. But to the scholars who are boycotting the journal, the podcast incident exposed the institution\\u2019s entrenched dismissal of race. Pledges alone can\\u2019t fix that. \\u201CIf you are bold enough or naïve enough to write a podcast and tweet that says \\u2018There are no racist physicians,\\u2019\\u201D McLemore said, \\u201Cyou can only imagine your ability, or lack thereof, to fail to understand how racism shows up in healthcare provision and the care that people provide.\\u201DThe podcast was intended as an explanation of \\u201Cstructural racism for skeptics.\\u201D That\\u2019s how Livingston framed his 15-minute talk with Mitchell Katz, who leads New York City\\u2019s public healthcare system and also serves as an editor at a JAMA journal. Livingston began by saying that he, as \\u201Ca child of the \\u201960s,\\u201D had watched the passage of federal civil rights legislation. \\u201CGiven that racism is illegal, how can it be so embedded in society that it\\u2019s considered structural?\\u201D he asked. Katz, whose healthcare system serves more than 1 million New Yorkers from culturally diverse backgrounds a year, responded that structural racism \\u201Cis not about whether someone is a racist or whether some individual person loves other people of a different ethnicity, or doesn\\u2019t like it.\\u201D Rather, he said, it \\u201Crefers to a system in which policies or practices or how we look at people perpetuates racial inequality.\\u201D He pointed to how people of color in lower-income neighborhoods receive substandard education and healthcare. In response, Livingston said, \\u201CI think the term \\u2018racism\\u2019 might be hurting us.\\u201D Livingston explained that his \\u201Cparents taught me never to hate based on what people\\u2019s colors are, or their religion, because they had suffered the most extreme violence because they were Jews, and they said that\\u2019s wrong.\\u201D They instilled him with the lesson to \\u201Cnever, ever even think about a person\\u2019s race or ethnicity when you\\u2019re evaluating them,\\u201D he said, \\u201Cyet I feel like I\\u2019m being told I\\u2019m a racist in the modern era because of this whole thing about structural racism.\\u201D To him, he said, the problem apparently \\u201Cisn\\u2019t their race, it isn\\u2019t their color, it\\u2019s their socioeconomic status.\\u201D Many people have a \\u201Cnegative\\u201D response to the term \\u201Cracism,\\u201D Livingston went on to remark, and \\u201Care turned off by the whole \\u2018structural racism\\u2019 phenomenon.\\u201D Then he asked, \\u201CAre there better terms we can use? Is there a better word than \\u2018racism\\u2019?\\u201D At the end of the debate, Livingston seemed to be as skeptical of structural racism as he was at the outset. It was, he said, an \\u201Cunfortunate term to describe a very real problem.\\u201D On Feb. 24, JAMA tweeted out the episode with the declaration that \\u201CNo physician is racist\\u2026\\u201D Thousands responded in incredulous fury. Jessica Richardson, one of the three co-founders of the Institute for Antiracism in Medicine, said that they felt \\u201Ca lot of anger at the very notion that there is no physician that is racist, and that racism is not a problem in medicine, nor can it be a problem in medicine \\u2014 when we know, as three Black female physicians, that it is a huge problem in medicine.\\u201DBrittani James, another cofounder, said that Livingston and Katz were not equipped to tackle the topic at hand. \\u201CWe\\u2019re having a conversation with two white males over whether or not racism exists,\\u201D she said. \\u201CI would expect someone with true racial literacy to try to hand the mic to someone who either has a lived experience or has dedicated their life to the work.\\u201D But, James added, she wasn\\u2019t surprised to hear prominent physicians debate the existence of structural racism. \\u201CWhat really astounded me was the fact that they did it in broad daylight, out in the open.\\u201D Overnight, the incident became a test of the American Medical Association\\u2019s public pledge to combat racism, issued last summer, weeks after the killing of George Floyd sparked nationwide Black Lives Matter protests. Discrimination haunts the AMA\\u2019s own history: For more than a century, up through the late 1960s, the medical group excluded Black physicians from its ranks, which it publicly apologized for in 2008. And it wasn\\u2019t until 2019 that the AMA hired its first chief officer dedicated to making health disparities a core part of the organization\\u2019s focus. On March 4, as the furor over the podcast grew, Bauchner apologized. The episode and the tweet were deleted. The CEO of the AMA said it was \\u201Cdeeply disturbed\\u201D by both. On March 6, the Institute for Antiracism in Medicine started its Change.org petition. By March 10, when the AMA said that an independent committee would be investigating the incident and that Livingston had stepped down, the petition had amassed a couple thousand signatures \\u2014 and a cadre of researchers were openly speaking of a boycott. \\u201CI\\u2019ve decided that I will no longer read nor submit any manuscripts for publication to @JAMA_current nor their related journals,\\u201D tweeted Uché Blackstock, an emergency physician in New York City and the founder and CEO of Advancing Health Equity, a diversity consulting firm. \\u201CTheir last tweet\\\/podcast was not a mistake. It was part of a long line of racist and harmful content.\\u201DAt UCSF, McLemore and her team were in the last stretches of drafting their paper about COVID-19 and preterm births. Based on what they believed was the largest dataset of its kind to date, they were planning to report that women infected with the virus, especially women of color, seemed to be more likely to give birth early, which is linked to higher rates of medical complications. JAMA, they thought, would be their best and biggest audience. \\u201CEspecially for someone like me, early in my career, if you have an opportunity for a paper that you think you might want to submit to JAMA, usually that\\u2019s seen, especially within academia, as a really important opportunity,\\u201D said Deborah Karasek, an epidemiologist leading the research. But after McLemore heard the podcast, she said, she told her coauthors, \\u201CY\\u2019all can take my name off that.\\u201D Instead, after a flurry of discussion, everyone agreed that McLemore\\u2019s name would stay and it would have to go elsewhere. \\u201CAt this time, [JAMA] would be the last place we would want to publish,\\u201D said a third collaborator, Laura Jelliffe-Pawlowski.Another UCSF professor, Margot Kushel, had just published a string of studies in various JAMA journals and had another in the pipeline. \\u201CWe just pulled a paper--thank you, always, for your leadership,\\u201D she tweeted at McLemore on March 7. James Lozada, an anesthesiologist who worked at Vanderbilt University at the time, relayed the news to colleagues he was working with on a study about opioid use in pregnant patients. \\u201CIn light of what had happened, they were agreeable that [JAMA] was probably not the best place\\u201D to publish, he said. Alison Gemmill, a reproductive health researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, has published two papers in JAMA journals and was working on another to send its way. Like Karasek, her collaborator at UCSF, she is in the early stages of her career, and landing a third JAMA paper would be a big boost. But once she saw that Karasek was joining a growing chorus of dissenters, she decided to follow suit. \\u201CI really wish I could send it to JAMA because it\\u2019s the ideal spot for this,\\u201D Gemmill said. \\u201CBut I\\u2019m just not going to do it.\\u201DIt is not unheard of for scholars to boycott journals. High-profile boycotts in recent years have targeted journals for business models that put scientific research behind pricey paywalls. Thousands banded together against a new machine-learning journal\\u2019s plans to charge readers, and several universities cut ties with the publishing giant Elsevier over fees that they called exorbitant. Separately, some journals have responded to criticism about published work by retracting studies that perpetuated allegedly racist ideas. When the physicians at the Institute for Antiracism in Medicine launched their petition, they started hearing from researchers who had had upsetting encounters with the journal. One said that JAMA editors, including Livingston and Bauchner, stripped their work of mentions of racism and racial disparities. According to another, the editor-in-chief told them in 2016 that \\u201Cthe word racism could not be used for fear of losing readers.\\u201D (Livingston and Bauchner did not return requests for comment.) The Institute shared a compilation of these anonymous anecdotes with more than 20 JAMA and AMA leaders last month, according to an email reviewed by BuzzFeed News. No one responded, the doctors said. JAMA declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation. The CEO of the AMA, James Madara, said in a statement, \\u201CJAMA and the AMA intend to take actions that demonstrate we are committed to dismantling structural racism both within our organization and across medicine. To do so, we must and will partner with those outside our organization who are willing to join together to confront these issues.\\u201D The podcast episode did not surprise Raymond Givens, a cardiologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, who contacted JAMA in the fall in an attempt to discuss his concerns about a lack of diversity among the journal\\u2019s staff. On Oct. 26, Givens sent a frustrated email to Bauchner, as well as the editor of another top-tier outlet, the New England Journal of Medicine, or NEJM. \\u201CThe emotional impact of this year\\u2019s events has led me to be far more vocal and candid than I have ever been previously,\\u201D began his note, which he shared with BuzzFeed News.According to a data analysis done by Givens, the staff of both journals in 2020 were each 80% white and 70% male. \\u201CI note with humor but absolute sincerity that there are more editors named David at your journals than Black and Latinx editors combined or East Asian and South Asian editors separately,\\u201D he wrote. (By his count, JAMA had 41 editors or board members who were white and eight people of color. NEJM had a similar breakdown, with 43 white editors or board members and eight who were nonwhite.) \\u201CThe fact that the gatekeepers are so unrepresentative \\u2014 by race, gender, and geography \\u2014 is unsettling,\\u201D Givens continued. \\u201CWithout more diverse views, it is difficult for you to know what you don\\u2019t know.\\u201D When asked for comment, NEJM editor Eric Rubin said that the journal doesn\\u2019t ask its editors or editorial board members to identify their race or ethnicity, but he estimated that Givens\\u2019s assessment of its racial makeup was incorrect, without specifying how. JAMA did not respond to a request for comment about this analysis. Bauchner didn\\u2019t reply to Givens\\u2019s email, and Rubin offered to talk about it but never called, the cardiologist said. Over the next few months, though, the NEJM appointed its first African American deputy editor and published an essay written by Givens about how exhausting 2020 was for Black health providers. Givens said he doesn\\u2019t plan to submit any work to JAMA anytime soon. Neither does Joia Crear-Perry, founder of the National Birth Equity Collaborative. \\u201CI don\\u2019t have faith that the current leadership would be able to navigate reviewing articles around structural racism and its impact on maternal health,\\u201D she said. Compared to other journals, she said, JAMA has been slow to make race an editorial focus. A different medical journal, Health Affairs, pledged this year to include more underrepresented voices in its pages. Last summer, the Lancet, another high-profile science journal, invited Crear-Perry to write an editorial titled \\u201CMoving towards anti-racist praxis in medicine\\u201D as part of an ongoing series of articles and commentary. These other journals \\u201Care really leaning into ensuring that they undo the harm that\\u2019s been caused by racism,\\u201D Crear-Perry said. \\u201CBut we have not been able to get the same kind of pickup from JAMA.\\u201DThe most obvious consequence for withholding research from JAMA is that it won\\u2019t be seen by the journal\\u2019s large audience \\u2014 giving even less attention to relatively understudied issues such as racial inequities. Jelliffe-Pawlowski, one of the UCSF researchers working on the COVID-19 preterm birth study with McLemore, said that one big reason that JAMA was initially attractive to them is that it has a special channel to rapidly publish short research. A lot of coronavirus findings have been released in this format, allowing scientists to quickly update the world on the ongoing crisis. \\u201CThere are not a lot of other mechanisms like that,\\u201D Jelliffe-Pawlowski said. Openly protesting such a high-profile outlet \\u2014 which many told BuzzFeed News extends to peer-reviewing other scholars\\u2019 manuscripts if asked \\u2014 could have career consequences beyond lost publications. It could also, some researchers fear, bring reputational harm. \\u201CIn order for us to promote ourselves up the academic ladder, we have to get our papers into these journals,\\u201D said Ebony Hilton, an associate professor of anesthesiology at the University of Virginia who is researching how much access racial minorities with COVID-19 have had to scarce medical equipment, like ventilators. Hilton said her team will not be submitting the final research to JAMA. \\u201CWhen you are only 5% of a population of people,\\u201D Hilton added, referring to the percentage of doctors who are Black, \\u201Cif you speak out against that population, if you speak out against that system, you are putting a target on yourself in many ways.\\u201D To some academics, even those who strongly disagree with JAMA\\u2019s actions, boycotting may feel like too great a sacrifice, or not the most effective form of protest for them personally. \\u201CFor every individual person, they need to do and respond in a way that\\u2019s empowering to them,\\u201D said Taison Bell, a critical care and infectious disease physician at the University of Virginia. That could be through signing petitions, boycotting, talking to JAMA staffers, or something else.Bell, who has previously published in a JAMA journal, isn\\u2019t planning to boycott \\u2014 though he noted that this would be less of a sacrifice for him anyway, since research is not his main focus. In a recent essay in the NEJM, he wrote about the need to create more opportunities for Black physicians in academic medicine. And he told BuzzFeed News that that effort involves rethinking the connection between promotions and \\u201Cprestigious\\u201D publications, given the lack of diverse staffing at the latter. \\u201CIt\\u2019s a much bigger discussion than \\u2018Do I withhold scholarship from this one journal?\\u2019\\u201D he said, pointing out, \\u201CThe same issues are going to be at the next journal I might be considering. For the most part, I would bet the same issues apply.\\u201DThose who are boycotting JAMA are actively figuring out what it will take to feel comfortable bringing their work to the journal again. As the internal investigation into the podcast episode continues, it\\u2019s unclear how the JAMA will come down on Bauchner, who has served as editor-in-chief since 2011. But to many, last week\\u2019s news that he was being at least temporarily placed on leave looked like a victory. \\u201CWe did it!!\\u201D tweeted James, one of the petition\\u2019s leaders. \\u201CI always believed that [since] we were on the side of right, JAMA would eventually realize that,\\u201D Crear-Perry said by email. Givens hoped that other journals would see the incident as a cautionary tale. \\u201CA group of Black physicians who are fed up banded together and helped to make this happen,\\u201D he wrote by email. \\u201CMany Black doctors, and other doctors from marginalized groups, have simply had it with medicine\\u2019s hypocrisy and resistance to positive change.\\u201D What meaningful change looks like, however, will look different to different people. On March 16, before he was placed on leave, Bauchner conducted a livestreamed interview with three Black medical experts about structural racism in medicine. It was a discussion he had promised to hold in his earlier, written apology, and he opened by again expressing regret for the journal\\u2019s \\u201Cinaccurate, offensive, hurtful\\u201D comments. But several Black scholars said that the apology \\u2014 as well as the journal\\u2019s decision to delete the episode and force out Livingston \\u2014 wasn\\u2019t enough. Like others, Givens will be paying close attention to the outcome of the investigation that is being conducted by the AMA\\u2019s independent committee. As he recently pointed out to JAMA leadership, six of the seven committee members are white. And if Bauchner ultimately steps down, Givens said he would carefully watch to see how his replacement is selected \\u2014 and how other editors are chosen going forward. \\u201CI don\\u2019t think drawing new editors from the same old small network would represent progress,\\u201D he said. \\u201CI do think the new voices should not merely [be] diverse but bold, willing to push medicine forward forcefully toward greater inclusion.\\u201D McLemore, too, is waiting for concrete signs of bigger change. Shortly after Bauchner was sidelined, she expressed concern that he would be replaced with someone who could repeat the same mistakes. \\u201CI would need to see some consistent behavior change over time,\\u201D she said. But she was hopeful: \\u201CI\\u2019m not going to sit here and say I\\u2019ll never submit something to JAMA again or review something again.\\u201D \\u201CI have to believe in redemptive narratives,\\u201D McLemore added. \\u201CI believe in repair from rupture.\\u201D ●"},{"author":"Dan Vergano","title":"CDC Pushes Back Against Critics Of COVID Death Numbers","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/danvergano\/cdc-critics-covid19-deaths","content":"Rebuking claims of inflated COVID-19 death estimates, the CDC confirmed death certificates showing that the coronavirus killed more than 375,000 Americans in 2020. COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death nationwide, after heart disease and cancer, the reports released on Wednesday found. Nearly 3.6 million Americans died overall in 2020, with COVID-19 driving a 15.9% increase in the nationwide death rate, alongside increases from heart disease, injuries, Alzheimer's, and diabetes. \\u201CSome of those \\u2018excess deaths\\u2019 are from COVID-19 and weren\\u2019t reported,\\u201D CDC National Center for Health Statistics mortality statistics chief Robert Anderson told BuzzFeed News. In the CDC\\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Report analysis, his team found that while 5.5% of COVID-19 death certificates listed the disease as the sole cause of death, 97% of the others had died of other causes that COVID-19 made fatal. Based on the health agency\\u2019s analysis, the reported number of people who died of COVID-19 is most likely an underestimate. \\u201COur findings suggest that death certificates more provide a \\u2018floor\\u2019 for COVID-19 deaths,\\u201D said Anderson. In the last 13 months, COVID-19 has killed over 550,000 Americans, with many following a post\\u2013holiday season surge. While deaths have been steadily declining since then, concerns about a possible fourth surge have led some public health officials to fear another rise in deaths. The agency\\u2019s new report was intended to address persistent concerns from some critics who have claimed that COVID-19 deaths have been overcounted. Both before and after the election, former president Donald Trump repeatedly claimed that doctors were overcounting COVID-19 deaths for financial gain, with others claiming mortality rates from the disease were exaggerated. \\\"There was some misunderstanding out there that we should only count COVID-19 deaths where that was the only cause listed on a death certificate. But that's not how death certificates work,\\\" said Anderson. \\\"This report was in part intended to answer that concern.\\\"The US has a patchwork of state and county laws governing how physicians, coroners, and medical examiners fill out death certificates. Such reports are intended to demonstrate a chain of mechanisms that cause deaths, for example, a patient with hepatitis dying of resulting liver failure. Anderson suggested that an increase in excess deaths from April last year, early in the pandemic, likely points to unreported COVID-19 deaths that make death certificate figures over the course of the pandemic an undercount. \\u201CIn particular, we saw increases in deaths from pneumonia alone that just point to the disease being unrecognized,\\u201D Anderson said. \\u201CIt\\u2019s a nice analysis, and it is good to see CDC steering things in the right direction,\\u201D said Georgia State University public health expert Gerardo Chowell-Puente, noting the agency was criticized last year for low-balling coronavirus fatality rates. Numbers of U.S. uncategorized deaths last year weren't so high as to make the CDC's death certificate estimate of COVID-19 mortality a gross undercount, said medical demographer Andrew Noymer of the University of California, Irvine. There just aren't that many \\\"excess\\\" deaths for the year in medical records to leave much room for COVID-19 mortality numbers to be much higher, at least in the US. \\\"This is a 'floor', but the ceiling isn't a lot higher,\\\" said Noymer. At a White House briefing on Wednesday, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky noted that the death figures also reconfirmed that COVID-19 has disproportionately harmed people of color in the US. Among Native American, Hispanic, and Black patients, she said, COVID-19 death rates were more than double those of white ones. \\u201CSadly, based on the current state of the pandemic, these impacts have remained in 2021, where we continue to see that communities of color account for an outsize portion of these deaths,\\u201D Walensky said."},{"author":"Caroline O'Donovan","title":"Amazon Union Organizers Look For Path Outside NLRB","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/carolineodonovan\/amazon-union-labor-violations-nlrb","content":"Amazon repeatedly violated the rights of employees who pushed for health and safety improvements during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the nation\\u2019s top labor regulator. But a year after the global health crisis began, the company has so far faced minimal consequences. As COVID-19 spread in the spring of 2020, Amazon employees in New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Arizona, Pennsylvania, California, New Jersey, and Michigan pressured the company to slow down production and ramp up precautions by organizing petitions, press conferences, and even walkouts. Some of those employees subsequently faced disciplinary action at work. A few were even fired, according to charges they later made with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the federal agency tasked with adjudicating complaints about unfair labor practices and defending workers who want to unionize. In going up against their enormous and powerful employer, these Amazon workers turned to the NLRB for protection as they exercised their legal rights to discuss problems at work and act collectively to fix them. But despite serving as the government\\u2019s primary counterweight against powerful companies restricting their workers\\u2019 labor rights, the NLRB is notoriously toothless, and in its current form, has little power to penalize employers \\u2014 especially those the size of Amazon, one of the nation\\u2019s largest private employers after hiring more than 400,000 people last year. Even when the NLRB sides with workers, the consequences, or so-called remedies, it\\u2019s able to mete out \\u2014 typically small monetary settlements, back pay, or posting a flyer \\u2014 are so minor that they do little to deter employers from violating the rules again. If Amazon workers do persevere despite retaliation and termination and successfully form a union, it\\u2019s only one shop at a time out of hundreds. \\u201CFrom Amazon\\u2019s point of view, the NLRB is not a problem,\\u201D UC Santa Barbara labor historian Nelson Lichtenstein told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CAs a remedy for employer violations of the law, it\\u2019s very weak. It can have a public role as part of a larger campaign, you can get a judgment against the company, but it\\u2019s weak.\\u201D This week, all eyes are on Bessemer, Alabama, where Amazon workers await the results of an NLRB-facilitated union election widely believed to be the most pivotal in the company\\u2019s history. Indeed, even a victory at a single facility could activate Amazon employees around the country to follow suit. But recent events in Alabama suggest the consequences Amazon has faced so far have not discouraged the company from taking a hard line against unions, and under current labor law, the government has little power to intervene. That\\u2019s why, even if the union wins in Alabama and workers embark on the long and difficult journey to winning a contract, some labor leaders question whether the best path to attaining more benefits for workers even goes through the federal agency in charge of the matter. Over the last few months, the NLRB has found merit with many of the high-profile charges brought by Amazon employees last spring, including Courtney Bowden\\u2019s claim that she was illegally terminated, Jonathan Bailey\\u2019s that he was illegally interrogated, Christian Smalls\\u2019 that he was illegally fired, and the claims by a group of workers in Chicago that they were illegally disciplined and intimidated following a series of walkouts. Of those four cases, Amazon has so far paid one individual an undisclosed settlement and agreed to post a flyer in a Queens warehouse promising not to interfere with employees\\u2019 rights to discuss workplace conditions, take collective action, and organize a union. Workers in Chicago who were disciplined for going on strike are currently negotiating the terms of a nonfinancial settlement with Amazon; Smalls\\u2019 hearing regarding his termination by Amazon has been delayed until May. Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, the Seattle-based tech workers and former leaders of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice who were fired last April following their efforts to advocate on behalf of warehouse workers, are awaiting a response to their charge with the board, which they filed last October.\\u201CEven when you win,\\u201D Lichtenstein said, \\u201Cwinning doesn\\u2019t mean that much.\\u201D Bowden reached a private settlement with Amazon and withdrew her charge, meaning there are no official consequences for Amazon. \\u201CI felt like they did the best they could with everything,\\u201D she said of the NLRB in an interview with BuzzFeed News. \\u201CBut I know it didn't hurt Amazon at all.\\u201D Amazon declined to comment on pending litigation. Regarding its settlement with Bowden, a spokesperson said, \\u201CWhile we disagree with allegations made in the case, we are pleased to put this matter behind us. The health and safety of our employees is our top priority and we are proud to provide inclusive environments, where employees can excel without fear of retaliation, intimidation or harassment.\\u201D The company denied allegations made about its anti-union behavior, saying, \\u201COur employees know the truth\\u2014starting wages of $15 or more, health care from day one, and a safe and inclusive workplace.\\u201D But Amazon\\u2019s campaign against the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union\\u2019s Bessemer organizing drive has been so aggressive that President Joe Biden made a statement defending the Amazon workers\\u2019 \\u201Cfree and fair choice to join a union,\\u201D a move by a sitting president \\u201Calmost unprecedented in American history,\\u201D according to the Washington Post. Newly appointed NLRB press secretary Kayla Blado, who has been tasked with improving the agency\\u2019s outreach, told BuzzFeed News, \\u201CWorking people should understand their rights and be able to act collectively without any coercion or intimidation from any parties.\\u201D But statistics reflect the extent of the challenge: The number of NLRB elections held in the US has steadily declined over the last five years, with the total number in 2020 \\u2014 827 \\u2014 falling to a low not seen since the National Labor Relations Act was passed in the 1930s, according to pro-union researcher Eric Dirnbach.The feeble state of US labor laws combined with the monolith of opposition presented by Amazon every step of the way has compelled some labor leaders to experiment with organizing strategies that don\\u2019t rely on the NLRB. Unsure whether the board is capable of protecting workers and ushering them toward a union, organizers everywhere from college campuses to Google\\u2019s campus have pursued alternatives such as minority unionism, where affiliation is declared by a small group of employees without a majority vote. Some Amazon employees say they don\\u2019t need a traditional affiliation at all to consider themselves a union. Some of these alternative methods make it difficult if not impossible for members to collectively bargain with management on behalf of all employees, preventing them from securing a contract that applies to everyone. But in a country where corporate profits have far outpaced wage growth and government regulators have few tools to punish employers who violate labor laws, workers are starting to decide that they need to experiment with more aggressive tactics and not place their hopes on a federal agency seemingly overmatched in its duties. Bowden said she felt validated that the NLRB found merit in her allegations against Amazon. But the final outcome of her case made one thing clear: \\u201CI don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re as strong as Amazon.\\u201DWhen Courtney Bowden applied to Amazon in 2018, she saw the job as a temporary step. She\\u2019d studied psychology at Penn State, but couldn\\u2019t go back to finish her degree until she paid off some student loans, a goal she hoped getting full-time work at Amazon could help her achieve. Though she was shocked by how difficult the job was and nearly quit after her first day, she soon found she was good at it \\u2014 and she knew better-paying work would be hard to find. As time went on, Bowden couldn\\u2019t help being critical of how Amazon treated its workers. One thing that bothered her was the fact that employees were required to park in a lot and take a 20-minute shuttle ride to the warehouse, but weren\\u2019t paid for that time. Bowden, who has never been in a union, started trying to convince her coworkers to help her pressure management to change that policy. \\u201CI realized when I was going by myself I wasn\\u2019t getting nowhere fast. The fastest way was if more people went,\\u201D she said. \\u201CI felt like it was power in numbers, and the more people, the more things we could get as a collective.\\u201D One morning in December 2019, she got a group of workers at her warehouse in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, to go to the supervisor\\u2019s office to complain \\u2014 so many participated that they delayed the day\\u2019s deliveries by about an hour, Bowden said. Shortly thereafter, management started making retroactive travel pay deposits into employee accounts. After that victory, Bowden set her sights on paid time off, aligning with Amazon workers in Chicago, Sacramento, New Jersey, and New York who, through an independent, loosely organized, worker-led network called Amazonians United, were fighting for the same thing. By the time the coronavirus became a workplace issue, Bowden was already feeling targeted by management, according to the charge she filed with the NLRB last March. Bowden said an Amazon HR representative warned her she could get in trouble for what she was doing in February 2020, and that not long after, a different manager penalized her for how she was wearing her hair, even though Bowden said she\\u2019d seen plenty of other workers wearing their hair loose below their shoulders. The final blow came in March, after Bowden had been agitating for Amazon to enforce social distancing by having fewer employees per shuttle. The company, which alleges that Bowden made verbal threats to another employee, suspended her and then terminated her employment. Bowden denies making any threats. She filed her charge with the NLRB independently, hoping that she\\u2019d eventually get her job back and prove that Amazon \\u201Ccan\\u2019t do what they did and get away with it.\\u201D But life post-Amazon proved difficult. When the state-subsidized childcare program Bowden relied on found out she was unemployed, it kicked her out. Eventually she got part-time work stocking shelves for a grocery store contractor in the early mornings, leaving her 4-year-old daughter with her mom, who was working from home. In mid-November, Bowden learned the NLRB had determined that Amazon had \\u201Cbeen interfering with, restraining, and coercing employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed\\u201D in the National Labor Relations Act and was taking up her case, according to a board filing obtained by BuzzFeed News. But her preparation for her March hearing was derailed when her mom died unexpectedly of a heart attack at home on Dec. 13.The sudden death of her mom, who was 62, left Bowden alone with her small daughter, without a job, dealing with expensive funeral preparations. When Amazon offered her a cash settlement (the amount of which she\\u2019s not permitted to share), Bowden felt she had no choice but to take it. To her disappointment, the terms of the settlement mean the company doesn\\u2019t admit any wrongdoing, and she is banned from working at an Amazon facility again. But, she said, \\u201CI don't regret it because if it wasn\\u2019t for me, 800 people wouldn't have gotten their checks.\\u201D Amazon declined to comment on the specifics of Bowden\\u2019s efforts in Pennsylvania. At a warehouse in Queens, another Amazon employee, Jonathan Bailey, said he was \\u201Cinterrogated and threatened\\u201D by management following his efforts to shut down the facility in protest of dangerous working conditions during the pandemic. He filed a charge with the board in May. When he got the news that the agency was siding with him and would require Amazon to post a flyer in the warehouse promising not to interrogate employees or interfere with organizing, he celebrated by posting the notice to Facebook, saying, \\u201CI\\u2019m proud to be a member of Amazonians New York City and fight with my coworkers for our rights!\\u201D But Bailey found the NLRB process surprisingly slow, and, after four years of then-president Donald Trump, under-resourced, he told BuzzFeed News. Seven months after he filed the charge, the NLRB regional director reviewed his allegations and decided to take action. When Bailey learned the terms of a settlement negotiated by the NLRB would result in the same outcome \\u2014 Amazon hanging a flyer in the Queens warehouse about workers\\u2019 rights \\u2014 as if he had gone to trial before an administrative law judge and won, he opted to settle the case. \\u201C[Amazon] hired this really big union-busting law firm and, you know, for them, it\\u2019s a tiny line item of their costs,\\u201D said Bailey, who is now running for public office. \\u201CThey don\\u2019t really care.\\u201D Without going through the legal process of voting to unionize, Amazonians United likely won\\u2019t be able to collectively bargain with Amazon. But Bailey feels what they\\u2019ve already been able to accomplish is just as effective as a contract. Last year, he and other workers associated with Amazonians United New York succeeded in getting Amazon to give them safe and sick leave and paid time off, benefits to which they are legally entitled. \\u201CWe have not had a union election, but we have conducted actions and we have won changes \\u2014 material changes,\\u201D he said. For Bailey, a union isn\\u2019t a legal designation but simply workers who \\u201Ccan take actions together to change the conditions in which you work.\\u201D The idea that workers themselves, not the government, should have the power to declare themselves a union, while unconventional, is growing in popularity. Members of the Chicago branch of Amazonians United have repeatedly relied on the NLRB to adjudicate whether or not Amazon has violated their rights at work, most recently when employees were disciplined following a series of walkouts over COVID-19 safety measures. Earlier this month, the board ruled in the workers\\u2019 favor in five of their seven claims, and they are currently negotiating a possible settlement. In January, Amazon announced it would be closing the warehouse, DCH1, where the organizers worked and reassigning them to other locations in the region. While Amazonians United Chicagoland says it has used \\u201Cthe NLRB and the National Labor Relations Act as tools to fight back against Amazon\\u2019s retaliation,\\u201D the group has no plans to pursue an NLRB election. \\u201CWe\\u2019re rooting for our coworkers in Alabama and we hope their and our fights inspire workers to stand up,\\u201D the group said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. \\u201CBut we\\u2019re simply building [a] strong worker organization without worrying about [union] elections.\\u201DThe outcome of the election at Amazon\\u2019s Bessemer warehouse has been the subject of intense national attention over the last few months, just as the NLRB election process has been the focus of labor organizing for the past few decades. But some union leaders, tired of a legal playing field tilted so heavily toward employers and disappointed with the agency\\u2019s failure to protect workers, are pushing for experimentation with more radical strategies. As the Teamster union\\u2019s national director for Amazon, Randy Korgan has the tough job of taking on perhaps labor\\u2019s most formidable foe in the United States. The Teamsters have organized workers in the freight, logistics, and warehousing industry for over a century, and Korgan said his main concern is finding the fastest route to what he believes is the only thing that will reverse the decline in wages Amazon has brought to that industry \\u2014 a union contract. And he doesn\\u2019t necessarily see that route going through the NLRB. Rather, he said, \\u201CThere are a lot of other ways to build worker power, as well as seek representation,\\u201D though he declined to elaborate on what the specifics of that pathway to a contract could look like. This month, as the situation in Bessemer was heating up, the Des Moines Register reported that a Teamsters local in Iowa had started organizing Amazon workers there with the goal of helping both warehouse workers and drivers seek union recognition outside the NLRB. Organizing Amazon delivery drivers is a particular challenge because they aren\\u2019t employed directly by Amazon, but by small logistics firms called Delivery Service Partners or DSPs. Amazon can terminate a DSP\\u2019s contract for any reason, including if its employees join a union \\u2014 as it did in Michigan in 2017. That strategy makes it difficult for unions to make inroads. A group called the Amazon Delivery Drivers Coalition has held small rallies and, with help from the Teamsters, filed unfair labor practice charges against Amazon and DSPs on behalf of workers at a few delivery stations throughout the midwest. There is currently a bill, the PRO Act, before the Senate aimed at strengthening the NLRB, both by increasing penalties for employers who violate the law and by prohibiting some of the anti-union tactics at their disposal. But even if this proposed legislation passes, which currently seems unlikely, or Biden appointees make other moves to strengthen labor law, some labor leaders still believe that there\\u2019s good reason to explore strategies for getting workers a union contract that don\\u2019t involve the NLRB.One alternative path, employed by the Communication Workers of America (CWA) union in campaigns for workers on college campuses and at Google, is minority unionism, sometimes called a members-only union, when a group of workers collectively decide to unionize without a majority vote. The main drawback is that a minority union can\\u2019t legally bargain on behalf of all employees, which means they can\\u2019t negotiate a contract, but a major benefit is the union can choose to represent workers like temps and contractors who Google doesn\\u2019t directly employ. In January, around 230 Google workers \\u2014 out of more than 100,000 worldwide \\u2014 formed the Alphabet Workers Union (Alphabet is Google\\u2019s parent company) under the umbrella of the CWA, and around 500 more signed on within days, according to the Verge. Detractors called it \\u201Cfake union,\\u201D and a very public snafu over a press release led some members to call for disaffiliation from CWA, underscoring the risks of moving forward publicly without a formal unionization vote. But a spokesperson for AWU says it has no plans to part ways with CWA at this time, writing in an email statement: \\u201CWe are here to work with all Alphabet workers who want to improve our workplace, whether they\\u2019re members of AWU or not.\\u201D \\u201CWinning an NLRB election is really hard and really resource-intensive,\\u201D said Rebecca Givan, a Rutgers labor studies professor. \\u201CIn some situations, workers are able to do that. But it\\u2019s not necessarily the quickest path to winning improvements on the job \\u2026 I think we\\u2019ll continue to see a lot of different approaches.\\u201D The results from Bessemer will be counted this week. Whether it\\u2019s a victory or a loss for the union, the road to a contract will be a long one. Meanwhile, Bowden is trying to move on with her life; in a few weeks, she\\u2019s planning to start a new job at a food processing facility that pays slightly less than Amazon\\u2019s widely touted $15 an hour. She hopes the process of taking her complaint to the NLRB raised awareness about the power of organizing within Amazon. But while the benefits and pay she worked for remain, with the high turnover, not many of the people she worked with are left to continue the fight. \\u201CSome of the new people just don\\u2019t know about the struggle that we had to go through,\\u201D she said. \\u201CThey\\u2019re getting the benefits that people like me had to fight for.\\u201D ● "},{"author":"Otillia Steadman","title":"Religious Extremism Isn't New To Atlanta's Sex Industry","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/otilliasteadman\/atlanta-sex-workers-religion-police","content":"ATLANTA \\u2014 There was a preacher on a megaphone calling people sinners at the sex shop Tokyo Valentino just last week, about 300 yards away from two of the three spas that would be attacked days later, in a rampage that left eight people dead. \\u201CHe wanted to yell and scream at people,\\u201D said Howard Calhoun, who was hanging out in the lobby and described himself as a regular at Tokyo Valentino, which also has video booths and adult play rooms. Calhoun said it\\u2019s not the first time he\\u2019s seen that kind of thing \\u2013 there was also a guy carrying a King James Bible and shouting about Scripture sometime last year. And there\\u2019s another guy who regularly buys a ticket to Hush Night, the weekly exotic dance show featuring trans women, so that he can come in and hand out religious pamphlets, said Lenox Love, a promoter who organizes the show and goes by a professional pseudonym. Believers with pamphlets will also occasionally stop by Onyx, a strip club about half a mile down the road from Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa, two of the locations that were attacked. Sometimes women bring gift baskets for the dancers, recalled an employee who identified herself as Y.C. \\u201CIt\\u2019s nice stuff, but they always have a note that says something like, \\u2018God will save you, not this place,\\u2019\\u201D she said. Workers in the Cheshire Bridge Road area, a neighborhood filled with sex shops, strip clubs, and spas, said it wasn\\u2019t unusual for their work to be called immoral \\u2014 they\\u2019ve grown familiar with the social judgment and legal exclusion that reflect a public disregard for their lives. The March 16 mass shooting, which targeted spas that employ Asian women, marked a horrifying escalation of the scorn people in the sex industry face, but its ingredients are deeply rooted in US culture. From the evangelical Christians trying to save dancers from damnation to the police officers cracking down on the livelihoods of people who sell sex, and anti-trafficking advocates calling for law enforcement action against spas based on racist assumptions about Asian women, some of the country\\u2019s most powerful institutions have worked to eradicate the sex industry, and in the process often put its workers in harm\\u2019s way. The Atlanta shooter, who received treatment for sex addiction at an evangelical clinic, said in his statement to police that he wanted to eliminate sexual \\u201Ctemptation\\u201D at the locations he targeted. The attacks have forced spas that offer sexual services into an uneasy spotlight, and much of the same stigma that made these victims vulnerable \\u2014 rooted in extreme interpretations of Christian doctrine and the racist hypersexualization of Asian women \\u2014 has left community members hesitant to speak about them and their work. Days after the attack, it is still unclear whether some or any of the victims were trading sex. Spa workers in the area largely declined to speak with BuzzFeed News, and those who did said that their businesses were not involved in the sex trade. As the country grapples with the toxic stew of racism, religion, and misogyny at the root of the spa killings, advocates say remaining silent about the hatred of sex workers \\u2014 who often labor in the shadows, without protection from violent clients and mistreated by police \\u2014 will only enable violence against them to continue. \\u201CWe have an opportunity to really lift a group out of a situation of perpetual violence by acknowledging this incident for what it is,\\u201D said Kate Zen, a cofounder of Red Canary Song, a New York\\u2013based organization that identifies itself as a \\u201Ccollective of Asian and migrant sex workers.\\u201D \\u201CBut we are not taking that opportunity, and it\\u2019s perpetuating that exact form of violence that made it so easy to do harm to these people.\\u201DWhen Vivika Williams heard about the attack on spas in Atlanta, she wondered how close she might have come to being targeted herself. She had once danced at Tokyo Valentino, and Williams, who also sells sex to support herself, was struck by the reports that the shooter\\u2019s \\u201Cmotive for murder was immorality,\\u201D she said, \\u201Cand he was trying to wipe out all the immorality.\\u201D Williams has faced violence in her work too, and she said she felt people were often indifferent to crimes against sex workers. One night last November, Williams made an appointment with a new client. The man said he was sending an Uber to pick her up, but it turned out to be a setup. The driver was actually delivering her to someone who attacked her, groping her and robbing her of a few hundred dollars at gunpoint. \\u201CHe could have really murdered me and threw me in a forest somewhere. But it was to God\\u2019s grace I\\u2019m still here,\\u201D she said. When Williams reported it to the police, though, she said it felt like they were blowing her off, and she thought it was because of her identity as a trans woman and sex worker. \\u201CThat\\u2019s what they gave me, like, very, \\u2018Oh, just another one of them\\u2019 \\u2014 that kind of energy,\\u201D she recalled. \\u201C\\u2018Just another transsexual.\\u2019\\u201D \\u201CThey just kind of shit on people and I don\\u2019t understand it, that\\u2019s not fair.\\u201D she said. \\u201CSex work is a job. A lawyer has a job, a construction worker has a job. Sex work is a job.\\u201D Workers at other businesses along Cheshire Bridge Road, historically a red-light district that has been gentrifying in recent years, say that the police have done little to keep them safe when they\\u2019ve called for help dealing with angry or violent customers. \\u201CI feel like [the police] don\\u2019t feel it\\u2019s a priority,\\u201D said Lisa Johnson, who works at Out of the Closet, a thrift store and HIV clinic in the neighborhood. Often, she said, the police take so long to respond that by the time they arrive, the violent customer is gone. \\u201CWe call numerous times and they don\\u2019t show up,\\u201D said Stephanie Fox, the owner of the Southern Nights sex shop. Two employees at Tokyo Valentino told BuzzFeed News about a recent occasion when they had called the police because someone was waving a gun around. About 30 minutes later, when no one had arrived, the employees called back only to discover that an officer had, in fact, been dispatched, but was across the street at a pizza parlor. \\u201CThe police officer was across the street the whole time,\\u201D said one of the employees, a janitor at the club who identified himself as J.O. \\u201CHe just never came in.\\u201D There have been two other shootings in the area recently, one by a customer at Tokyo Valentino. Chris Coleman, the manager, said he felt the police response in the neighborhood was \\u201Chit or miss,\\u201D and that officers sometimes take hours and sometimes respond quickly. He said there had been more police in the area after last week\\u2019s shootings.In response to questions about the incidents, a spokesperson for the Atlanta Police Department told BuzzFeed News via email, \\u201CWe take criminal acts, especially acts of violence, very seriously and we do not respond differently based on the victim\\u2019s race, gender or sexual orientation. We want everyone in our communities to feel safe and to know we are here for them.\\u201D In neighboring Cherokee County, Mario Gonzalez, whose wife, Delaina Yaun, was killed at Young\\u2019s Asian Massage in the March 16 massacre, told the Spanish-language news site Mundo Hispánico that he had been handcuffed at the scene by the Cherokee County Sheriff\\u2019s Office for about four hours after the shooting. He believed he may have received that treatment because he\\u2019s Latinx. The sense of police indifference to violent crimes in the area is magnified by law enforcement crackdowns on places suspected of selling sex, which is illegal in Georgia. Criminalization of the sex trade comes with its own threats of violence, at the hands of both clients and the police. Businesses in the Cheshire Bridge area, including Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa, have been the target of undercover stings and arrests. A 2019 report found that most women working in illicit spas feared arrest even more than assault or robbery. Yang Song, who worked in a spa in New York, fell to her death during a police raid, and had told family members she had been sexually assaulted by a man with a badge. Stella Zine, a sex worker rights advocate with COYOTE Georgia, said gentrification in the Atlanta area has contributed to hostility against the sex industry, leading to brutal raids on gay bars and strip clubs, and legislation that aimed to ban sex work in certain areas. Zine said she worked at multiple clubs in the area in the \\u201990s, and that there were several times she was afraid she would be hurt, but \\u201Cat the time I didn\\u2019t even think calling the police was an option.\\u201D Spa businesses that offer sexual services face particular criminalization, often at the behest of anti-trafficking advocates, who claim they are hotbeds of human trafficking. One anti-trafficking organization is already calling for Atlanta police to investigate connections between the shooting and the global sex trade. Such spas often employ women who emigrated from countries in Asia, but Zen said the association between the spas and trafficking is itself the product of anti-Asian racism, which stereotypes Asian women as submissive and labels them as victims. \\u201CPart of the rationale that\\u2019s given is that Asian women are somehow\\u2026culturally more needing of protection. That\\u2019s an extremely racist assumption,\\u201D said Zen. \\u201CThis victimization narrative is required in order to justify rescue.\\u201D The 2019 report, which Zen contributed to and was based on interviews with more than 100 Chinese and Korean women working at illicit spas in New York and Los Angeles, found that while some had been coerced or deceived, most had chosen the work as the best of very limited options. Not all spa businesses are engaged in illicit activities, and for officials and civil rights advocates responding to the attacks in the midst of rising anti-Asian violence, the association with sex work has been thorny. Racist stereotypes connecting Asian women to the sex trade have a long history in the US, dating back to at least 1875, when the Page Act excluded Chinese women from immigrating to the country over assumptions that they would be prostitutes. That same fetishization and hypersexualization now contributes to violence against Asian women broadly, advocates say. \\u201CIt\\u2019s stereotyping that Asian women working in those [businesses] are easily understood as sex workers or undocumented,\\u201D Su Choe, an organizer with the Korean community in Atlanta for Asian American Advocacy Fund, told BuzzFeed News. After the attacks, Choe said she had heard about more harassment of Asian people in the Atlanta area, including one incident in Duluth where someone came into a restaurant and started screaming about \\u201Cmassage.\\u201D One of the women killed in the attack, Xiaojie Tan, owned Young\\u2019s Asian Massage. A friend and client told USA Today that the business didn\\u2019t offer any sexual services, and he had been seeing Tan for a stiff neck. Some of the victims may very well have been sex workers, though, and attempts to avoid that fact \\u2014 like Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms\\u2019 statement that she wanted to avoid \\u201Cvictim-blaming\\u201D \\u2014 tend to reiterate the stigma against sex work. \\u201CThis idea that sex work is wrong \\u2014 it\\u2019s only victim-blaming if there\\u2019s something to be blamed inherently in sex work, and it\\u2019s scary because it requires a perfect victim to acknowledge that this is a form of violence,\\u201D said Zen. Even in the aftermath of the attacks, while much of the country was mourning the killings of eight people, allegedly by a man who told police he was motivated by religion, the ideas at the root of his hate continue to persist. At a rally in Atlanta denouncing the violence at the spas last week, a witness present recalled one man walking by shouting that the women who died were sinners who should get real jobs."},{"author":"Pia Peterson","title":"Photos Of WW2 Japanese Internment Camps In The US","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/piapeterson\/japanese-detention-photos-anti-asian-racism","content":"At a time when the Asian American community is facing an increase in hate crimes, it\\u2019s crucial to confront the long legacy of racism within the United States. One of the most glaring examples is the incarceration of Japanese Americans by the federal government, which began after the Pearl Harbor attack and continued throughout World War II. Tōyō Miyatake was a photographer who was incarcerated at the Manzanar War Relocation Center in California in 1942, one of 10 detention camps. He had purchased his own photography studio in 1923 in the Little Tokyo section of Los Angeles. Back then, still life art photography was his first love, according to his grandson Alan Miyatake, who maintains his grandfather\\u2019s photography studio today. At the time of the incarceration, Tōyō Miyatake decided that as a photographer, it was his duty to document what was happening to his community. He smuggled a lens and a film holder into the camp, and he built a camera himself. \\u201CAt some point in that first year, he showed his son Archie (my dad) the camera and told his son that it was his duty to document this in the hopes that it will never happen again,\\u201D Alan said. \\u201CIn the family\\u2019s early days at the camp, he was photographing scenes around the camp only at sunset and sunrise, so he wouldn\\u2019t be seen,\\u201D Alan said. Other photographers working for the US government and the Works Progress Administration came to the camp as well \\u2014 most notably the photographers Ansel Adams and Dorothea Lange. Both photographed Manzanar as a part of their work documenting America for the WPA. Miyatake and Adams had been friends in the photography world before Miyatake was incarcerated. According to Alan, the men who ran the detention camp were big fans of Adams\\u2019 work for the Sierra Club, and through Miyatake\\u2019s connection with Adams, he was eventually appointed the official photographer at Manzanar. We\\u2019ve collected a series of images below that chart the experience of Japanese Americans during that period. For more photography stories like this, and a full interview with Alan Miyatake about his grandfather\\u2019s life and legacy at Manzanar, sign up for our newsletter below."},{"author":"Venessa Wong","title":"Anti-Asian Violence Shatters The Myth Of Invisibility","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/venessawong\/asian-american-invisible-hate-crimes","content":"Jason Wang already had plenty of problems from the pandemic. He\\u2019d closed several locations of his family\\u2019s popular Chinese restaurant chain, Xi\\u2019an Famous Foods, laid off staff, and been trying to think of new sources of revenue when no one in New York was dining out \\u2014 before his employees started getting punched in the face. One of the workers was a man who was attacked coming to work, leaving him with broken glasses and a swollen face. The other was a woman, on her way home, who suffered a cut lip and bruised nose. \\u201CThey were just traumatized,\\u201D Wang said. \\u201CThese attacks are happening in broad daylight.\\u201D Wang and I spoke the morning after a Malaysian man was randomly beaten in an attack outside a subway station. Wang said he had started shopping for bulletproof apparel. Would he need protection against a 9 mm bullet or a .44 Magnum, or perhaps even a rifle shot, he wondered. \\u201CHopefully no one\\u2019s aiming at me with a rifle,\\u201D he said. Two weeks after we spoke, six Asian women were shot dead in Atlanta.Like Wang, many Asian Americans are grappling with heightened anxiety about their personal safety and the bleak sense that no matter how many people are punched, shoved, knifed, hospitalized, and even killed, people continue to question whether a wave of hate crimes is really happening. There\\u2019s been a silent history of violence against Asian Americans for generations \\u2014 including my own family. The pandemic and former president Donald Trump\\u2019s racist rhetoric about the \\u201Ckung flu\\u201D have unbottled anti-Chinese sentiment that marks the latest chapter of racism against Asian people in America. A steady drumbeat of reports of harassment and attacks over the past 12 months has forced communities of people who have traditionally kept their heads down and tried to quietly trudge forward to realize that keeping a low profile is not enough to ward off hate. \\u201CWe\\u2019ve been taught our entire life to just fit in,\\u201D Rep. Grace Meng said at a rally against anti-Asian hate in Manhattan last month. \\u201CJust be quiet. Don\\u2019t speak up. Be invisible; if you are invisible enough, you will be seen as American. But we are saying that we will be invisible no more.\\u201DMeng\\u2019s call for action came less than 48 hours after another Chinese man had been stabbed in the back with an 8-inch knife in an unprovoked attack on the border of Chinatown. The suspect in the stabbing turned himself in and said coldly, \\u201CIf he dies, he dies. I don\\u2019t give a fuck.\\u201D Ralliers cried for justice. When Noel Quintana stepped up to the mic, the crowd quieted down. Quintana, 61, was easy to recognize: His face had been sliced open with a box cutter on his way to work one morning a few weeks earlier, and the wound \\u2014 which rips across from the far end of one cheek, under his nose, to the opposite end of the other cheek \\u2014 was still fresh. Quintana hasn\\u2019t been able to sleep, he later told me. When he goes to bed each night, his mind can\\u2019t seem to get to that fleeting moment of peace that allows a person to submit to rest. The attack happened on Wednesday, Feb. 3, nearly a year into the wave of violence. Quintana, an immigrant from the Philippines, was in a hurry since his coworker wasn\\u2019t able to go in that day. Headed to his job at a nonprofit in Harlem, he hopped on an L train crowded enough that there were no seats left and stood at the door. A young man approached Quintana and suddenly started kicking his bag. He moved it, but within a few minutes the man began kicking his bag again. \\u201CWhat\\u2019s wrong with you?\\u201D Quintana asked as he moved away. And that\\u2019s when the young man quit kicking the bag so that he could slash Quintana\\u2019s face with a blade. Quintana doesn\\u2019t know for sure if his attacker was motivated by racism; he didn\\u2019t say anything explicitly racist. But as far as Quintana can tell, he was the only Asian person in the train car that morning. \\u201CMy eyes can\\u2019t deny it,\\u201D he said. Nearby passengers gasped. \\u201CWhen I put my hands on my face, it was so bloody,\\u201D he said. \\u201CI asked for help, but nobody helped me.\\u201D No one alerted the conductor, or called 911, or used their phone to take a video. \\u201CNobody even said, \\u2018How are you?\\u2019\\u201D So Quintana exited the train, fearful he would die from the loss of blood, which was soaking his shirt and dripping over his pants and shoes, and stumbled to the station booth, looking for anyone willing to help so he wouldn\\u2019t have to live this nightmare by himself. \\u201CWas it because they don\\u2019t want to be delayed for work? Was it that they don\\u2019t care? I couldn\\u2019t grasp what happened to people during the time,\\u201D he told me. The cops came, then an ambulance. He stayed at the hospital overnight. When Quintana returned to the hospital two days later to remove his stitches, he suffered an anxiety attack that left him unable to breathe and his body numb. He spent 24 hours in the ER for observation. By the end of February, people around the country had reported nearly 3,800 firsthand accounts of verbal and physical harassment against Asians (including in the workplace) since the start of the pandemic to Stop AAPI Hate, a group that formed last year to track incidents and advocate for human rights protections. Another study of police data found that hate crimes targeting Asian people had more than doubled in 2020. The attackers were Black, Latinx, and white. A growing cry from Asian communities to label incidents like Quintana\\u2019s as \\u201Chate\\u201D has less to do with whether an incident is prosecuted as a hate crime and everything to do with asking American society \\u2014 people, government, media, advocates \\u2014 to acknowledge that Asian people are being hurt by hate and racism, and to do something about it. Quintana told me he is fine with the fact that there is no hate crime charge in his legal case because of the difficulties in proving bias, but he does believe his attack was an act of hate and that people were indifferent to it as it unfolded. It\\u2019s hard in a situation like this not to feel utterly invisible in the absence of help, which is a painfully familiar sentiment to many Asian Americans who feel few people really give a fuck about the racism we\\u2019ve experienced, both during the pandemic and long before that. Perhaps it\\u2019s because there are people who don\\u2019t really believe that Asian people are targeted for their race. People who believe the model minority myth that claims Asian people are a monolith that overcame discrimination. Or maybe there are just too many people who refuse to help an Asian person. When Rep. Meng introduced a symbolic resolution last year asking \\u201Cpublic officials to condemn and denounce anti-Asian sentiment, racism, discrimination, and religious intolerance related to COVID-19,\\u201D 164 Republicans voted against it.After a white man killed eight people, including six Asian women (four were Korean), in Atlanta-area spas on March 16, law enforcement told reporters the suspect gave no indicators that these attacks were racially motivated and suggested instead that the suspect had a sex addiction, as if to rule out the possibility that someone who killed six Asians was racist by alluding to a racist stereotype of Asian women. Maybe some will always wonder if the shooter noticed he was killing Asian women at a business called Young\\u2019s Asian Massage. When it comes to anti-Asian racism, skeptics have demanded a greater burden of proof. It\\u2019s as if people are saying: There must be some other explanation \\u2014 let\\u2019s calm down and not add fuel to the flames. Skeptics caution that victims and advocates are too quick to suggest these incidents are racially motivated. When police killed 19-year-old Chinese American Christian Hall on a highway in Pennsylvania, people could only wonder whether race had anything to do with his death. Skeptics challenge the severity of anti-Asian racism and get tangled in the legalities of what defines a \\u201Chate crime\\u201D when people are being violently attacked, unprovoked. They say firsthand accounts of harassment are unreliable. I don\\u2019t understand how people still hold on to the idea, after the unbelievable year we just went through, that racism only exists when there\\u2019s an explicit verbalization of it. It\\u2019s in the atmosphere. This reluctance to recognize how pervasive anti-Asian racism is has only allowed this strain of race-fueled hate to fester. If these skeptics adjusted their focus ever so slightly, I thought, it would be clear to them too.\\u201CI think the lack of understanding, the lack of seeing it as an issue, is really just because it\\u2019s so normalized,\\u201D Jason Wang said. \\u201CEveryone thought it was almost a joke that Chinese people would feel racism.\\u201D Only now \\u2014 after the pandemic and the thousands of reported incidents of anti-Asian harassment this year, after the light the Black Lives Matter movement has shined on racism \\u2014 does Wang feel experiences like his have a chance of being taken seriously. In instances when the assailants have been Black, some people \\u2014 including Asians, including advocates, including even victims \\u2014 have been wary about stoking anti-Black racism by calling attention to the attackers. From the moment Asian people arrived in America, they have tried to assimilate into a system in which Black people are oppressed. In the competition for American opportunities, debates over education inequities, police enforcement, and community preservation have often pitted Asian and Black people on opposite sides. During the 1992 LA riots, 2,300 Korean-owned businesses were looted or burned down after a Korean convenience store owner fatally shot a Black teen. In a country where racism is often discussed in binaries, many in Asian diasporas are unsure how they fit in, rendering them silent and making this wave of racist violence hard to process. I hope things change. At the rally in Manhattan last month, I saw Black and Asian attendees pursuing a way forward that focuses communities on supporting each other in the broad commitment to anti-racism. As I watched the protesters shout for justice and for some modicum of recognition of this struggle, I couldn\\u2019t help but feel angry at people who try to repress our pain by asking us to silently, internally litigate whether or not a crime is truly hateful \\u2014 to minimize the scope of the problem by recasting this wave of attacks during the pandemic as a mere collection of single, random incidents with no common thread except that the victims were all Asian and the attackers were not. How do you tell people to efface their pain, that their most valuable contribution to this moment is to swallow their fear? Asking victims and their advocates not to say \\u201Chate crime\\u201D feels to me like a reincarnation of the insult thrown at Asian people over and over again in this country: \\u201CLearn English.\\u201D It\\u2019s a message I\\u2019ve internalized so deeply that while writing this story, I considered referring to all the Asian people I spoke to by their first names through the piece \\u2014 names that may be easier for English speakers to pronounce, like Jason and Noel \\u2014 rather than by their last names, as is the convention in news reports. Would that make it easier to follow along, to digest what people are saying, if they are identified by Western first names rather than Asian last names? Will Asian names subtly distract a reader? They might. But in the end, I couldn\\u2019t bring myself to deracialize something so core to identity as a name, mainly out of respect. We learned English, but we can\\u2019t obscure our heritage.I had arrived at the rally in Manhattan that afternoon with a stash of masks and hand sanitizer and a dull fear that something violent would happen. I was there as a reporter, but acutely aware that, as a second-generation Chinese American raising children of my own, I also had a direct stake in the issue at hand: the safety of Asian communities. I asked participants who were Asian like me why they were there: \\u201CIt\\u2019s disturbing,\\u201D one person said. Another felt she had to do something besides posting on social media. One man said he felt targeted. In some way, we were all there for the same reasons, and grappling with the same stew of distressing emotions. When I met Winton Tran at the rally, he said he had been unable to sleep. He recalled a time last year when he was on the subway when someone said, \\u201CGo back to your country! Go back to China!\\u201D Tran tried to make a video of his harasser, but the man blocked his face. When he called the police, he got more questions than support. \\u201CIt\\u2019s sad that people don\\u2019t pay attention until you get killed, not when you\\u2019re being harassed.\\u201D As a result, Tran said, \\u201CI\\u2019m fearful for my community. I\\u2019m fearful for friends.\\u201D Even though we had just met, he said he is even fearful for me. \\u201CI\\u2019ve connected with you, Venessa, the reporter. And I would hate to wake up one day to hear the news that this reporter got attacked, or something happened to her because I didn\\u2019t try to do something.\\u201DTran is running for City Council to represent a diverse district in Brooklyn that includes large Asian communities. \\u201CI need to do my part,\\u201D he said. \\u201CNobody is listening to you.\\u201D I think I understand what Tran means. I have a recurring nightmare that I am screaming in a panic \\u2014 it\\u2019s not always clear why \\u2014 but I can\\u2019t get any sound out, no matter how hard I strain or how wide I open my open mouth. And because no one sees how terrified I am, I am terrified alone. It\\u2019s just a dream. But I can\\u2019t help but wonder now if anyone would help me if I one day found a box cutter on my face too. Brooklyn resident Melissa Liu told me about an incident in the laundromat when an unmasked person came up and said, \\u201CYou\\u2019re avoiding us as if we gave you the virus, but you\\u2019re actually the one who gave it to all us.\\u201D No one intervened. Liu stepped outside to de-escalate the situation, worried it would turn into physical violence. But it\\u2019s no longer clear where Liu would feel comfortable doing something as mundane as laundry. People have been harassed or worse while doing daily chores, commuting, working \\u2014 simply being out in public. This terror is one that Asian people have largely borne alone, on top of all the other terrors that have engulfed the country since 2020. And in a year when the national outcry over racism finally rang clear, many feel the media has been quick to move on from anger erupting in Asian communities, reducing it to isolated flashes of outrage. A bevy of elected officials, including Mayor Bill de Blasio and Attorney General Letitia James, showed up at the rally to express support. \\u201CRise up! Rise up! Rise up!\\u201D the crowd chanted with Sen. Chuck Schumer. Was this just another flash of outrage? When I looked over this crowd of people who were moved enough to come out to support Asian communities on a damp winter day in the middle of a pandemic, I felt a rare moment of strength after a year of feeling completely powerless. It wasn\\u2019t the largest protest by any stretch, but it was a hopeful sign. It\\u2019s why Noel Quintana wanted to tell his story. \\u201CI can\\u2019t do anything about my face anymore,\\u201D he told me. \\u201CBut at least now I can still contribute to the safety of other Asians, Asian Americans, not only here in New York but around the country and probably around the world.\\u201DFear and a sense of being overlooked by both law enforcement and bystanders is galvanizing Asian Americans to mobilize in different ways. Some Asian Americans are purchasing guns for the first time, with no training on how to use them. One person commented on social media, \\u201CWe citizens need guns of our own as cops don\\u2019t care.\\u201D It\\u2019s hard not to wonder what could go wrong from here. Various volunteer block watches have also sprung up in response to the violence. Karlin Chan formed the Chinatown Block Watch in New York last year, when incidents of harassment were being reported. He\\u2019s helped to diffuse a few incidents of verbal harassment, through which he realized a sad truth about the assailants. \\u201CThey realize that you speak English, and they back down,\\u201D he said. \\u201CMost of these people are cowards, and they pick on the vulnerable.\\u201D What\\u2019s become clear during the pandemic is how, untreated, the sentiment that underlies the quieter, more mundane expressions of racism can evolve into physical violence. Esther Pang, the board chair of Hollaback, an organization that aims to \\u201Cend harassment \\u2014 in all its forms,\\u201D launched a bystander intervention training on anti-Asian harassment that has been attended by 15,000 people so far. \\u201CA huge part of it,\\u201D Pang explained, is \\u201Ctalking about how contextually speaking, historically speaking, the disrespect and harassment against Asian Americans have always been there.\\u201D To help people recognize it better, the organization describes harassment on a \\u201Cspectrum of disrespect\\u201D ranging from not listening and favoritism on one end to humiliating jokes to verbal and physical assault on the other end. \\u201CPeople might not think much about microaggressions, but...it can progress from one thing to another.\\u201D What Pang finds \\u201Cheartbreaking\\u201D about Noel Quintana\\u2019s experience is that no one acknowledged it while it was happening. \\u201CAnd I think acknowledgment is a way to reduce part of the trauma,\\u201D Pang said. None of this was something Quintana thought he\\u2019d have to deal with when he arrived in Los Angeles from the Philippines at age 47 to get his master\\u2019s degree in international business. He had a good job in the Philippines as an accounting manager, he said, but the work was stressful and a colleague convinced him to give the United States a shot. It wasn\\u2019t easy. He didn\\u2019t have a car in LA so it was hard to have much of a life, he said. Quintana would walk back home at night, since his classes ended after the last bus home departed. \\u201CSometimes I was the only one walking in the streets and I would scream, \\u2018Ahhhhhh!\\u2019 What did I do with myself?\\u201D He moved to New York when the economy was in the pits of the Great Recession and found part-time work as a barista. He\\u2019d read articles about laid-off bankers who found themselves in similar jobs and appreciated finding a new life that was less toxic. \\u201CI liked it, and there was no more pressure,\\u201D he said. \\u201CEspecially during Christmas, when you\\u2019re preparing coffee, and it smells like coffee as it\\u2019s snowing outside. It feels so relaxing.\\u201D That was long ago. Thinking back on his decision to move to the United States, Quintana said, \\u201CI don\\u2019t think I have any regrets.\\u201D And in spite of the scar he now carries from living in a country that is violent to so many, when Quintana thinks of the American dream, \\u201Cthe pursuit of happiness, justice, and equality,\\u201D he said, \\u201CI still believe in it.\\u201DBefore Jason Wang\\u2019s family started Xi\\u2019an Famous Foods, in 2005, they were in Xi\\u2019an, China (pronounced shee-ahn). Wang lived in Michigan and Connecticut and went to college in St. Louis before settling down in New York, and he described daily racism as \\u201Ca given\\u201D growing up as the only Asian person in some small towns. Even though 22.3 million Asian people make up more than 6% of the US population, in at least 40% of US counties, fewer than 1% of residents are Asian, according to estimates from the Census Bureau\\u2019s American Community Survey. \\u201CI was punched in the chest. I was pushed against the lockers. I was in fights because they were making fun of the food I was having. All these things happened,\\u201D said Wang, now 33. Trump\\u2019s rhetoric may have worsened anti-Chinese sentiment, but it was already \\u201Ceveryday life\\u201D well before 2016, he said. Anti-Asian racism is deeply rooted in American history. Discriminatory laws restricted Asian immigration, excluded Asians from citizenship, land ownership, and employment in most industries, and prohibited them from marrying white people. Ordinances outlawed Chinese hairstyles and methods of carrying groceries. In San Francisco in the 1870s, Chinese people were regularly robbed and beaten to the point that they had no residential option outside of Chinatown. In LA in 1871, a mob lynched 15 Chinese people and destroyed and looted homes, but the sentences of the eight convicted rioters were overturned on \\u201Clegal technicalities,\\u201D according to Syracuse University law professor Mary Szto. By 1940, \\u201Conly two residential districts in Los Angeles permitted \\u2018Orientals.\\u2019\\u201D \\u201CAlthough today they may seem like quaint tourist attractions, Chinatowns arose because of discrimination,\\u201D Szto wrote. My parents met 50 years ago in Manhattan\\u2019s Chinatown, a vibrant enclave where poor young Chinese singles could gather with people who shared their particular joys and struggles, away from judgment. It offered a haven not only for safety, but culture as well. My family, like so many, worked for low wages in laundries and restaurants when they arrived in the 20th century because that was the work Chinese people were allowed to do in America. It took generations living in poverty or on the edge of it here for my family to establish itself, so that eventually I could grow up in a middle-class household in the outskirts of Brooklyn with the privilege of agonizing over what I wanted to be when I grew up.I cringe when I remember the time my former boss\\u2019s friend told me the most surprising thing about living in China was realizing that Chinese people don\\u2019t all look alike, and I just quietly listened in a state of shock. Ask any Asian American about how they\\u2019ve experienced racism and you\\u2019re almost guaranteed to hear a story about racial slurs, eye-pulling, smelly lunch ridicule, mocking accents, and other manifestations of race-based bullying that we have sadly become accustomed to. Some people tell us Asian people are ugly; some say they simply don\\u2019t date Asians. We regularly get confused for another Asian person. Other times, it feels like being sidelined: that sense of being socially and professionally invisible that more Asian people have started talking about, dealing with the fact that people assume you have nothing to say when they never even bother to ask. Even though I grew up in whiter neighborhoods, I regularly returned to Chinatown: My family\\u2019s culture \\u2014 in all its dimensions \\u2014 was central to this part of the biggest city in America, not marginalized to a few square feet of the \\u201Cethnic foods\\u201D aisle. I hope the neighborhood survives for my children too. That food, which Asian kids have been mocked for in cafeterias across the country, would eventually be the foundation of Wang\\u2019s successful business, which was featured in Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations and lauded by critics, and grew to 14 locations. But then in February 2020, Wang watched sales at his restaurants begin to slump as news about the novel coronavirus made people worry about going out to eat. The Trump administration had just imposed travel restrictions on people who had been to China, where almost all of the 71,000 cases of COVID-19 had been reported by mid-month. Asian people around the world were reporting racist harassment related to the virus, and were berated with insults like \\u201Cyou dropped your coronavirus\\u201D and \\u201Cdiseased bitch.\\u201D On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. On March 13, Trump declared a national emergency to control what he\\u2019d soon call the \\u201CChinese virus\\u201D and \\u201Ckung flu.\\u201D (When CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang asked why the president used these racist terms, former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany brushed off the concerns. He continued to deploy them throughout his term.) On March 14, in Midland, Texas, Bawi Cung was in the meat aisle of a Sam\\u2019s Club with his children when he was punched in the back of his head. Then a knife ran across his face. The attacker ran off, only to return moments later to slash Cung\\u2019s 6-year-old son across his face and ear and wound his 2-year-old son\\u2019s back. That same day, New York City confirmed its first death from COVID-19, shortly after declaring a state of emergency. Jason Wang closed down all 14 Xi\\u2019an Famous Foods locations. \\u201CI was just like, OK, well, if you don\\u2019t have a reason to go out, let\\u2019s just not go out,\\u201D he said. \\u201CObviously, besides the virus, there\\u2019s also the hate virus, the attacks, so let\\u2019s just stay home. Let\\u2019s just be safe.\\u201D One attack followed another. In April 2020, a woman in Brooklyn suffered serious burns after someone poured acid on her. An 89-year-old Brooklyn grandmother was set on fire by two teens in July. That same month, a family dining out in Carmel Valley, California, was harassed by a tech CEO who unleashed a racist rant that included calling them \\u201CAsian pieces of shit.\\u201D In August a woman, nearly 9 months pregnant, was punched in the face and called racial slurs in Philadelphia. A California restaurant owner found the g-word graffitied across her business one morning in December. This year, an 84-year-old Thai man in San Francisco died on Jan. 30 after his head hit the pavement when he was pushed. In February, a 91-year-old man was shoved to the ground in Oakland\\u2019s Chinatown by an attacker who went on to push a 60-year-old and a 55-year-old to the ground, sending them to the hospital for their injuries. A man in Rosemead, California, who was beaten with his own cane lost the tip of his finger. A 52-year-old woman was knocked unconscious in Queens. A US Air Force veteran was beaten in LA\\u2019s Koreatown. \\u201CIt just felt like these attacks were happening every day,\\u201D said Wang, who was watching this crisis unfold in his community as he dealt with his company\\u2019s own crisis.Wang had started shipping chili oil and meal kits during the lockdown to generate some revenue, although it wasn\\u2019t nearly enough. When restrictions were lifted, he gradually reopened restaurants one by one, renegotiating deals with his landlords. By October, Wang had reopened eight locations, mostly as a labor of love \\u2014 he lost $97,000 that month alone, mainly \\u201Cbecause of the rent,\\u201D he said. The company received loans through emergency relief programs, but \\u201Cat the rate that we\\u2019re burning through it, we ran out of that pretty quickly,\\u201D he said. As the vaccine rolls out, Wang hopes things at Xi\\u2019an Famous Foods can turn around soon. Until then, Wang continues to evaluate line items as small as $100 to see if there\\u2019s any way to cut back even further. \\u201CIt\\u2019s just really squeezing those pennies at these times,\\u201D he said. He looks over his shoulder more than he used to when he walks around the streets of New York. \\u201CI feel like I need to be prepared,\\u201D he said. \\u201CAnd I feel like this is the new status quo of living.\\u201DSeveral times a year, my family visits my great-great-grandfather\\u2019s grave, a small, cinder block\\u2013sized headstone up on a hill in a cemetery in Brooklyn, and I wonder what his life here was like. Recently, I\\u2019ve also wondered what he\\u2019d have to say about the attacks happening now, nearly a century after his death. My family was in and out of the United States for years and treated like \\u201Csecond-class citizens\\u201D before they eventually settled here, I\\u2019ve been told. My great-great-grandfather died in New York decades before my mother was born on the other side of the world in China, and decades more before I would be born in the city where his life ended.The story is that my great-great-grandfather died after falling onto the train tracks in New York City around the time of the Great Depression \\u2014 my mother says he was pushed. That\\u2019s what my great-grandmother told her when she was a teen. The first time my mother told me about his death, I also was a teen, too young to fully understand why it might matter. I don\\u2019t know how his Chinese name was written in the alphabet, so I don\\u2019t know how to begin to research it. But a story like that sticks with you. I\\u2019ve wondered over the years if great-great-grandpa was shoved by a racist, if he was the victim of a hate crime. Were there bystanders who ignored him, like Noel Quintana? Did he think this was happening to him because he was Chinese? I\\u2019ll never know. So many details about my family were lost in the migration, fallen through the cracks between generations, as it goes in many immigrant families. This is why it is important to me, and to so many other Asian people, to create a historical record of hate now. For so long, we\\u2019ve thought keeping our heads down, being invisible in America might help us gain acceptance \\u2014 but racial invisibility is a myth. Not knowing whether these crimes were motivated by racism, trying to glaze over that possibility only preserves the myth of invisibility. And it makes it too easy to move on without making anything better. To know is to shatter that myth. For my family, it\\u2019s too late. Still, this moment of tragedy in my family has transcended time, whispered in brief from one generation to the next, like a warning to always be careful. ● Scott Pham contributed reporting to this story."},{"author":"Dan Vergano","title":"West Virginia Limits Needle Exchange Amid HIV Outbreak","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/danvergano\/west-virginia-hiv-needle-exchange","content":"A dangerous HIV outbreak gripping Charleston, West Virginia, comes just as the state is trying to dismantle one of the most effective ways to stop it: needle exchanges. Undercover police officers have run stings on a volunteer group that distributes clean needles from parking lots in the city\\u2019s neglected west side. And lawmakers are moving not just to outlaw the program, but to criminalize it. \\u201CI\\u2019ve been here 25 years, and this is the biggest problem like this I\\u2019ve seen here,\\u201D said clinical pharmacist Christine Teague. She helped spot the city\\u2019s HIV outbreak while volunteering with Solutions Oriented Addiction Response (or SOAR), the needle exchange group now at the center of the state\\u2019s legal fight. The outbreak has spread to 50 people, most of whom are intravenous drug users. The stunningly high HIV rate is now alarming public health experts nationwide. \\u201CThe outbreak is the most concerning HIV outbreak in the United States at this time,\\u201D Demetre Daskalakis, the HIV prevention chief at the CDC, said in an email to BuzzFeed News. \\u201CIt is possible the current case count represents the tip of the iceberg.\\u201D Last month, Daskalakis spoke to the Charleston City Council about the outbreak, explaining that the textbook public health response would be to increase needle exchanges. Instead, the West Virginia state legislature has moved to block such programs. Last week, the state senate passed a bill, now under consideration in the state\\u2019s House of Delegates, that would give local sheriffs final say over needle exchanges, require the tracking and returning of every needle, and impose criminal penalties for operating without a license \\u2014 a restriction aimed directly at shutting down SOAR. Public health experts say the bill is extremely dangerous and comes at a time when needle exchanges are needed most.\\u201CTwo of the four largest HIV outbreaks in the country are here in West Virginia, and that is the background in which they are trying to shut these programs down \\u2014 ongoing rapid transmission of HIV,\\u201D said epidemiologist Robin Pollini of West Virginia University, pointing to another recent outbreak in nearby Cabell County. The state has had a decadeslong problem with illicit drug use that started with overprescription of pain pills, leading people addicted to opioids to start injecting heroin, fentanyl, and methamphetamine. Long controversial as an intervention that \\u201Cenabled\\u201D drug use, needle exchanges gained acceptance amid an overdose epidemic that killed more than half a million people nationwide in the last decade. The Trump administration endorsed the programs as a public health measure in 2019. The Charleston health department shut down its own needle exchange in 2018, spurring SOAR to take its place. The West Virginia health commissioner who called for its certification to be suspended, Rahul Gupta, is reportedly under consideration to become the Biden administration\\u2019s \\u201Cdrug czar,\\u201D drawing fire from public health experts critical of his approach to the opioid epidemic.Home to 178,000 people, Charleston and its surrounding county now have a higher rate of new HIV cases among people who inject drugs than New York City, according to the CDC. The outbreak is another sign of the US\\u2019s ongoing problem with opioid-related diseases, made worse by a pandemic that\\u2019s led to record overdose deaths and hobbled public health departments. \\u201CIt\\u2019s a public health disaster,\\u201D said epidemiologist Gregg Gonsalves of the Yale School of Public Health. Closing needle exchanges, like Charleston did in 2018, likely contributed to the new HIV outbreak, he suggested. \\u201CEpidemics like this don\\u2019t come out of nowhere.\\u201DAs the pandemic started, SOAR volunteers quietly distributed needles and the overdose-reversing drug, naloxone, said the group\\u2019s co-leader Joe Solomon. On the city\\u2019s west side, where nearly 30% of properties are abandoned, they gave out clean needles from their cars, then moved to grocery store parking lots until they were chased off by police. Finally, the program turned to its current location, a Unitarian church parking lot. \\u201CThis is all driven by the pandemic. We had to find a way to help people,\\u201D Solomon said. The group also tested people for HIV, spotting some of the first signs of the current outbreak. From August to October, eight of the 120 HIV tests they administered came back positive. \\u201CFor a city this size, that\\u2019s huge,\\u201D said Christine Teague, who administered the tests for SOAR and serves as the medical director of the Charleston Area Medical Center\\u2019s HIV center. Teague quickly notified the city and state about the cases. But in October, the group became the subject of local TV news reports that portrayed its efforts as suspicious, Solomon said. At the same time, the city police department began an investigation, dispatching informants and undercover officers to request needles.A Jan. 12 police report investigating SOAR\\u2019s efforts called its motives \\u201Cunknown\\u201D and concluded that it giving each participant 30 clean needles, along with naloxone and disposal containers, \\u201Ccondones the use of illegal substances\\u201D and \\u201Cincreased the probability of used needles being discarded rather than disposed of properly.\\u201D The report also noted that the group had given an HIV test to an undercover cop at one of its weekend needle exchanges. In an almost comic ending, the police report concluded that the group could not be prosecuted because it was not selling needles and because a city law requiring that needle exchanges be state-licensed was unenforceable since the state did not offer licenses. The police did not reach out to the group for their investigation. Charleston\\u2019s chief of police did not respond to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News. Nationwide, there are more than 300 needle exchange programs, which typically provide clean needles and naloxone to people who use intravenous drugs. Decades of public health research show that needle exchanges limit outbreaks of HIV, hepatitis, and other illnesses among IV drug users, cutting the risk of these diseases by an estimated 50%. Nevertheless, their legal status in many states is still contentious. West Virginia is one of many states where politicians have tried to restrict them, often citing complaints about needle litter where they operate. Sherri Young, executive director of the Charleston health department, told BuzzFeed News that the city\\u2019s now-shuttered needle exchange program was \\u201Cvery damaging to the community, damaging to the health department.\\u201D She added, \\u201CI don\\u2019t feel like the community feels like they want us to be part of the needle service.\\u201D Young cited a city survey of fire, police, and public works personnel released on Monday, which showed that 17% of respondents reported being stuck by needles at some point on the job. More than 80% said they felt that exchanges should require a one-for-one needle return and disagreed that there was a need to expand syringe services. The survey only drew responses from about 33% of those asked to complete it, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported on Tuesday. Instead, in response to the HIV outbreak, Young last week announced that the health department would expand testing, including a mobile van intended to reach people \\u201Cliving in abandoned houses and under bridges.\\u201D People who test positive for HIV will have housing assistance offered to them, she said, but the health department will not offer needle exchange services, despite what the CDC\\u2019s HIV prevention chief, Daskalakis, recommended. \\u201CI\\u2019m concerned about that, but I do have to follow the direction of my board and I do have to remain within the law,\\u201D Young said. The new bill\\u2019s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Eric Tarr, a physical therapist, read aloud from the police investigation into SOAR in his testimony about the bill, using it to argue for more law enforcement oversight of needle exchanges. Tarr claimed drug use in the state was attributable to shoddy recovery homes that \\u201Cimport IV drug users into West Virginia.\\u201D He argued that rather than reducing disease, needle exchanges promote crime, though studies have shown this is false. Last year, Tarr pushed a bill attempting to outlaw needle exchanges altogether. Now, he said, he supports creating licenses for exchanges overseen by the police, offering an amendment to his bill to give sheriffs veto power over programs and requiring patients to enroll in recovery programs to receive bar-coded needles. The bill looks likely to pass in some form since Republican lawmakers hold a supermajority in the state legislature.Public health experts who spoke with BuzzFeed News fiercely opposed the bill, arguing it would effectively block needle exchanges from operating and could lead to a bigger HIV outbreak, as initially happened in Indiana in 2014. In that state, then-governor Mike Pence resisted allowing needle exchanges for months as a dangerous HIV outbreak spread in a southern county. The basic biology of drug addiction means that people who are physically dependent on opioids will inject them to avoid withdrawal symptoms whether there are needle exchanges or not. Providing people with clean needles is a cheap intervention when compared with the $510,000 per person it takes to treat patients with HIV. And it stops outbreaks: When Indiana started offering people clean needles and access to recovery programs in 2015, HIV cases in the affected counties dropped by 75%. \\u201CWe are not pleased with the direction this bill is taking,\\u201D said Laura Jones, executive director of the Milan Puskar Health Right clinic in Morgantown, West Virginia, which runs a needle exchange in that city, one of more than a dozen in the state. \\u201CThe whole idea is meeting people where they are at, so they learn they can trust you, and seeing a substance use disorder as a health problem \\u2014 not something for the county sheriff to oversee,\\u201D Jones added. \\u201CIt\\u2019s like making every diabetic account for every needle they use.\\u201DMultiple components of the West Virginia Senate bill go against the CDC\\u2019s best practices for needle exchanges, said West Virginia University\\u2019s Pollini, such as the one-for-one needle return (impractical for people experiencing homelessness, whose possessions are regularly lost, stolen, or impounded), the requirement that participants sign contracts to receive needles (a high hurdle for people who are scared of being arrested), and law enforcement\\u2019s authority over the programs. \\u201CThe foundation for the opposition is just a very poor understanding of the science, or resistance to the science altogether,\\u201D Pollini said. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources did not respond to BuzzFeed News\\u2019 request for comment on the HIV outbreak.As SOAR continues to distribute needles and conduct HIV tests, the group\\u2019s volunteers are now taking civil disobedience training in anticipation of the state outlawing their efforts. In a letter to the Charleston City Council in February, the head of the other needle exchange on the city\\u2019s east side supported requirements for a one-for-one needle return policy. It adopted the policy after the city\\u2019s own program closed, but more people use SOAR\\u2019s needle exchange program on the west side. The east side program was \\u201Ca model that was started out of necessity, and I think it is time to revisit,\\u201D said Teague, who is affiliated with both sites. \\u201CIt\\u2019s clear we are not meeting the needs of the community, or we wouldn\\u2019t have the outbreak.\\u201D Meanwhile, as needle exchanges grow nationwide, similar disputes have flared up in California and Washington state. \\u201CIt\\u2019s easy to beat up on West Virginia, but this is a nationwide problem, and these kinds of disputes are happening all over the country,\\u201D Leo Beletsky, a public health law expert at Northeastern University, told BuzzFeed News.The complaints about needle litter in these places and in Charleston are very real, Beletsky said, but fixing that problem by outlawing needle exchanges is misguided. The HIV outbreak and the needle litter problem both point to a need for wider needle exchange services, Beletsky said. Exchanges should be open all week and after working hours, which can help reduce crowds, with more places to dispose of used syringes. Lawmakers should also stop criminalizing needle possession, he added. \\u201CIf I\\u2019m going to be arrested or hassled for having needles, of course I\\u2019m going to get rid of them everywhere,\\u201D Beletsky said. \\u201CIt\\u2019s not rocket science to find a way to make it easy and safe to dispose of syringes.\\u201D Public health studies have suggested that there are other ways to help address community concerns about needle litter: increasing numbers of public syringe disposal boxes, giving workers needle-proof gloves, and having businesses put out sharps bins collected regularly by public health workers. For Teague, the most troubling thing seen in the uproar is that some people in Charleston are discounting the lives of the people living with HIV and struggling with drug use. \\u201CThese people are really terribly sick in lots of ways,\\u201D she said. \\u201CThere's just a kind of head-in-the-sand approach that we\\u2019ve seen in the pandemic that if we pretend it\\u2019s not happening, it will go away,\\u201D Beletsky said. Getting rid of needle exchanges to stop needle litter \\u2014 a byproduct of bad laws and an epidemic of substance use disorders \\u2014 makes the same mistake. \\u201CIt\\u2019s the same thing with intravenous drug users \\u2014 \\u2018If we just make life as difficult as possible for people we don\\u2019t like, they\\u2019ll go away,\\u2019\\u201D he said. \\u201CThat\\u2019s magical thinking, and it never works.\\u201D ●"},{"author":"Emmanuel Felton","title":"The Capitol Police's Annual Report Is One Page Long","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/emmanuelfelton\/capitol-police-report-one-page","content":"In the weeks since Trump supporters successfully breached the Capitol building, Capitol Police officers, lawmakers, and government watchdogs have been demanding more transparency from the Capitol Police \\u2014 widely seen as the most secretive department in the country. But new research provided to BuzzFeed News by Demand Progress, a progressive advocacy group, outlines how the department\\u2019s latest public report is even less transparent than those released in previous years. The study raises questions about what, if any, commitment department leaders have to instituting reforms in the wake of their failures during the Capitol insurrection. Veteran officers told BuzzFeed News that leadership problems have plagued the agency for years \\u2014 but it was only when their bosses were caught unprepared during the Jan. 6 attack that the top brass was no longer able to keep that dysfunction from public view. \\u201C[Transparency] would improve this department on every level,\\u201D one officer told BuzzFeed News after the attack. \\u201CWe\\u2019re paid by the taxpayers \\u2014 they should be able to access anything that goes on within this department within reason.\\u201D Unlike any other department in the country, the Capitol Police doesn\\u2019t have to comply with public information requests. That leaves the public largely in the dark about what is going on inside a department with a half-billion-dollar budget and over 2,000 employees. The only public-facing document the agency produces is its Annual Statistical Summary Report on Office of Professional Responsibility investigations. The agency does not provide the report online. According to the department\\u2019s website, requests for it must be submitted in writing and mailed to its office. The annual report usually runs just one page long. It lays out how many allegations were made in the past year, how many cases were opened, and how many allegations were sustained after internal investigations. In previous years, the annual report has broken down who made the complaint into four categories that distinguish between complaints from members of the public, allegations made by members of other law enforcement agencies, internal complaints, and complaints made anonymously. This year, the department created a new \\u201Cdepartment investigation\\u201D category but didn't include a definition of what exactly that term meant. In 2020, there were 106 cases, 18% of which were the result of internal complaints. In 2019, there were 228 cases, 82% came from internal complaints. For over a decade, internal complaints have represented the highest number of allegations \\u2014 but in 2020, the new, undefined \\u201Cdepartment investigation\\u201D category accounts for the majority. The department did not respond to questions about what the new category means or why it was introduced. The bare-bones nature of the report and the fact that the categories have been changed make public efforts to hold the department accountable next to impossible, said Amelia Strauss, a policy adviser at Demand Progress. \\u201CWe don't know what the nature of the complaints are,\\u201D said Daniel Schuman, policy director of Demand Progress. \\u201CWere they serious? Were they not serious? We have no idea because they won't tell us. \\u2026 They feel no desire to answer questions, even though it\\u2019s one of the biggest police departments in the country. They just don't care about that transparency.\\u201D Schuman added, \\u201CWhat we\\u2019ve seen over the decades with the Capitol Police is that they're the least accountable security force in the country.\\u201D A spokesperson for Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who chairs the Senate Rules Committee, which has oversight power over the agency, told BuzzFeed News that their office has been pushing for the department to release more information because \\u201Cincreased transparency is a major piece of accountability.\\u201D Rep. Jennifer Wexton struck a similar note during a House Appropriations Committee hearing on the department\\u2019s failure to protect the Capitol on Jan. 6. \\\"The United States Capitol Police is notoriously opaque,\\u201D Wexton said. \\u201CYou guys have had zero public press conferences in your department in the nearly two months since the attack.\\u201D During the hearing on Feb. 25, Wexton, who represents Serena Liebengood, the widow of Capitol Police officer Howie Liebengood, who died by suicide in the wake of the attack, pressed acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman to commit to at least holding a press conference. Pittman declined this request. \\\"Clear and accurate information from law enforcement is essential to our efforts to get the answers we need about the January 6th attack,\\u201D Wexton said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. \\u201CInstead, what we have seen is a failure of leadership, a failure to be transparent, and a failure to take responsibility.\\u201D"},{"author":"Pia Peterson","title":"Photos Of Asian Americans Protesting Violence For Months","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/piapeterson\/photos-protest-asian-americans-against-violence","content":"Since the pandemic was declared, thousands of Asian Americans in the US have been victims of hate incidents.

She was relieved vaccine doses had finally arrived to protect those who remained. But when she showed up at the Indian Health Service clinic in Wewoka, the capital of the Seminole Nation, staffers refused to give her a shot. They told her that she wasn\\u2019t eligible because her tribal ID card identifies her as a Freedman, a Seminole citizen who is a descendant of enslaved Black people. When she demanded answers, staffers called over a tribal police officer. \\u201CIt\\u2019s a terrible day to find out that your own people will let you die,\\u201D said Osborne-Sampson, who sits on the Seminole Nation\\u2019s tribal council. While tribal leaders and the Indian Health Service have been hailed for successfully rolling out COVID vaccines across the country, Osborne-Sampson is one of six Freedmen who told BuzzFeed News that the Seminole Nation has denied them vaccines, health services, and COVID financial relief based on the ancestry listed on their tribal ID cards. Freedmen make up roughly one-eighth of the Seminole Nation\\u2019s nearly 20,000 citizens and are counted in the tribal census \\u2014 which the federal government used to allocate over $16 million in CARES Act funds to the tribe. The distinction between a \\u201CNative American\\u201D and a \\u201CFreedman\\u201D relies on what Freedmen call a racist and outdated ideology of \\u201Ccitizenship by blood.\\u201D All Seminole Freedmen receive tribal ID cards that read \\u201CFreedman citizen, 0\\\/0 Indian blood\\u201D on the front and \\u201CVoting benefits only\\u201D on the back. Other tribal citizens receive cards that list their blood quantum (their fraction of \\u201CIndian blood\\u201D) with no restrictions. Documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News show that the Seminole tribe has used these ID cards to deny Freedmen access to COVID health and financial services. Indigenous communities across the country have been hit hard by the pandemic, with Native Americans and Alaska Natives dying at more than twice the rate of white people in the US \\u2014 higher than any other racial or ethnic group. But for Freedmen, decades of exclusion from their local tribal health services have left them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 \\u2014 the same kind of disparities experienced in Black communities across the US. In early March, shortly after BuzzFeed News began reporting this story, the Wewoka clinic changed its policy to offer vaccines to anyone over 18, regardless of tribal status. But the IHS allocates vaccines to the clinic based on the number of active patients \\u2014 and since Freedmen are not eligible for any healthcare through the Seminole Nation, they were not included in the tallies determining how many vaccines the clinic receives, the agency confirmed to BuzzFeed News. In response to questions about why Freedman citizens of the Seminole Nation were denied vaccines at the Wewoka clinic, the IHS said it was \\\"coordinating closely with tribes and the state of Oklahoma to ensure that vaccines reach Indian Country as quickly and equitably as possible.\\\" Asked about Freedmen being excluded from services other than the vaccine, the IHS said it is \\u201Cnot involved in determining tribal enrollment of individual citizens.\\\" The Seminole Nation did not respond to multiple requests for comment from BuzzFeed News. In a public statement on Friday, Seminole Nation Chief Greg Chilcoat said, \\\"The United States Indian Health Service is the entity in charge of administering Covid-19 vaccinations to the Seminole Nation, and it is the Nation\\u2019s understanding that such vaccine dissemination is being administered entirely consistent with federal law and policy in providing such vaccinations.\\\" He added, \\\"Any allegation that the Seminole Nation is denying access of the Covid-19 vaccine to a group of people is entirely false.\\\" Osborne-Sampson and other Freedmen leaders have been fighting for full rights from and recognition by their tribal governments for decades. Now, they say, the stakes are even higher. \\u201CI don\\u2019t want my name in lights,\\u201D Osborne-Sampson said. \\u201CI want my place at the table so our people can survive.\\u201DDora Thomas, a Freedmen elder and former member of the Seminole Nation\\u2019s tribal council, and her son, Patrick Thomas, a commercial truck driver who is fighting his recent removal from the council, applied for COVID emergency financial relief from the tribe last summer. Both were denied assistance, according to letters the Seminole Nation\\u2019s COVID-19 Emergency Assistance Committee sent them: \\u201CThe review committee has determined that you are ineligible to receive funding under the Program because you do not hold a valid Tribal Membership card for the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma.\\u201D Dora and her husband were hospitalized with COVID-19 in January, and both were placed on ventilators. He died about two weeks later while she was in a rehab facility. As a Freedman, Dora was not eligible for healthcare through the Seminole Nation, so she went to the state to receive public insurance. The next month, Patrick called to see if he and his mother could get vaccinated through the tribe. He was told they were not eligible. \\u201CThey hate us that bad,\\u201D Patrick said. \\u201CWe\\u2019re stuck in a system that doesn\\u2019t care about us.\\u201D Until March 1, the Wewoka clinic\\u2019s vaccine policy prioritized the health of \\u201Cby blood\\u201D citizens, making exceptions for Freedmen who live with \\u201CNative Americans,\\u201D according to a phone recording reviewed by BuzzFeed News. Anthony Conley, a member of Seminole Nation\\u2019s tribal council, called the Wewoka clinic in February to see if Freedmen were eligible. A representative said the clinic did not \\u201Chonor the Freedmen\\u201D \\u2014 but if they shared a household with or were a caretaker for a \\u201CNative American,\\u201D they would be eligible. Despite the policy change, because of these experiences, Conley, Patrick, Dora, and Osborne-Sampson said they no longer want to get vaccinated at the Wewoka clinic.Blocking vaccine access is the latest chapter in a long fight over Freedmen disenfranchisement. The Seminole Freedmen are descendants of formerly enslaved Black people who escaped to what is now Florida. After fighting together in the Seminole Wars in the 19th century, both Freedmen and Seminole Native Americans were forced to move to Indian Territory in modern-day Oklahoma. In the 1866 treaty the Seminole Nation signed with the US, Freedmen and their descendants were recognized as equal citizens within the tribe. But a series of legal fights since then have pitted the tribe \\u2014 whose leaders assert their sovereign right to determine their own membership \\u2014 against the Freedmen. Despite heavy fines from the federal government and a series of lawsuits, which established that Freedmen were considered full tribal citizens, many say they are still being denied services and treated as second class.The tensions between the Seminole Nation and the Freedmen reveal the complicated and often overlooked racial dynamics within many tribes. Cherokee Freedmen, after a series of court cases, were affirmed as full citizens in 2017 and now receive full health and financial services. In February, the Cherokee Nation Supreme Court removed the term \\\"by blood\\\" from its constitution and laws. Freedmen of the Chickasaw, Creek, and Choctaw tribes are not considered citizens and are not eligible for any tribal services. Seminole Freedmen, meanwhile, sit in the middle: Though they are tribal citizens who can vote in elections and have representatives on the council, they still don\\u2019t have access to health or financial services. The Freedmen controversy gained renewed attention last year after Gary Batton, chief of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, wrote House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a letter resisting a provision in a housing bill that would compel tribes to grant Freedmen full citizenship. In the letter, Batton wrote that the provision would \\u201Csubjugate the sovereignty\\u201D of the Choctaw Nation. \\u201CCongress should not be permitted to abuse its power by forcing the Choctaw Nation to fix America's longstanding problems of systemic racism rooted in America's enslavement of African Americans,\\\" Batton wrote, though the Choctaw Tribe also previously enslaved Black people. Osborne-Sampson thinks anti-Freedmen tribal leaders hide behind sovereignty as an excuse for their own racism. \\u201CI thought sovereignty was building up the nation, not tearing it down,\\u201D she said.After hearing stories of other Freedmen being denied the vaccine, many Seminole Freedmen aren\\u2019t bothering to try to get access through the tribe. Sache Primeaux-Shaw wasn\\u2019t willing to put her 85-year-old grandmother through the humiliating process of being denied healthcare by her own tribe, she said. Instead, after some searching, she was able to find a vaccine appointment for her grandmother at a Black-owned clinic in Oklahoma City. Primeaux-Shaw, a Freedmen genealogist and historian, was enrolled as a Seminole Freedman at birth. In grade school, however, she switched her enrollment to her mother\\u2019s tribe, the Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma, which provides full tribal benefits and services to all its citizens. That means she can now access healthcare benefits that her grandmother, a citizen of the Seminole Nation, cannot. \\u201CI don\\u2019t want her to die being a second-class citizen,\\u201D said Primeaux-Shaw, who believes that anti-Blackness within the five tribes has gotten worse over the last decade in response to Freedmen\\u2019s increased advocacy efforts. Marilyn Vann, the president of the Descendants of Freedmen of the Five Civilized Tribes, has been organizing for years. Her group has been spreading awareness of Freedmen history and advocating for them to be granted equal citizenship in their respective tribes. Vann, a retired engineer at the US Department of Treasury, is also a candidate for Cherokee Nation Tribal Council. \\u201CWhen Jim Crow ended, the sky didn\\u2019t fall down. It\\u2019s not falling down now,\\u201D Vann said, referencing when Cherokee Freedmen were granted full citizenship. She believes it is time for the other four tribes to follow suit, especially as the pandemic devastates the Freedmen community. \\u201CAs long as people are oppressed, the whole community is weaker.\\u201D Meanwhile, Freedmen groups across Oklahoma are organizing to get their elders vaccinated. Sylvia Davis, a Seminole Freedmen and former tribal council member, said that trying to work with tribal leaders has gotten them nowhere. So Davis, Osborne-Sampson, and the Seminole Freedmen say they are raising money to fight the exclusions in court. Osborne-Sampson was reluctant to go outside the tribe with their affairs but said the crisis has left them with no choice. While they raise money for legal costs, Freedmen leaders are organizing rallies and working to educate others on their history in the hopes of galvanizing the community. They also plan to make Freedmen exclusion an issue in the upcoming Seminole elections this summer. Despite their losses, Freedmen leaders are hopeful that the pandemic will be the spark that finally gets them their rights. But as cases continue to spread, Osborne-Sampson said she worries that will come at too steep of a cost: \\u201CHow many of us will be left in another six months?\\u201D ● Joseph Lee is an Aquinnah Wampanoag writer based in New York City."},{"author":"Kate Bubacz","title":"Photographer's Raw Take On His American Hometown","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/katebubacz\/nick-meyer-the-local","content":"After the last year, we've all had a chance to reflect on what home means, and for many people, it's not always the most comfortable place to be. Nick Meyer, a New England-based photographer, has recently come out with a book, The Local, that is explicitly about his hometown \\u2014 but it\\u2019s also a bit about yours. His work captures subjects that are familiar to many: issues with addiction, housing insecurity, an overall sense of small-town decline. It also opens up questions about what it means to love a place and what we owe each other. Meyer, who is from a relatively privileged background, is admittedly biased \\u2014 and his work will likely not be purchased by the local tourism board anytime soon. He offers a raw take on where we are as a society and the issues we need to examine more closely. This act of observation is both painful and powerful. While it is something of a rite of passage for young photographers to explore their hometown, there is also a long list of legends whose work has shaped how we view ourselves, sometimes for the better. Meyer himself put together a zine to raise money for people experiencing homelessness while working on this book, after an encampment was set up in front of the town hall. \\\"That project gave me a lot of clarity about what this book is and how I was going about it,\\\" he said. Meyer spoke with BuzzFeed News by phone and email to talk about his book, which local residents have complicated feelings about.How would you describe area? It is really important for me that this is represented as a region more than as a town. It's varied, and the pictures themselves are looking at one side. If you\\u2019re driving down Route 2, which goes through Massachusetts, it's a fascinating drive. A length of it is the Mohawk Trail, which the Native Americans would use as a trade route. By the middle of the 20th century, it became America\\u2019s highway. It was one of the early roads that people would use for road trips. It's still pockmarked with these really kind of racist Indian trading posts that were tourist attractions. Route 91, another road that crosses through here, is known as the \\u201Cheroin highway.\\u201D It\\u2019s also referred to as the \\u201Cacademic corridor\\u201D because it goes through all these colleges. That was one thing that was interesting to me, that there are these two sides to this place. From one to the next, the socioeconomic makeup of each town is almost completely different. So you\\u2019re trying to show the underside? I wouldn\\u2019t even call it an underside, because it's right there. Most of the pictures I'm taking are on the main streets. I'm not doing anything spectacular here like some hard-hitting investigative journalism. It's all in front of us, and that's what I mean by this ignored side. And it\\u2019s something that I do. I go to the co-op and get my organic food and walk right by some of these issues that are part of the makeup of not just this place but really anywhere. This book was a way for me to contend with that and face my position and what my own status here is. For a lot of photographers, it's where they tend to go, but for me that was where I needed to go, that side that felt ignored to me.Can you spell out some of the issues and themes you chose to highlight? Growing up here, being from a place, and the idea of home were [themes that were] driving me, but I was also focusing on some of the other political and social issues that affect most smaller towns these days. The opioid crisis passes through here. A highway runs through this area, and its used to move drugs from the south to the north. There is the fact of post-industrialization \\u2014 there were a bunch of tool factories and paper mills, but all that sort of stuff was basically gone by the time I was 7 years old. The factories that were in these small towns once gave them more economic stability and jobs, so I was looking at that, but not so explicitly, because I wasn\\u2019t going into the factories. Those are the two social driving forces. I'm trying to highlight that this is home, and that home has its flaws and it can be anywhere. There are these sides to every town that we just pass over and write off. The title is a reference to \\u201CPaterson\\u201D by William Carlos William, where in that poem he\\u2019s writing about the city of Paterson in New Jersey and the character who is wandering around his familiar surroundings, discovering what it means to be from somewhere. So I liked the fact that it can have two meanings \\u2014 the local as the person and the local as the place.Do you consider this work to be a documentary? I think that photographers, especially in this day and age, are really struggling with that term, myself included. Looking at the world and responding to it, which is how we were trained to be photographers, it's not the most popular way to work right now, at least as far as gallery sales go. It definitely is not photojournalism. I don\\u2019t pretend to have any photojournalistic integrity, because I don\\u2019t think it's possible to really do that. Using the term \\u201Cdocumentary\\u201D lends this sense that I'm trying to tell a certain truth, that I'm an unbiased observer. And that's not what I'm trying to do. The thing that I really like about photography and something that I've always been enamored by is its inability to tell the truth. Even a photojournalist, they can't always tell the truth. It's always going to be this one person's view. Every picture has a before and every picture has an after, and these infinite possibilities can happen within a book like this. It really comes down to how those pictures are put together and the narrative that comes up, and it comes back to the photographer, which is why I feel that the term \\u201Cdocumentary\\u201D is really hard to digest. While I'm photographing real things in the real world, the bottom line is still the very subjective approach of my own. This area is not a wasteland, and I've been very explicit about that. It's still New England. We still have tons of tourists. There is still foliage. There are restaurants in town. It's not all post-industrial depression here, but it is here, and that's what I'm looking at. As a documentarian, I would have to include [everything], but I\\u2019m not. I don\\u2019t actually have a good term for what it is that I'm doing.How do you want viewers to interpret this work? The bottom line would be that people see the book because it itself is different from a few images splashed here and there, and it reads differently. In putting the book together, I am thinking a lot about how a poem works with a certain flow to it. I want people to look at the book with the feeling of moving through a town, which may be melancholy, may be heartbreaking at times, but still feels respected and seen. I want the viewer to feel immersed in that. That would be my goal. The criticism is that it's looking at this bombed-out postwar town. There is that side of it, but my hope is that I convey a love and respect for the place. I feel more connected to this place now than I did before. I feel more aware of everything. I have a better understanding of where I am and what it means to be here. I have a lot of privileged information in that. I got to meet and talk to a lot of people I would otherwise have passed by. I got a lot of really wonderful and powerful and poignant stories, and those moments have really lasted with me. It's through a personal lens I'm trying to convey the sense of any hometown, but in this case it is my hometown. Any final thoughts? What I really hope is that people do the work to understand it's not meant as an indictment at all. It's meant as something much more benign \\u2014 that this is just life happening, and it's good and bad. It can be hard; it can be heartbreaking, but it's there. And I hope people have that experience of wandering and looking and seeing and sort of slowing down."},{"author":"Stephanie M. Lee","title":"Los Requisitos De Identificación Pueden Excluir A Residentes Vulnerables","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/stephaniemlee\/los-requisitos-de-identificacion-vacunas-covid19","content":"Para leer esta historia en inglés, haz clic aquí. Miguel es un trabajador de la construcción indocumentado que vive a las afueras de Miami, y que a diario lucha por demostrar su propia existencia. La policía lo acosa, le exige un documento de identidad con el que no cuenta. Sin dicho documento, no puede abrir una cuenta de banco ni solicitar un medicamento con receta en la farmacia. Y ahora también significa que no se puede vacunar contra el coronavirus. Luego de que los titulares de prensa denunciaran que un puñado de foráneos habían viajado a Florida para vacunarse, el estado declaró en enero que pondría fin al \\u201Cturismo de vacunas\\u201D. Para recibir la inyección, los habitantes tendrían que presentar documentos que acreditaran su residencia en ese estado. Solicitar una identificación oficial serviría para que las escasas dosis se distribuyeran entre aquellas personas que más las necesitan, de acuerdo con funcionarios y proveedores de gobierno, y sirve también para reducir las disparidades raciales y de ingresos en una campaña de vacunación que, hasta ahora, ha beneficiado de forma desproporcionada a personas ricas y blancas. A veces, sin embargo, estas reglas terminan excluyendo justo a aquellas personas que se busca proteger. Miguel, de 68 años, pidió que se omitiera su apellido por temor exponer su estatus migratorio; lleva viviendo en Florida más de 30 años, cuando llegó de Colombia, pero, dado que no tiene documentos, declaró a Buzzfeed que lo han rechazado dos veces de un centro de vacunación, a pesar de estar dentro del rango de edad para la vacuna. Miguel es una de las personas elegibles para la vacuna a quienes se les ha negado el servicio, pues los centros de vacunación han determinado que no han sido capaces de demostrar su identidad o residencia en el estado. En algunos casos, según halló Buzzfeed News, se rechaza a personas elegibles incluso cuando presentan documentos que se adecuan a los requerimientos del centro de vacunación, lo que pone de manifiesto un rompecabezas de políticas inconsistentes y a veces arbitrarias en los centros. Si bien las autoridades impusieron requisitos de identificación con el propósito expreso de hacer una distribución más equitativa de las vacunas, al mismo tiempo crearon barreras para muchas poblaciones de alto riesgo, incluyendo migrantes indocumentados, adultos mayores que no conducen automóviles, y personas en situación de calle. En respuesta a los incidentes aquí descritos, Walgreens, Albertsons, y el departamento de salud del condado de Los Ángeles dijeron estar revisando sus políticas de vacunación para asegurarse de que no se rechace a personas elegibles. \\u201CSe pide un documento de identificación para recibir una vacuna porque se asume que todo mundo tiene uno\\u201D, dijo Kat Calvin, fundador de Spread the Vote, una organización sin fines de lucro enfocada en ayudar a las personas a obtener identificaciones oficiales con fotografía y lograr que puedan votar. Hasta un 11% de las personas adultas en los Estados Unidos (o más de 21 millones de personas en edad de votar) carecen de dicha identificación, según un informe del 2006 del Brennan Center for Justice. La encuesta encontró que los adultos mayores, las personas racializadas y las personas de bajos recursos son las más propensas a no tenerla. \\u201CTenemos una enorme crisis de identificación en este país, que lo afecta todo\\u201D, añadió Calvin. Si tú o alguna persona que conoces ha tenido problemas para recibir la vacuna, escribe a stephanie.lee@buzzfeed.com o a stephanie.baer@buzzfeed.com, o contáctanos vía uno de nuestros canales seguros. Conforme hay cada vez más gente elegible para la vacunación, las autoridades sanitarias están lidiando con la forma de evitar que haya quien se salte la fila y, al mismo tiempo, de proporcionar vacunas a quienes tienen mayor riesgo de sufrir síntomas graves, un dilema complicado para el fragmentado sistema de salud del país. Aquellos con el tiempo y los recursos para insistir en que se les provea la vacunación logran proteegerse contra el mortal virus. El resto está en peligro de que se le deje a su suerte.Cuando Florida abrió por primera vez su sistema de vacunación a adultos de 65 años o más, no se consideraba la residencia en el estado como requisito para recibir la dosis. De todas partes del mundo \\u2014Argentina, México, Nueva York, Canadá\\u2014 llegaron aviones llenos de gente al llamado Sunshine State. \\u201CYa vacunado!!\\u201D, tuiteó un conductor de televisión mexicano desde Miami. \\u201CGracias #usa que tristeza que mi país no me brindó esa seguridad!!!\\u201D Los habitantes de Florida explotaron. Para ellos, ver a foráneos saltarse la fila era otro insulto más contra los adultos mayores que ya navegaban una logística disfuncional, luchaban por los escasos turnos disponibles en Eventbrite o incluso dormían en sus autos mientras esperaban su turno. El 21 de enero, el estado dio a conocer una lista de documentos que debían presentarse para demostrar la residencia. Mientras que el gobernador Ron DeSantis dijo entonces que la gente que vivía en el estado durante el invierno era elegible, añadió: \\u201Csi vienen de otro país o algo así... Con eso no estamos de acuerdo, y no lo permitiremos\\u201D. Fue uno de los primeros y más evidentes episodios de la lucha por equilibrar dos fuerzas aparentemente opuestas: el deseo de distribuir la vacuna de la forma más amplia posible, y la necesidad de priorizar valiosas dosis para aquellos que más las necesitan. Conforme se puso en marcha el sistema de vacunación, hubo habitantes de Nuevo México que viajaron a Texas por dosis, y gente de Georgia que se trasladó a Alabama. Estos y otros estados \\u2014entre ellos Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota, y Nevada\\u2014 aseguran que no rechazarán a los visitantes. Mientras tanto, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Nueva Hampshire, Nueva York, Carolina del Norte, Oklahoma, y Washington, junto con Florida, tomaron el camino contrario, reservando las dosis para quienes viven o trabajan en su territorio. Los Centros para la Prevención y el Control de Enfermedades permitieron a los estados decidir restringir las vacunas a residentes \\u201Csiempre y cuando las medidas estén pensadas para perseguir objetivos de salud pública, tales como llegar a poblaciones prioritarias y promover la equidad\\u201D. En un centro de vacunación en Washington Heights, un barrio mayoritariamente latino en la ciudad de Nueva York, se permitió a los habitantes de los suburbios solicitar citas de vacunación, de acuerdo con City, un periódico local. La publicación de la historia llevó a que el centro de vacunación reservara todos los turnos de ahí en adelante para residentes, el 60% de los cuales fueron para residentes de Washington Heights, Inwood, North Harlem, Central Harlem y South Bronx. Asimismo, en Filadelfia, el Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium anunció recientemente que, para obtener la vacuna, las personas menores de 75 años tendrían que demostrar residencia en un código postal con altos niveles de hospitalizaciones y muertes a nivel de la ciudad. \\u201CEl número de individuos sin condiciones de riesgo que se han desplazado a los barrios de la comunidad negra [para obtener vacunas] en el último mes es inadmisible\\u201D, dijo el fundador del grupo a la prensa en febrero. El costo de mantener alejados a los turistas de vacunas, no obstante, podría significar excluir a aquellas personas que carecen de identificaciones o pruebas de residencia, así como a quienes viven en la calle o salieron recientemente de la cárcel. En Florida, defensores de migrantes cuestionaron si el requisito de residencia era una respuesta proporcional al problema. ¿Debe un estado de 21 millones de habitantes, incluyendo un aproximado de 775,000 inmigrantes indocumentados, adoptar una política que deja fuera a los foráneos? Más de 80,000 no residentes se han vacunado en el estado hasta ahora, aunque esta cifra incluye a quienes habitan en Florida de forma temporal y tienen domicilio permanente en otra parte. \\u201CVisto en un sentido amplio, no creo que aquellas personas que viajan para vacunarse supongan un riesgo estadísticamente preocupante\\u201D, declaró Thomas Kennedy, coordinador de United We Dream en Florida, un grupo defensor de inmigrantes liderado por jóvenes. \\u201CNo es suficiente argumento para adoptar estas restricciones que excluyen de la vacunación a grandes porciones de nuestras poblaciones más expuestas y vulnerables\\u201D. En Florida no se requiere demostrar que se es ciudadano estadounidense o residente permanente, sino solamente que se vive en el estado. Los documentos aceptados incluyen recibos de gas, hipotecas o contratos de arrendamiento, y estados de cuenta bancarios. Miguel, el jornalero de las afueras de Miami, no tiene ninguno de estos papeles. Se muda con frecuencia, aseguró, y actualmente vive en una casa de tres recámaras con otras cuatro personas. No tiene ningún recibo o contrato de arrendamiento con su nombre. Luego de acabar en el hospital en otoño de 2020 debido a una fuerte infección por COVID-19, Miguel quiere evitar que el episodio se repita. De por sí, muchas personas en la comunidad latina se muestran recelosas ante la vacuna, dice Oscar Londoño de WeCount, un grupo defensor de trabajadores migrantes y de personas de bajos recursos al sur de Florida; añadir a la ecuación la necesidad de demostrar la residencia dificulta convencer a personas que desconfían, quizás, del gobierno y de la autoridad médica. Adonia Simpson, abogada defensora de lo familiar en Americans for Immigrant Justice, un bufete jurídico sin fines de lucro con base en Miami, se muestra preocupada porque la política de elegibilidad se publicite a partir de la \\u201Cprueba de residencia estadounidense\\u201D \\u2014una frase que leyó hace poco en la publicación de un hospital en redes sociales\\u2014, lo que podría llevar a mucha gente a pensar erróneamente que el requisito está ligado al estatus migratorio. \\u201CNos preocupa mucho que personas que podrían ser elegibles piensen lo contrario por la forma en que se transmite el mensaje\\u201D, dijo. El Departamento de Seguridad Interior afirmó que todas las personas deben tener acceso a las vacunas \\u201Csin importar su estatus migratorio\\u201D. Muchos estados declaran explícitamente en sus sitios web que el estatus no es obstáculo para obtener la vacuna. Sin embargo, quienes gestionan las dosis no siempre siguen estas políticas. A pesar de que en Texas no hay requisito de residencia, Abraham Diaz contó en una estación de radio local que a su padre lo habían rechazado en una clínica de la Universidad de Texas Rio Grande Valley por presentarse a la cita sin documentos. \\u201C[Mi papá] dijo que [el trabajador de la salud] le dijo en frente de todos: \\u2018usted no tiene número de seguro social, así que no le podemos ayudar. Es solo para ciudadanos estadounidenses\\u2019\\u201D, relató Diaz. Posteriormente, la universidad se disculpó.En High Point, Carolina del Norte, Laura Zambrano Durán, de 85 años, no pudo obtener la vacuna en su farmacia Walgreens local porque un empleado le dijo que necesitaba una identificación del estado, a pesar de que Carolina del Norte aún no había endurecido sus lineamientos de residencia. En octubre de 2019, viajó de Colombia a los Estados Unidos para una visita familiar de seis meses, que tuvo que extender de forma indefinida cuando golpeó la pandemia. Al hacer cita en un hospital, descubrió que su pasaporte colombiano era suficiente para comprobar que cumplía el requisito de edad. Phil Caruso, vocero de Walgreens, dijo que las sucursales de la compañía exigen una identificación para confirmar que la persona es elegible para la vacunación y que, a menos de que la autoridad local lo solicite de forma explícita, no puede negársele a personas que carezcan de ella. Sobre el caso de Duran, dijo: \\u201CEstamos revisando nuestros procesos con la sucursal, para evitar que esto se repita\\u201D.Rene Trujillo estaba emocionado de celebrar el cumpleaños 88 de su madre con el regalo perfecto: la vacuna. Por ello, el mes pasado Trujillo y su esposa, radicados en Seattle, le agendaron una cita en línea en la farmacia Vons cerca de su casa en Bakersfield, California. El sitio de registro de la farmacia no tenía muchas instrucciones, e indicaba simplemente que debía presentarse con \\u201Cuna identificación con fotografía que acredite la edad requerida\\u201D. La madre de Trujillo, ciudadana estadounidense, lleva viviendo en California más de una docena de años pero no tiene licencia de conducir, así que, para mayor certeza, se presentó con un montón de documentos: una identificación de Florida, donde había vivido antes, su pasaporte, y sus tarjetas de seguridad social y Medicare. (Nota aclaratoria: Trujillo es pariente de una de las autoras de esta historia.) Al llegar, un empleado de Vons le indicó que necesitaba una identificación del estado de California, se negó a ver sus otros documentos, y finalmente la rechazó, según cuenta Trujillo. \\u201CLleva 55 años en este país, 50 siendo ciudadana, y se pregunta, si a ella la tratan así, cómo tratarán a otras personas\\u201D, dice Trujillo de su madre, quien se negó a una entrevista. \\u201CNo quiere arriesgarse otra vez a pasar por este proceso de posible humillación\\u201D. Andrew Whelan, vocero de Albertsons, compañía de la que Vons es parte, dijo que la práctica de la empresa es aceptar documentos que acrediten la elegibilidad de la persona según los lineamientos de las autoridades sanitarias locales, y que el \\u201Cincidente, tal como se describe, no refleja la forma en que esperamos que se apliquen nuestras políticas\\u201D. Aseguró que la compañía se puso en contacto con farmacias en el área de Bakersfield para asegurarse de que conocen dichas políticas. Incluso en un estado con un sistema de vacunación \\u201Cbasado en la elegibilidad sin considerar estatus migratorio o residencia\\u201D, los californianos se han enfrentado con obstáculos inesperados en centros de vacunación locales. En el condado de Sacramento, Emily Jones, de 33 años, cuidadora de su hermano, se presentó a la cita en una sucursal de Safeway en Elk Grove con tres cartas de aprobación: de su autoridad sanitaria local, de la agencia de cuidados en la que trabaja su familia, y de su madre, quien técnicamente es también su empleadora. Aunque el sitio web de la farmacia enlistaba dichas cartas como prueba de elegibilidad, a decir de Jones, el empleado del centro de vacunación se negó a aceptar otra cosa que no fuera un formulario W-2 o un recibo de ingresos, ninguno de los cuales tenía ella, dado que su madre le paga con cheque personal. Perpleja, Jones intentó con otra sucursal de Safeway en el mismo condado. Salió con la primera dosis en menos de una hora. Whelan, el vocero de Albertsons (que también es dueña de Safeway), dijo que la compañía estaba cubriendo también el área de Sacramento para asegurarse de que las farmacias están siguiendo los lineamientos locales. En el condado de Los Ángeles, Bri, quien pidió mantener su apellido oculto para proteger su privacidad, tuvo que confrontar al personal de un centro de vacunación dependiente del condado para que le dieran la vacuna de Pfizer a su padre. Como había perdido su licencia de conducir, el padre de Bri, un mexicano-estadounidense de 65 años que vive en un hogar multigeneracional, llevó a su primera cita su tarjeta de Medicare y una factura, ambos papeles que figuran en la lista de documentos aceptados en el condado. (A partir de entonces, el condado actualizó sus reglas y ahora exige que los mayores de 65 presenten una identificación con fotografía.) No obstante, tanto una enfermera como un supervisor y hasta el director del centro se negaron inicialmente a darle la dosis porque no tenía una identificación con fotografía. \\u201CYo le insistía [al supervisor]: \\u2018enséñame dónde dice que tengo que presentar eso\\u2019\\u201D, Bri declaró para BuzzFeed News. El director del centro accedió finalmente, pero, tres semanas después, cuando su padre volvió por la segunda dosis, el personal de nuevo trató de negársela, a pesar de que contaba con la tarjeta de registro de vacunación y una identificación con fotografía de un empleo anterior, dos documentos que el condado requiere para la segunda cita. Esta vez, los empleados del centro argumentaron, según palabras de Bri, que necesitaba una identificación oficial con fecha de nacimiento. En respuesta al cuestionamiento de parte de BuzzFeed News, la instancia de salud pública del condado confirmó que las identificaciones solo necesitan tener el nombre y la fotografía de la persona. Aseguró también que para la segunda dosis es necesaria una identificación con fotografía porque algunas personas no elegibles han tratado de burlar al sistema con tarjetas de registro fraudulentas o falsificadas. Las autoridades sanitarias del condado no llevan registro de cuántas personas se rechaza, pero afirman que aquellas que eran elegibles y tenían una cita, como el padre de Bri, representan \\u201Cun número relativamente pequeño\\u201D de gente a la que se le niega la dosis, y que el personal \\u201Cpudo haberse confundido\\u201D. La instancia declaró que daría seguimiento al personal \\u201Cpara asegurarnos de que entiendan en qué momento es necesaria una fotografía y en cuál no se requiere\\u201D. Bri afirmó: \\u201Cyo comprendo que les preocupe que alguien trate de obtener algo que no le corresponde, pero en algún punto de todas formas nos van a vacunar a todos, así que para qué hacerle pasar un mal rato a la gente grande\\u201D.La escasez de vacunas para COVID-19 a lo largo de los Estados Unidos ha provocado una necesidad fundamental: hacerse de un lugar al frente de la fila. \\u201CNo sé cómo se soluciona este problema, esta idea tan estadounidense de que te subes al coche y conduces hasta donde te solucionan el problema\\u201D, dice Nancy Berlinger del Centro Hastings, un instituto independiente dedicado a la investigación en bioética. \\u201CQuizá es el eco de lo que pasó hace un año, cuando la gente corría al Target para comprar todo el papel de baño: \\u2018necesito 12 paquetes gigantes, y no me importan las 11 personas detrás de mí\\u2019. Pero en este caso va a haber dosis para todos\\u201D. La distribución de la vacuna está en manos de una miríada de fuentes, algunas de las cuales se unieron a la red apenas durante la administración de Biden: aseguradoras privadas, centros dirigidos por autoridades sanitarias locales y estatales, farmacias, centros de salud comunitarios, centros masivos operados por personal de la Agencia Federal de Manejo de Emergencias (FEMA). Ninguno de estos proveedores puede identificar y contactar fácilmente a cada persona elegible. En cambio, las autoridades sanitarias, los empleadores privados y las organizaciones defensoras de derechos tienen que encontrar cada una sus propias soluciones para que las vacunas lleguen a las personas con altos niveles de comorbilidad. En el condado de Santa Cruz, California, un hospital se asoció con un grupo de productores agrícolas para organizar una clínica de vacunación destinada a trabajadores del sector. Los agricultores entregaron listas con los nombres de sus empleados y luego les dijeron dónde y cuándo acudir. Lo único que tuvieron que hacer los jornaleros fue dar su nombre y fecha de nacimiento. \\u201CVacunamos a 1,300 trabajadores en dos días, avisándoles con cinco o seis días de anticipación\\u201D, dijo Thomas Am Rhein, codirector del grupo de trabajo COVID de la Dirección de Agricultura del condado de Santa Cruz. En el condado de Los Ángeles, donde actualmente cualquier persona de 65 años o más califica para la vacuna, los proveedores han recibido la recomendación de tomarle la palabra a personas en situación de calle de que cumplen el requisito de la edad si es que no tienen una identificación, según dijo la autoridad sanitaria a BuzzFeed News. Reconocieron que \\u201Ces posible que muchos residentes en este grupo no tengan una identificación\\u201D. Los activistas señalan que es necesario darle a la gente la mayor cantidad posible de opciones para demostrar su elegibilidad. Kelly Orians, codirectora ejecutiva de una organización sin fines de lucro llamada The First 72+, que ayuda a personas previamente encarceladas en su reincorporación a la sociedad, dice que los proveedores de vacunas podrían permitir que otras personas testifiquen sobre la identidad de una persona o hacerlas firmar una declaración jurada de su elegibilidad, un sistema similar a la forma en que se dan papeletas electorales provisionales a personas cuyo estatus de registro es incierto, para asegurar que no se excluya a nadie. Por ahora, Miguel continúa trabajando de manera presencial en la industria de la construcción en Florida, a la espera de la vacuna. Junto con el grupo de defensa WeCount, está buscando que el condado de Miami-Dade incorpore una identificación municipal que permita a los residentes el acceso a servicios locales, desde el uso de la biblioteca hasta la vacunación, sin importar estatus migratorio. La idea se ha abordado antes, más recientemente en 2019, pero el requisito de residencia para la vacuna \\u201Ccreó una sensación de urgencia de traer el tema de vuelta\\u201D, según Eileen Higgins, la comisionada del condado que trabaja en la medida. Mientras tanto, lo único que puede hacer Miguel es tratar de evitar caer de nuevo en el hospital. \\u201CSi no nos vacunan, el contagio va a seguir creciendo\\u201D, declaró en español. \\u201CEs difícil. Y las autoridades saben de esto desde hace tiempo. Así que no sé por qué no nos dan algún tipo de identificación. Como trabajadores, la necesitamos\\u201D.● Ken Bensinger contribuyó reportando esta historia.

But Zillow appears to have unexpectedly made that evidence visible. Apparently by accident, Zillow, the website that connects people with new homes and rentals, appears to be showing the outlines of these ghost neighborhoods displaced by the creation of highways and interstates. Zillow told BuzzFeed News after publication that it uses data from multiple sources, and aims to give people to most up-to-date information possible. \\\"When we identify data that is outdated, we update it as soon as possible,\\\" a Zillow spokesperson said. \\\"This highlights the long history of displacement and the impact of systemically biased land use policy in America of the 20th century, a story we continue to work to tell.\\\" In a tweet on Wednesday, architect David Cole shared an image of the Jane Byrne Interchange (formerly called the Circle Interchange) in the Greektown neighborhood of Chicago taken from Zillow\\u2019s website.If a person zooms in on the highway, rendering the map in satellite imagery, white boxes will appear where no houses or buildings currently exist. The white boxes appear to mark where houses and buildings previously stood. The fluke is possibly the result of Zillow using outdated neighborhood data rendered obsolete by the creation of the highway, which opened in 1965. It's not clear which of Zillow\\u2019s map systems is producing the ghost boxes. Zillow gets its real estate data from public records, as well as from \\u201Cdeed transfers, mortgages, foreclosures, auctions, property tax delinquencies.\\u201D Its satellite imagery uses Google Maps, which pulls from its own satellites and other parties such as Maxar Technologies, CNES\\\/Airbus, Sanborn, the US Geological Survey, and the USDA Farm Service Agency. Whatever the source, the map does seem to show houses that don\\u2019t exist anymore. A 1940 map of Chicago (posted in the American Geographical Society Library Digital Map Collection) shows buildings that appear to match up with those represented on Zillow. The area used to be home to Greek immigrants.Cole noted that these boxes may not appear in every city, but he found another example of this occurring in Cincinnati. He told BuzzFeed News that someone in the Original Chicago Facebook group pointed out the white boxes, so he decided to look for them himself.\\u201CI looked up Chicago and Cincinnati specifically because I\\u2019ve lived in both cities for a number of years, and each city has a particularly ugly history of freeways being plowed through vulnerable and largely Black neighborhoods,\\u201D Cole said. Other real estate sites, like realtor.com, also show the white boxes over areas like the Jane Bryne Interchange if people zoom in on the area in satellite mode. The federal government has a long history of intentionally displacing people with low incomes, especially people of color, through the construction of highways. In 1938, the secretary of agriculture told President Roosevelt that if the federal government routed highways and interchanges through cities, they could achieve \\u201Cthe elimination of unsightly and unsanitary districts,\\u201D according to Richard Rothstein\\u2019s 2017 book, The Color of the Law. Over the next several decades, \\u201Cslum clearance\\u201D displaced thousands of families, often Black, to build federally funded freeways through their neighborhoods."},{"author":"Craig Silverman","title":"NYT David Brooks\u2019s Project Funded By Facebook And Bezos\u2019s Dad","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/craigsilverman\/david-brooks-nyt-weave-facebook-bezos","content":"New York Times columnist David Brooks is drawing a second salary for his work on an Aspen Institute project funded by Facebook and other large donors \\u2014 a fact he has not disclosed in his columns. A Times spokesperson refused to tell BuzzFeed News whether the paper was aware Brooks was taking a salary for his work on Weave, a project he founded and leads for the Aspen Institute, a prominent think tank based in Washington, DC. The spokesperson also wouldn\\u2019t say if the Times knew that Weave took money from Facebook. In Dec. 2018, Facebook earmarked a $250,000 gift to the Aspen Institute for the project. Three months later, Brooks introduced Times readers to his concept of \\u201CWeavers,\\u201D which he described as people who fight social isolation by \\u201Cbuilding community and weaving the social fabric\\u201D across the US. \\u201CWe need to create a shared Weaver identity,\\u201D Brooks wrote in the column \\u201CA Nation of Weavers.\\u201D To make that happen, Brooks explained, he had started Weave at the Aspen Institute.Brooks has published multiple columns that promote Weave, in addition to writing pieces that mention Facebook, its founder Mark Zuckerberg, and the company\\u2019s products without disclosing his financial ties to the social networking giant. The amount and timing of Facebook\\u2019s funding, which had not been previously reported, combined with Brooks\\u2019s promotion of Weave in the Times, has raised questions about the columnist\\u2019s conflicts of interest. Last Friday, BuzzFeed News reported that Brooks wrote a blog post for Facebook\\u2019s corporate website that was timed with the release of a New York University\\u2013led study about Facebook Groups that was funded by the social media giant. Brooks did not tell his editors he was writing for Facebook, according to a Times spokesperson. The Aspen Institute declined to say how much it pays Brooks, but confirmed that \\u201Cas chair of the Weave project, he is a staff member at the Aspen Institute.\\u201D Brooks\\u2019s work on Weave means that, in addition to pulling down a salary from the Times, he has a second salaried position that\\u2019s funded by donations from companies and billionaire families that hasn\\u2019t been disclosed to Times readers. The Times said it\\u2019s reviewing Brooks\\u2019s work with Weave. \\u201CWe\\u2019re in the process of reviewing David\\u2019s relationship with the Weave Project and the Aspen Institute, and what disclosures, if any, should be added to David\\u2019s columns going forward,\\u201D said Eileen Murphy, the senior vice president of corporate communications for the Times. Murphy said other Times columnists have roles outside the paper. When asked for an example, she cited Paul Krugman, who was a professor of economics at Princeton and is currently a distinguished professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.Brooks did not respond to requests for comment. Two people who work for the Times and who asked to remain anonymous said they were embarrassed by BuzzFeed News\\u2019 previous report on Brooks\\u2019s writings for Facebook\\u2019s corporate site, in which he extolled the potential of connecting people via Facebook Groups. In recent years, his colleagues at the Times have reported critically on Facebook, detailing how the platform fostered Russian election disinformation, hoaxes, and hate speech. On Feb. 2, Times tech writer Shira Ovide wrote a newsletter on \\u201CHow to Fix Facebook Groups,\\u201D arguing that the Facebook product was the \\u201Ccommon thread\\u201D between the spread of the QAnon mass delusion, bogus health treatments, and false claims of election fraud. Three weeks later, Brooks wrote for Facebook\\u2019s corporate site in praise of the social network, suggesting that any faults attributed to the platform are due to the people using it, not the technology itself. \\u201CMy takeaway from all this research is that it\\u2019s not social media that\\u2019s the problem, it\\u2019s the ideas and behavior of the people who use it,\\u201D he wrote for Facebook on Feb. 23. Brooks began work on Weave in May 2018, according to the Aspen Institute. Its transparency report for that year shows Weave received just over $1.3 million from donors, including the Resnick Family Foundation, the Robert K. Steel Family Foundation, and James Schine Crown, an Aspen Institute trustee who sits on the boards of General Dynamics Corporation and JPMorgan Chase. Weave\\u2019s single largest donation, over $300,000, came from Miguel Bezos, the father of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and an Institute trustee. Facebook\\u2019s $250,000 arrived before the end of 2018 but was not reflected in the 2018 report, the most recent one released by the Institute. The Aspen Institute said Weave has not received money from Facebook since. A Feb. 18, 2019, column appears to be Brooks\\u2019s first mention of Weave in the paper. Brooks told readers that his concern about the lack of social cohesion led to him \\u201Cstarting something nine months ago at the Aspen Institute called Weave: The Social Fabric Project.\\u201D In May 2019, Brooks plugged an upcoming Weave event in a Times column. Three days later, he dedicated his next column to recounting the event, and the Times sent a photographer to document it. \\u201CThe people at this gathering are some of the most compelling people I\\u2019ve ever met,\\u201D Brooks wrote. Describing how participants shared emotional, personal stories, he wrote that \\u201Cthis was a gathering in which it was permissible to be an angry black person.\\u201D Brooks, who is listed as Weave\\u2019s chair on its site, didn\\u2019t hesitate to drop mentions of the organization in his columns. But he was less forthcoming about the financial status of his second job and its connection to Facebook. In 2019, as Weave pursued a project with Facebook funding, Brooks peppered columns with mentions of Zuckerberg, Instagram, and Facebook, but didn\\u2019t disclose that the company was actively funding Weave \\u2014 and, by extension, his own salary. That year also saw Brooks write sponsored content for another supporter of Weave. In Sept. 2019, his byline appeared on a piece published in the Chronicle of Philanthropy to promote Upswell, a conference organized by Independent Sector, a nonprofit. Brooks extolled the benefits of \\u201CWeavers\\u201D and his project before offering a hearty endorsement of the event. \\u201CThis is why we love working with Independent Sector and being at Upswell,\\u201D Brooks wrote. \\u201CIt is an established organization that does convening in new ways. It emphasizes social collision, not panel discussion.\\u201D The article carried a disclaimer that it was \\u201Cpaid for and created by Upswell.\\u201DBrooks and Independent Sector did not answer questions about whether he was paid to write the sponsored content. Brooks spoke at the 2019 Upswell event in a session titled \\u201CWeaving Strong Communities.\\u201D He was joined by Deepti Doshi, a Facebook employee who works on strategic partnerships and who also completed a fellowship at the Aspen Institute, according to her LinkedIn profile. Brooks, Independent Sector, and Facebook declined to comment on how Brooks and Doshi came to share the stage at Upswell. A Facebook spokesperson said Doshi did not play a role in Facebook\\u2019s decision to fund Weave. Doshi did not respond to a request for comment. \\u201CStrong communities don\\u2019t just happen,\\u201D read the Upswell program describing the 2019 panel. \\u201CThey are built and strengthened by people (Weavers) with time, skill and love. David Brooks of Weave: The Social Fabric Project and the New York Times will be in conversation with Deepti Doshi of Facebook around what motivates people to become Weavers and how they learn these weaving skills.\\u201D"},{"author":"Pia Peterson","title":"How Has Putting Your Student Loan Payments On Hold Changed Your Life?","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/piapeterson\/student-loan-forbearance-survey","content":"It\\u2019s been nearly a year since millions of Americans put their student loans in forbearance last spring.

Lee","title":"Vaccine ID Requirements Block Some Eligible People","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/stephaniemlee\/coronavirus-vaccine-id-undocumented","content":"To read this article in Spanish, click here. As an undocumented construction worker living outside Miami, Miguel is constantly challenged to prove that he exists. Police hassle him for an ID he doesn\\u2019t have. Without one, he can\\u2019t open a bank account or fill a prescription. And now, it means he can\\u2019t get vaccinated against the coronavirus. After a handful of out-of-towners made headlines for flying into Florida to get vaccinated, the state announced a crackdown on \\u201Cvaccine tourism\\u201D in January. To get a shot, residents would now have to submit documents verifying that they lived there. Requiring proof of identification can help ensure that scarce doses go to the people who need them most, government officials and providers say, and help reduce racial and income disparities in a vaccination campaign that has so far disproportionately reached white and affluent people. Sometimes, though, those rules are keeping out the very people they aim to protect. Miguel, who asked that his last name be omitted out of concern over his immigration status, has lived in Florida for more than 30 years since arriving from Colombia. But without documentation, the 68-year-old told BuzzFeed News that he\\u2019s been turned away from a vaccination site twice, even though his age qualifies him for a shot. Miguel is one of a number of vaccine-eligible people who have been turned away from vaccination sites that deem them unable to prove identity or residency. In some cases, BuzzFeed News has found, eligible people are rejected even when they show up with documents that fit the site\\u2019s stated rules, highlighting a patchwork of inconsistent and sometimes arbitrary policies across vaccination centers. While officials have imposed ID requirements with the stated intent of making vaccine distribution more equitable, they have also created barriers for many in high-risk populations, including undocumented immigrants, older adults who don\\u2019t drive, and people experiencing homelessness. In response to the incidents described in this story, Walgreens, Albertsons, and the Los Angeles County health department said they were reviewing their vaccination policies to make sure people who qualify aren\\u2019t turned away. \\u201CWe require IDs for things like vaccines because there\\u2019s just an assumption: \\u2018Well, everyone must have one,\\u2019\\u201D said Kat Calvin, founder of Spread the Vote, a nonprofit focused on helping people obtain government-issued photo IDs and getting them to the polls. Up to 11% of adults in the US \\u2014 or more than 21 million people of voting age \\u2014 lack such an ID, according to a 2006 report from the Brennan Center for Justice. Older adults, people of color, and people with low incomes were less likely to have one, the survey found. \\u201CWe have a huge ID crisis in this country, and it affects everything,\\u201D Calvin added. As more people become eligible for vaccines, health officials are grappling with how to cut down on line-jumping while getting shots to those at the highest risk of severe symptoms \\u2014 a dilemma complicated by the country\\u2019s fragmented healthcare system. Those with the time and resources to insist on being served stand to be protected against a deadly virus. The rest are in danger of being left behind.When Florida initially opened its vaccine appointment system to adults 65 and older, it didn\\u2019t make residency a requirement. People from all over the world \\u2014 Argentina, Mexico, New York, Canada \\u2014 hopped on planes to the Sunshine State. \\u201CAlready vaccinated!!\\u201D a Mexican TV host tweeted in Spanish from Miami. \\u201CThanks #usa what a shame my country couldn\\u2019t grant me that security!!!\\u201D Floridians erupted. Watching out-of-towners appear to cut the line felt like yet another insult to older adults navigating a dysfunctional rollout, fighting for slots on Eventbrite and sleeping in their cars while waiting their turn. On Jan. 21, the state unveiled a list of documents that people would have to present to prove their residency. While Gov. Ron DeSantis said at the time that people who live there during the winter were eligible, he added, \\u201CTo just kind of come in from another country or whatever, we don\\u2019t support that, and we\\u2019re not going to allow that.\\u201D It was one of the first and clearest instances of the struggle to balance two seemingly opposing forces: the desire to distribute the vaccine far and wide, and the need to prioritize precious doses for those who need it most. As the vaccine rollout has ramped up, New Mexicans have been traveling to Texas for shots, and Georgians to Alabama. These states and others \\u2014 including Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota, and Nevada \\u2014 say they won\\u2019t turn away visitors. Meanwhile, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Washington, along with Florida, have taken the opposite tack, reserving shots for those who live or work there. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has told states that they can decide to restrict vaccinations to residents \\u201Cas long as the policy is intended to promote public health aims, such as reaching priority populations and promoting equity.\\u201D At a vaccination center in Washington Heights, a Latinx-majority neighborhood in New York City, suburbanites were getting appointments, according to the City, a local news outlet. The story led the center to reserve all new slots for city residents, with 60% going to residents of Washington Heights, Inwood, Northern and Central Harlem, and the South Bronx. And in Philadelphia, the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium recently announced that to get vaccinated, people under 75 would have to show they live in a zip code where hospitalizations and deaths were among the highest in the city. \\u201CThe number of individuals with no health conditions who have never set foot in Black neighborhoods [coming to get vaccines] in the past month has been unconscionable,\\u201D the group\\u2019s founder told reporters in February. The cost of keeping out vaccine tourists, though, is potentially excluding those without state-issued IDs or proof of residency, such as people who are unhoused or were recently incarcerated. In Florida, immigration advocates questioned whether a residency requirement was a proportional response. Should a state of 21 million people, including an estimated 775,000 undocumented immigrants, craft a policy to turn away outsiders? More than 80,000 out-of-staters have gotten vaccinated in the state so far, though that includes people who live in Florida part time and have permanent addresses elsewhere. \\u201CIn the great scope of things, I think it\\u2019s statistically insignificant to worry about these narrative cases of people flying in and getting vaccinated,\\u201D said Thomas Kennedy, the Florida coordinator for United We Dream, an immigrant youth-led advocacy group. \\u201CThat doesn\\u2019t merit enacting these restrictions that carve out big portions of our most vulnerable and exposed populations from vaccination.\\u201D Florida does not require proof that someone is a US citizen or permanent resident, just that they live in the state. Acceptable documents include gas bills, mortgage and rental agreements, and bank statements. Miguel, the day laborer outside Miami, doesn\\u2019t have any of those forms. He moves homes often, he said, and currently lives in a three-bedroom house with four roommates. His name isn\\u2019t on any utility bills or rental agreements. After a severe bout of COVID-19 landed Miguel in the hospital last fall, he hopes to stave off another infection. But many others in the Latinx community are wary of the vaccine, said Oscar Londoño of WeCount, an advocacy group for migrant workers and others who make low wages in South Florida. Throwing proof of residency into the equation, he said, doesn\\u2019t make it easier to persuade people who might be distrustful of the government and medical establishment. Adonia Simpson, a family defense attorney for Americans for Immigrant Justice, a Miami-based nonprofit law firm, is worried that eligibility policies advertised as based on \\u201Cproof of U.S. residency\\u201D \\u2014 a phrase that she recently spotted in a local hospital\\u2019s social media post \\u2014 might mislead some people into thinking the requirement is tied to immigration status. \\u201CWe have a lot of concerns that people who may be eligible may deem themselves not eligible because of that messaging,\\u201D Simpson said. The Department of Homeland Security has affirmed that everyone should have vaccine access \\u201Cregardless of immigration status.\\u201D Several states explicitly say on their websites that status is not a hurdle to getting vaccinated. Those policies, however, are not always followed by those who are handing out the doses. Even though Texas does not have a residency requirement, Abraham Diaz told a local radio station that his father was turned away from a clinic at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley for showing up to his appointment without paperwork. \\u201C[Dad] said that [the health worker] told him in front of everybody, \\u2018You don't have a social, so we can\\u2019t help you at all. And it\\u2019s only for US citizens,\\u2019\\u201D Diaz said. The university later apologized.In High Point, North Carolina, Laura Zambrano Duran, 85, was unable to get a vaccine at her local Walgreens pharmacy because an employee said she needed a North Carolina ID, even though the state hadn\\u2019t yet tightened its residency guidance. In October 2019, she had flown from Colombia into the US for a six-month family visit that she had to extend indefinitely when the pandemic hit. Only when she scheduled an appointment at another site, a hospital, did she learn that her Colombian passport was enough to confirm she met the age requirement. Phil Caruso, a Walgreens spokesperson, said that the company\\u2019s stores ask for ID to confirm that a person is vaccine-eligible and that, unless specifically required by a jurisdiction, they do not deny individuals who lack ID. Regarding Duran\\u2019s case, he said, \\u201CWe are reviewing our procedures with the store to avoid this from occurring again.\\u201DRene Trujillo was eager for his mother to celebrate turning 88 with the ultimate birthday present: getting vaccinated. So last month, Trujillo and his wife, who live in Seattle, booked an appointment online for his mother at a Vons pharmacy near her home in Bakersfield, California. The pharmacy\\u2019s registration website was light on instructions, simply stating that she ought to bring a \\u201Cphoto ID verifying age requirement.\\u201D Trujillo\\u2019s mother, a US citizen, has lived in California for more than a dozen years but does not have a driver\\u2019s license. So to be safe, Trujillo said, she showed up with an armful of documents: an ID from Florida, where she used to live, her passport, and her Social Security and Medicare cards. (Disclosure: Trujillo is a relative of one of the authors of this story.) Upon arrival, a Vons staffer told her that she needed a California ID, refused to look at her other documents, and turned her away, Trujillo said. \\u201CShe\\u2019s been in this country for 55 years, been a citizen for 50 years, and she feels like, if this is the kind of treatment she\\u2019s getting, what are other people receiving?\\u201D Trujillo said of his mother, who declined to be interviewed. \\u201CShe\\u2019s unwilling to go through this process of a potential humiliation again.\\u201D Andrew Whelan, a spokesperson for Albertsons, Vons\\u2019 parent company, said that its practice is to accept documents that verify a person\\u2019s eligibility as defined by the local health department and that the \\u201Cincident as described does not reflect how we expect our policies to be applied.\\u201D He said that the company was contacting its pharmacies in the Bakersfield area to ensure they were aware of these policies. Even in a state with a vaccine rollout \\u201Cbased on eligibility irrespective of residency or immigration status,\\u201D Californians have encountered unexpected hurdles at local sites. In Sacramento County, Emily Jones, a 33-year-old caregiver for her brother, showed up to her appointment at a Safeway in Elk Grove with three letters of approval \\u2014 from the local health department, the in-home care agency her family works with, and her mother, who is technically her employer. Though the pharmacy\\u2019s website listed such letters as proof of eligibility, Jones said, the employee at the vaccine station would only accept a W-2 or a pay stub, neither of which she has because her mother pays her by personal check. Bewildered, Jones tried a different Safeway in the same county. She walked out with her first dose within the hour. Whelan, the spokesperson for Albertsons (which also owns Safeway), said the company was also circling back with pharmacies in the Sacramento area to make sure they are following local guidelines. In Los Angeles County, Bri, who asked that their last name not be published to protect their privacy, had to argue with staff at a county-run vaccination center to compel them to give their father the Pfizer vaccine last month. Because he had lost his driver\\u2019s license, Bri\\u2019s father, a 65-year-old Mexican American man who lives in a multigenerational household, brought his Medicare card and a utility bill to his first appointment, both of which are on the county\\u2019s list of acceptable documents to prove age and residency. (The county has since updated its rules to require people 65 and older to also bring a photo ID.) But a nurse, supervisor, and the site director initially refused to give him the shot because he didn\\u2019t have a photo ID. \\u201CI just kept telling [the supervisor], \\u2018Show me that he is required to provide that,\\u2019\\u201D Bri told BuzzFeed News. The site director eventually agreed. But three weeks later, when their father returned for his second dose, staff tried to deny him again \\u2014 even though he had his vaccination record card and a photo ID from an old job, the two documents the county requires for the second appointment. This time, workers at the vaccine site claimed that he needed a government-issued ID with his birthdate, according to Bri. In response to questions from BuzzFeed News, the county\\u2019s public health department confirmed that ID cards only need to have the person\\u2019s name and photo. The department says it requires a photo ID for the second dose because ineligible people have tried to game the system with fraudulent or forged vaccine cards. The county health department doesn\\u2019t track how many people are turned away, but it said those who are eligible and have appointments, like Bri\\u2019s father, represent \\u201Ca relatively small number\\u201D of people who are denied and that staffers \\u201Cmay have been confused.\\u201D The agency said it would follow up with workers \\u201Cto make sure they understand when a photo ID is needed and when it is not required.\\u201D Bri said, \\u201CI understand the concern around somebody taking something that isn\\u2019t theirs, but at some point we all need to get vaccinated anyways, so why are you giving these old people a hard time?\\u201DCOVID-19 vaccine shortages across the US have ignited a fundamental urge: to get to the front of the line. \\u201CI don\\u2019t know how we solve this problem, this very American idea that you just jump in the car and drive to solve your problem,\\u201D said Nancy Berlinger of the Hastings Center, an independent bioethics research institute. \\u201CIt may be left over from almost a year ago, when people were running to Target to buy out all the toilet paper: \\u2018I need 12 jumbo packs, and I don\\u2019t care about the 11 people behind me.\\u2019 No, there\\u2019s going to be a dose for everyone.\\u201D Vaccine distribution is in the hands of a myriad sources, some of which have only come online during the Biden administration: private insurers, sites run by local and state public health departments, pharmacies, community health centers, FEMA-staffed mass vaccination sites. No single one of these providers can easily identify and contact everyone who\\u2019s eligible. Instead, health departments, private employers, and advocacy organizations must each figure out their own solutions for getting vaccines to the people with high rates of comorbidities. In Santa Cruz County, California, a hospital partnered with a group of agricultural producers to organize a vaccination clinic specifically for farmworkers. Growers handed over lists with names of their employees and then told the workers when and where to show up. All the laborers had to do was say their name and birthdate. \\u201CWe did 1,300 farm workers in two days with five days\\u2019, six days\\u2019 notice,\\u201D said Thomas Am Rhein, cochair of the Santa Cruz County Farm Bureau's COVID task force. In Los Angeles County, where everyone 65 and older currently qualifies for the vaccine, providers have been advised to accept self-declarations that a person experiencing homelessness meets the age requirement if they lack ID, the health department told BuzzFeed News. It acknowledged that \\u201Cmany residents in this group may not possess identification.\\u201D People should be given as many options as possible to prove their eligibility, advocates say. Kelly Orians, co\\u2013executive director of a nonprofit called the First 72+, which helps formerly incarcerated people transition back into society, said vaccine providers could allow witnesses to attest to a person\\u2019s identity or have them sign an affidavit to affirm their eligibility. This system would be similar to how provisional ballots are given to people whose voter registration status is uncertain to ensure no one is turned away. For now, Miguel is continuing to work on-site with construction crews in Florida while waiting for a vaccine. With the advocacy group WeCount, he\\u2019s lobbying for Miami-Dade County to adopt a municipal ID card that would allow residents to access local services, from using the library to getting the vaccine, regardless of immigration status. The idea has been floated before, most recently in 2019, but the vaccine residency requirement \\u201Ccreated a sense of urgency to bring this back,\\u201D said Eileen Higgins, a county commissioner who is working on the measure. In the meantime, all Miguel can do is try to avoid ending up in the hospital again. \\u201CIf we don't get vaccinated, the contagion will keep spreading,\\u201D he said in Spanish. \\u201CIt\\u2019s hard. And the authorities have known about this for a while. So I don\\u2019t know why they won\\u2019t give us some form of ID. As workers, we need it.\\u201D ● Ken Bensinger contributed reporting to this story."},{"author":"Karla Zabludovsky","title":"A Billionaire Partied Through COVID. His Workers Died.","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/karlazabludovsky\/ricardo-salinas-pliego-billionaire-mexico-workers-covid","content":"MEXICO CITY \\u2014 Ricardo Salinas Pliego, Mexico\\u2019s second-richest man, flaunts his exuberant wealth on social media: Helicopter rides across the capital city\\u2019s sky. Days zigzagging around a golf course overlooking the Gulf of California. A Christmas party with a live band and a table seating more than 50 maskless TV celebrities flouting social distancing rules. \\u201CHow\\u2019s your #weekend going?\\u201D he wondered on Twitter last month, attaching a video of his 163-foot luxury yacht bobbing around the Sea of Cortez. The 65-year-old founder of Grupo Salinas, a media, banking, telecommunications, and retail empire, has used his outsize influence to promote the notion that COVID requires few if any precautions. The school he owns stayed open. His television network \\u2014 TV Azteca, the country\\u2019s second largest \\u2014 called on Mexicans to ignore the government\\u2019s top health official responsible for managing the pandemic. In the meantime, Salinas Pliego\\u2019s net worth has increased to $13.5 billion, up 15% since last spring. But his growing profits have come at a steep cost to those who keep his empire running. While Salinas Pliego publicly downplayed the dangers of the virus, his workers continued clocking in under allegedly dangerous conditions that left them vulnerable as infections surged across the country. At one Mexico City call center tasked with collecting debt for Grupo Salinas, company management kept the office open in violation of lockdown regulations, told workers to come in even when they showed symptoms of infection, reneged on a promise to compensate the family of one employee who died from COVID-19, and refused to implement a government mandate to conduct coronavirus testing at worksites with 100 or more employees, even after two workers died, according to BuzzFeed News interviews with a current staffer, three former employees, and the relatives of two deceased ones. So far, at least three people who work for Salinas Pliego\\u2019s businesses are known to have died of COVID-19 since last spring, according to interviews with workers and reporting by Mexican news media. But the full number could be even higher: Because Salinas Pliego outsources labor to third-party companies, many of the approximately 90,000 people who work for him have no public contractual ties to Grupo Salinas, making it difficult to trace the scope of deadly outbreaks within his empire. At least 200 people were fired after an employee reported the workplace conditions and the deaths of their colleagues to the authorities, who shut the call center down temporarily, according to Iván Mundo, a supervisor at the call center who said he and his entire unit were terminated. With the world\\u2019s third-highest confirmed coronavirus death toll and the highest case fatality ratio, Mexico has struggled to contain the pandemic, which has disproportionately ravaged lower-income communities, widening inequities in a country where the rich live in walled-off mansions and ride in bulletproof cars. Salinas Pliego has often seemed untouchable. He has won hefty government contracts, served as an adviser to Mexico\\u2019s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador \\u2014 who invited him to a meeting with then\\u2013US president Donald Trump last year \\u2014 and has been accused of violating laws without consequence. He has been tied to a corruption scandal involving the state oil company and owes the government up to $2 billion in taxes, according to the head of Mexico\\u2019s Tax Administration Service, though Salinas Pliego has denied wrongdoing in both cases. \\u201CLife is always a risk,\\u201D he told the live audience at the annual conference La Ciudad de las Ideas, which he sponsors, in December. \\u201CThat\\u2019s why we have to live it intensely.\\u201D Salinas Pliego did not respond to an interview request from BuzzFeed News and Grupo Salinas did not answer a list of specific questions. But shortly after this investigation was published, Salinas Pliego mocked a journalist who shared the article on Twitter, and then added: \\u201CLet the dogs bark \\u2026 it\\u2019s a sign we\\u2019re moving forward,\\u201D with a GIF from the movie Dumb and Dumber in which Jeff Daniels wipes his face with a bunch of dollar bills. The next day, a representative of Grupo Salinas wrote to BuzzFeed News. While the letter did not point out any inaccuracies in the story, it said that the company had implemented unspecified safety measures. Just a few miles from Salinas Pliego\\u2019s spacious Mexico City office, where he keeps expensive artwork and half a dozen shotguns, the consequences of his indifference to the pandemic are clear. In a glass-fronted office building located on Calle Rascarrabias, more than 2,000 people work to collect debts from clients of Grupo Salinas. In March, when the coronavirus began to spread across Mexico, staff at the Rascarrabias call center grew nervous. Managers told them not to wear face masks or use disinfectant gel because there was no reason to panic, two supervisors who are no longer employed there told BuzzFeed News.One of those supervisors, Iván Mundo, had once thought highly enough about the call center that he recruited two friends to work there. Both have since died from COVID-19. \\u201CI took them there to improve their lives,\\u201D said Mundo. Instead, the company \\u201Cruined our fucking existence.\\u201D Marketing to the poor has been Salinas Pliego\\u2019s recipe for success. In 2002, he began lending money to the millions of workers who\\u2019ve had no way to build a credit score \\u2014 housekeepers, market vendors, taxi drivers \\u2014 and have long been shut out of Mexico\\u2019s financial system. Salinas Pliego set up thousands of branches of Banco Azteca inside his Elektra retail stores, where people with lower incomes buy electronics and home goods in weekly installments with interest rates as high as 85%. \\u201CGrupo Elektra targets consumers at the base of the socio-economic pyramid in Latin America,\\u201D reads Grupo Salina\\u2019s description of the company online. In Mexico, a nation of 126 million people, that means plenty of clients: Around 56% of people work in the informal economy, often earning below the minimum wage, which is a little less than $7 a day. The loan business succeeded so well in Mexico that Salinas Pliego soon expanded to Central America and Peru. In 2012, he purchased Advance America, the largest payday lender in the US, for $780 million. Mundo began working in this empire in 2013, as a telephone operator at the Mexico City call center for Grupo Salinas. He quickly climbed up the ladder, becoming a supervisor and increasing his pay to $410 a month. A few years ago, he recruited two friends, Pedro Alejandro Hernández, 40, and Rodolfo Cruz, 32. The three chatted often inside the building, which sits on a short, narrow street lined with taco vendors and tiny bodegas. The building bears no mark of Salinas Pliego\\u2019s corporate presence, except for the printouts taped on the entrance with the names of two of his companies \\u2014 Banco Azteca: 5th and 6th floors, Totalplay: 7th and 8th floors. The money Cruz earned there wasn\\u2019t enough to help his parents move out of their modest home, but it did get him through university, where he was studying communications. He split his days before the pandemic between campus and the call center, and when the virus hit Mexico, he asked to work two shifts a day \\u2014 his mother, a housekeeper, was out of work, and his partner had just found out she was pregnant with their first child. Cruz, like the other staffers, had no real job security. They were employed by an outsourcing company that kept changing its registered name. Businesses in Mexico often use this scheme in order to pay lower taxes and avoid paying year-end bonuses, housing credits, and retirement benefits. Many outsourcing firms falsely register lower salaries, reducing the tax and social security contributions owed by employers. And by switching employees to new companies every few months, they strip them of their seniority and the benefits that come with it, including severance pay.Mundo received three letters from his superiors during his seven-year stint at the call center informing him that his contracting company had changed, each time designating him a new official start date. First, Difusión de Servicios Administrativos, then Sistemas Empresariales Grann-s, then Staff E & I, according to the letters, which he provided to BuzzFeed News. But no matter the corporate name on his paycheck, his job stayed the same: calling Grupo Salinas clients to collect debts. Difusión de Servicios Administrativos did not respond to an interview request. The latter two companies have no publicly listed contact information and could not be reached for comment. President López Obrador has championed a bill banning companies from using outsourcing firms, which he said cost the country 277,000 jobs in December, as many of these companies typically fire employees that month in order to avoid paying year-end bonuses. With the $1 billion lost through outsourcing arrangements, Mexico\\u2019s Social Security Institute could buy 55% more medicines, the head of the institute said earlier this year. Salinas Pliego has criticized the anti-outsourcing bill, saying that it will cause overregulation and slow down business. Across Mexico, workers were suddenly faced with a decision last spring: pay their bills or protect their health? In late March, the street outside the Rascarrabias call center doors, and the world at large, ground to a halt, with governments shutting down industries and people sheltering at home. But inside the building, it was business as usual. Employees, mostly part-time students or single mothers, had strict quotas to hit: a certain number of calls to place during each shift, a certain amount of money to collect from clients of Banco Azteca and Elektra. If they wanted to earn more than the baseline salary of $210 a month, they had to make sure to be on time and not take any sick days. At the start of each shift, Mundo watched as about 240 people entered the area he supervised, took their seats elbow distance from each other in front of greasy keyboards, and adjusted their headsets so the microphone \\u2014 still warm from another employee\\u2019s breath \\u2014 would graze their lips. As Salinas Pliego dismissed the coronavirus, managers at the call center instructed employees to fend it off by using aromatherapy oils and drinking juices, according to two former employees and a current one.For Pedro Alejandro Hernández, it started, like so many of 2020\\u2019s tragedies, with a cough. During the first days of April last year, Hernández, a data analyst at the call center, began to feel ill. Despite his persistent wheezing, his boss refused his request to work from home, according to his wife, Miryam Cabrera. Only when his symptoms progressed and he struggled to breathe was he allowed to miss work. By then, it was too late. He was hospitalized, and shortly after, intubated. Hernández died on April 16, 2020. Cause of death: acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, \\u201Cprobable SARS-COV 2,\\u201D the death certificate stated. He left behind a 16-year-old son. \\u201CThey violated all the norms that they should have been following,\\u201D said Cabrera, 35, speaking of the directors at the call center. She met with a lawyer shortly after to sue the company for negligence. Attorneys who claimed to work for Grupo Salinas promised her $2,445 for her husband\\u2019s death and asked her to drop the lawsuit, recalled Cabrera. She did, eventually, after realizing that it was likely to stretch for years and take her away from her son for countless hours. But Cabrera said she still has not received any money from the company. Three different people who claimed to be from Grupo Salinas contacted her regarding the payment, but she had not heard from two of them since December 2020. The third, she said, texted her at 4 a.m. last month, telling her his father had just died and that \\u201Che just wanted to talk.\\u201D She felt uncomfortable and cut the conversation short. On April 17, Cabrera picked up Hernández\\u2019s body from the hospital. Just a few days earlier, her late husband\\u2019s friend and coworker at the call center, Rodolfo Cruz, got what felt like a seasonal cold. One evening, he arrived home after working two shifts, complained about a headache, and began sneezing. Within days, he had diarrhea and a fever. Despite this, Cruz\\u2019s bosses told him to keep going to work, said his mother, Leticia Juárez.Juárez, who is nearly blind and lives in a tiny one-bedroom apartment near the city\\u2019s international airport, begged him not to go. Worried about getting fired, Cruz dragged himself to the office. He died of COVID-19 on April 27, 2020. Few people had found out about Hernández\\u2019s death by then, according to two former supervisors, who told BuzzFeed News that call center directors had called in managers and asked them to keep it under wraps so that the rest of the company wouldn\\u2019t panic. \\u201CIt was always about suppressing, hiding, and denying\\u201D information, said Nancy Soto, a former supervisor at the call center and close friend of Hernández\\u2019s. Angry at what he considered a cover-up, Mundo, who had befriended Cruz at university, gathered a group of students to record a video denouncing the abuses at Grupo Salinas and demanding justice for their colleague\\u2019s death. Local press got wind of the situation, and soon, the video went viral. A few days later, city authorities took action. Dressed in white biohazard suits, authorities arrived at the call center on May 4, placed \\u201CSuspension of Activities\\u201D signs across the doors, and vacated the building, which was finally closed more than a month after the country had ordered nonessential businesses to shut down. That day, Mundo\\u2019s boss told him and others in his area at the call center to stay home until further notice. Mundo believes his superiors were angry that he helped put together the video. As many as 200 employees were fired shortly after and told that they would not be able to return to any company owned by Salinas Pliego, said Mundo. Jobless amid the raging pandemic, Mundo spiraled into financial trouble and guilt, feeling that he was responsible for the death of his two friends because he helped them get their jobs.While some workers were sent home, others continued to work in secrecy. Managers at internet provider Totalplay, a different Salinas Pliego\\u2013owned company in the same office building, told their outsourced workers to come in, ordering them to enter through the underground parking lot, according to videos posted online and former employees. Other outsourced workers of Grupo Salinas kept getting sick and dying as the months went on. Writing in the newspaper El Universal, journalist Sabina Berman told the story of a 36-year-old cashier at Banco Azteca who contracted COVID-19. The woman and her mother died, leaving two young children behind. In her story, Berman wondered whether Salinas Pliego \\u201Cwanted to sacrifice his life for the sake of a theory of freedom.\\u201D She continued, \\u201CGo ahead, he can risk his life, not mine and not his workers.\\u201D Berman, who worked for TV Azteca for over 10 years, resigned shortly after the pandemic started, citing concerns for her health and that of her team. She told BuzzFeed News that after her column came out, Salinas Pliego tried to get her fired from El Universal. Grupo Salinas, in a release regarding Berman\\u2019s column, called her \\u201Ca bitter and ungrateful person,\\u201D and said that her words \\u201Cstem from avarice and a mercenary attitude.\\u201D \\u201CI\\u2019m neither ungrateful nor am I bitter,\\u201D said Berman. \\u201CThe size of their response, compared to the size of the crime in which they\\u2019re implicated, is ridiculous. It\\u2019s like comparing a drop of water to the Atlantic Ocean.\\u201D Salinas Pliego continued to downplay the virus. In November, he announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19. \\u201CWe\\u2019re all going to get it, and we\\u2019ll be okay,\\u201D he tweeted at the time, inserting a smiling emoji. He quickly recovered from the virus.By the end of last year, the coronavirus had made the call center too dangerous for some employees. Soto, Hernández\\u2019s friend, fell ill with COVID-19 in late October. While she was out sick, she received $98, a sliver of the $660 she would usually take home. She decided not to risk returning to the workplace. When she resigned in November, human resources staff told her they\\u2019d place her name on a list of people who could never be rehired by Grupo Salinas, Soto said. For Juárez, life after her son Cruz\\u2019s death was becoming even more untenable. A housecleaner, she had been out of a job since the start of the pandemic. Her cataracts were getting so bad that she could barely see. She wanted to sue Grupo Salinas for negligence over the death of her son but couldn\\u2019t afford a lawyer. \\u201CI don\\u2019t want to fight. He is so powerful and I am just a piece of trash,\\u201D she said. In December, a few days after Salinas Pliego tweeted the videos of his lavish and maskless Christmas party, Juárez\\u2019s husband died of a stroke. Now, she keeps two urns in a corner of her kitchen \\u2014 one with her son\\u2019s ashes, the other with her husband\\u2019s. Overwhelmed with grief and loneliness, she cannot understand Salinas Pliego\\u2019s overt displays of wealth at a time when so many people are suffering. \\u201CHe has turned this into a joke,\\u201D said Juárez. \\u201CHe is mocking our pain.\\u201D ●"},{"author":"Adolfo Flores","title":"Texas Colonias Are Still Struggling After The Snowstorm","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/adolfoflores\/texas-snowstorm-colonias","content":"No water. No heat. No electricity. Those were the conditions millions of Texans were thrown into when a snowstorm barreled through the state last week. But for tens of thousands of people living along the border with Mexico, losing these services didn\\u2019t just mean struggling through a few cold nights. Their lives were already so precarious that the freezing temperatures made even survival a challenge. For Nohemí, who lives in a community of informal settlements known as a colonia in South Texas, government neglect has long been a fact of life. When she arrived in the Rio Grande Valley from the Mexican city of Reynosa just on the other side of the border in 1994, her neighborhood initially lacked running water, electricity, and trash services. The homes where she and her neighbors lived were simple and often at the mercy of the elements, presenting a daily challenge even in the best of times. \\u201CThe storm made everything worse,\\u201D said Nohemí, a 54-year-old mother of seven, who asked to only be identified by her first name. She lives with her husband and three of her children in a wooden one-story house. When the lights went out early Monday, she was immediately worried about her 16-year-old daughter, who has achalasia \\u2014 a condition that closes off the esophagus from the stomach and requires a machine to get food into her body. She considered checking her family into a nearby hotel that usually charged $45 a night, only to find that demand for somewhere warm to ride out the storm had sent the rate up to $110, much more than they could dream of paying. She usually earned money buying and reselling jewelry, perfume, and other items at a flea market, but the pandemic made that impossible. Her husband, who remodels homes, hadn\\u2019t been called into a shift for two weeks.Unsure where else to turn for help, her daughter asked a friend who lives in the city of Mission, about 6 miles away. So she piled into their green Ford van with her husband and daughter and rushed over. Like the 400,000 or so others who live in colonias along the borderland of Texas, Nohemí and her family have come to rely on a network of assistance from neighbors to overcome the lack of infrastructure. \\u201CUnfortunately, folks are used to being abandoned by their government, so they have found ways to support each other,\\u201D said Deyanira Nevárez Martínez, a researcher at the University of California, Irvine, who studies the colonias. \\u201CIf anybody is pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps it's this community.\\u201D But this was a support system forged in a vacuum of government services unheard of in most parts of the US. While Texans in more stable circumstances hunkered down under blankets or left to join relatives in other states, waiting for a return to normalcy, Nohemí and other colonia residents struggled to keep from sliding deeper into a hole. When she dropped off her daughter at her friend\\u2019s house, which sits on a track of land next to other mobile homes, she promised to return every four hours to administer the medication and feed her. But as Nohemí drove back to her freezing home, the van broke down. The cold had busted its water pump. She called every mechanic she could find, but nobody could come to fix it anytime soon. Any hope she and her husband could get the vehicle running themselves dissolved once she discovered that all the auto parts stores in the area were closed. They had no way of shuttling back and forth between their home and their daughter. \\u201CThat\\u2019s when I broke down,\\u201D said Nohemí. \\u201CIt just felt like it was one thing after the other.\\u201D Again, she turned to her neighbors for help. A friend drove her to her daughter. The snowstorm was beyond anything she could\\u2019ve prepared for, Nohemí said. She knew how to handle summer heat that soared beyond 100 degrees, but her wood and cinder block house had no insulation and couldn\\u2019t do much to shield her family from the frigid temperatures that tore through the region. After the pipes froze across South Texas, colonia residents scrambled to find water at the few stores that were still open. Many who live in the colonias dotting Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California were part of the wave of immigration that took place in the 1990s and 2000s. They landed in unincorporated territories just over the border that mostly began forming in the 1950s, when the Bracero Program brought a circular flow of over 2 million Mexican workers to farmlands because of a shortage of US workers during World War II. For years, most, if not all, colonias lacked sewer systems, electricity, sidewalks, and paved roads. Though most now have access to public infrastructure, like the one where Nohemí lives, connecting to water and power supplies is too expensive for some residents. By the 1990s, conditions in these communities remained so difficult that the federal government passed regulations to stop their growth. But hundreds continued to grow in areas away from the border and on the outskirts of cities, said Noah Durst, an assistant professor of urban and regional planning at Michigan State University. There are two distinct types of colonias in Texas: those that are recognized by the government and those that aren\\u2019t. The government only recognizes those located near the border that were developed before 1990. Those that aren\\u2019t recognized have the most severe problems because they don\\u2019t qualify for government funding.Texas, home to most of the country\\u2019s colonias, has largely left the communities to fend for themselves, declining to set any policies for private construction standards, develop public utilities, or provide the government services locals have called for \\u2014 a stark contrast from the multibillion-dollar federal investment visible just a few miles away, where former president Donald Trump\\u2019s border wall was being built. The storm was \\u201Csimply another crisis in a series of devastating health and safety crises that are in large part attributable to the state\\u2019s failure to adequately plan for, regulate, and invest in safe and affordable housing and basic infrastructure,\\u201D Durst said. There are similarities between the crisis caused by the record low temperatures last week, the failure of the state\\u2019s electrical grid, and the myriad crises that colonias have faced over the past half-century. \\u201CBoth highlight the risks posed by a deregulatory approach,\\u201D Durst said. The people living in South Texas\\u2019s Rio Grande Valley, including Nohemí and her family, have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. After the pandemic was declared and children were forced to study at home, her three teenage girls\\u2019 schools provided them with laptops and a router, but the equipment often didn't work. One daughter has had to replace her laptop three times because of technical issues. Then, last summer, Hurricane Hanna hit the region, flooded the low-lying colonias, and smashed through people\\u2019s homes. Nohemí said their entire bathroom was destroyed; the wind tore off the roof and damaged their pipes, leaving only the toilet seat in place. \\u201CThere\\u2019s never enough money or supplies for the colonias,\\u201D said Yadira Gonzalez, a resident of a colonia and organizer with the advocacy group La Unión del Pueblo Entero (LUPE), which translates to \\u201Cthe Union of the Entire People.\\u201D \\u201CWe\\u2019re always forgotten.\\u201D Whatever services residents receive tend to come from volunteers like Gonzalez, who has been trying to get the county to help clear out trash, mattresses, and other items swept up from people\\u2019s properties during Hurricane Hanna\\u2019s devastation. After the storm last week, it was up to Gonzalez to get heaters, food, and water to her neighbors. Since freezing temperatures swept through South Texas, colonia residents would call her cell and ask for information on where they could get supplies like blankets, food, and heaters. She made a list of those who needed help and headed to LUPE\\u2019s office to sort through donations. \\u201CIt makes me angry. I see the needs of the community all the time and I gladly help out,\\u201D Gonzalez said, \\u201Cbut our elected officials also need to come into the community to see the needs themselves and not just sit in their offices.\\u201D BuzzFeed News reached out to Hidalgo County commissioners for comment, but they did not respond. Like many before her, Nohemí immigrated to the US in search of a better life. She was living in Reynosa with her ex-husband, who was a state police officer in Tamaulipas, and their two children. But, she said, the family was always being targeted by organized crime because of her husband\\u2019s work and received death threats. Once, she added, someone rammed her car, leaving her in a neck brace. Nohemí told her then-husband they should move to the US. He refused, not wanting to leave his job, but told her to go. Pregnant with their third child, Nohemí took her two children and crossed the border with a travel visa, starting a new life in a colonia, where she eventually remarried. Unlike her home in Reynosa, Nohemí said, they didn\\u2019t have a sewage system or streetlights for years. It wasn\\u2019t until residents and LUPE organized and the local government installed these services.The dangers that plague Mexico would eventually catch up to her. Her eldest daughter, Jazmine Morales, was deported from the US in January 2016 to Reynosa, where she then lived with two aunts for a few months. In May 2016, Nohemí said, a family friend said a group of men forced her daughter and a friend into a truck while walking on a street in Reynosa. Since then, Nohemí has never stopped looking for her daughter in both countries. She\\u2019s joined search groups created by family members of the thousands who have disappeared in Mexico. \\u201CI haven\\u2019t been the same since,\\u201D Nohemí said. \\u201CI think people are tired of me talking about it, but it helps me to talk about Jazmine. To me, she\\u2019s alive. She\\u2019s alive until I\\u2019m told otherwise, and my heart won\\u2019t rest until then.\\u201D Nohemí spent most of Wednesday building wooden walls to make a room for her father, who was moving in with her family after her sister could no longer house him. It\\u2019s not uncommon for colonia residents to build rooms as needed, though it can take time because supplies cost money, which is scarce. Today, Nohemí thought back on last week\\u2019s freezing temperatures. How, despite layers of clothes and gloves, her limbs would hurt. How a water bottle she kept at her bedside almost froze overnight. She hopes she and her neighbors will be better prepared next time. Nohemí laughed as she described how her family, with their bare hands, had cut down dry branches from a nearby mesquite tree to fuel a bonfire they had gathered around. They made tea and coffee to stay warm. \\u201CWe need to be prepared among ourselves so the next time the freeze comes we\\u2019re ready,\\u201D Nohemí said. \\u201CWe have to support ourselves and our communities because no one, including the government, is coming to save us.\\u201D"},{"author":"Rosalind Adams","title":"Yankee Stadium\u2019s Vaccine Site Hits Supply Problems","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/rosalindadams\/essential-workers-yankee-stadium-vaccine","content":"On Wednesday morning, more than two dozen Bronx residents stood in line at the gates of Yankee Stadium, hunkered against the cold wind as they awaited their turn to access one of the city\\u2019s largest vaccination sites. Two blocks away, Antonio Cortez, a 42-year-old father of three wearing a red Yankees cap and a black mask, stood behind the counter of his restaurant, boxing up fried chicken and tostones for customers as he did every workday, hoping to avoid the coronavirus long enough to join the lucky ones who have made it inside the nearby stadium. He had signed up for a vaccine as soon as he learned about the site opening nearby, but his appointment wasn\\u2019t for another two weeks. \\u201CThere\\u2019s no appointments right now,\\u201D he said. \\u201CI will go to Yankee Stadium, but much later.\\u201D Cortez was one of many essential workers in the blocks surrounding Bronx County\\u2019s largest vaccination site who had not been vaccinated. In Chinese restaurants, jerk chicken joints, grocery stores, and bodegas across the street, down the block, and around the corner from Yankee Stadium, food servers continue to clock in, interacting with a constant stream of customers without the protection of inoculation even as hundreds of people get their shots in the massive, columned sports facility looming over the neighborhood. Only Bronx residents are eligible to access the mass vaccination site, which opened up earlier this month as a partnership between the city and state, and proof of residency is required for an appointment \\u2014 part of a strategy to address the disparities in vaccination rates between whiter, wealthier residents and people of color with lower incomes in New York.City data shows that white adults have been at least partially vaccinated \\u2014 having gotten at least one of the two shots required for full inoculation for some vaccines \\u2014 at more than twice the rate of Black and Latinx adults. About 3% of adults in the zip code of Yankee Stadium have been fully vaccinated so far, data shows, while it also suffered from a higher death rate from COVID-19 than the rest of the Bronx and New York City. Just six miles south, in the affluent Upper East Side, around 16% of adults have been fully vaccinated. The Yankee Stadium site opened 15,000 vaccine appointments in its first week, and 13,000 slots were nabbed on the first day. \\u201CThis is about protecting people who need the most protection because the Bronx is one of the places that bore the brunt of this crisis of the coronavirus,\\u201D Mayor Bill de Blasio said in remarks outside of the stadium on opening day. \\u201CThe Bronx has suffered, but this is a place where the people of the Bronx will now be protected.\\u201D As residents have signed up, the neighborhood's overall vaccination rate \\u2014 counting adults who've received either one or two shots \\u2014 has drawn closer to the citywide mark. But the number of people vaccinated at the site each day has dropped since the fanfare of its opening week, and many frontline workers in the neighborhood said they were still waiting on appointments or were not even sure if they qualified at all. The Yankee Stadium site was vaccinating about 2,100 people a day in the first week, but now only about 1,000 people are being ushered through it for appointments, the governor\\u2019s office said. That\\u2019s about as many people as are being vaccinated at Jacob Javits Center in Manhattan, a mass vaccination site open to any New York resident. With more than 10 million people eligible for the vaccine across the state, supply remains a challenge. On Thursday, the New York City Department of Health said it had 17,000 first doses of the vaccine available, even though it previously had been providing shots to as many as 30,000 people a day. The federal government ships new supplies at the beginning of each week, and the city said it expects another 169,000 doses next week. As the coronavirus continues to impact communities of color at much higher rates, one of the questions that the city and the state must grapple with is where to disperse those doses when supplies are tight, appointments are quickly filling up, and millions more are becoming eligible for the vaccine. The city and state have so far declined to release data about how many doses have been administered at each vaccine site. Though rows of barricades were set up outside the vaccination entrance to organize crowds Wednesday morning, by the afternoon the line had dwindled away, leaving the area largely empty except for the National Guard soldiers standing guard. A sign perched outside the entrance said that there were no appointments currently available. Several who had been able to get an appointment at the site said the process was efficient and they were in and out of Yankee Stadium quickly with their vaccination shot. \\u201CI just saw that they were opening this up specifically for the Bronx, so I made an appointment,\\u201D said 78-year-old Yvonne Turner, her eyes tearing slightly in the cold, as wind chill temperatures were as low as 15 degrees. The process was smooth, she said, as she left the stadium with her first dose of the vaccine early Wednesday morning. \\u201CI had no problems.\\u201D Just beyond the stadium, though, lots of essential workers who continue to show up each day still haven\\u2019t been able to schedule an appointment for themselves. They wear masks while stocking vegetables in the grocery store, serving hot slices of pizza, or bagging turkey sandwiches and sodas from the bodega \\u2014 all while putting themselves at risk of still catching the coronavirus from their customers and bringing it home to their families. Some in the Bronx, like Miguel Muñoz, who works at the Key Foods a couple of blocks from Yankee Stadium, have been eligible for weeks but still haven\\u2019t been vaccinated. Grocery store workers have been eligible since Jan. 11, but the earliest slot Muñoz could schedule was for the last week of February, leaving him anxious as he takes the subway five days a week to make his 8 a.m. shifts. Thinking about his upcoming appointment later this month as he stocked a bin of sweet potatoes, Muñoz said he was excited.People who work in customer-facing roles like grocery store workers are about five times more likely to catch the virus, according to a study published in the British Medical Journal. Some companies have enacted policies like pay raises to offset the exposure risks of going to work. And while a few companies have made those pay raises permanent, others, like Costco, Amazon, and Total Wine, quickly ended the pay increases, even as workers continue to face risks nearly a year into the pandemic. In December, the mayor\\u2019s office initiated a vaccine equity plan targeting 27 neighborhoods that had been most affected by the pandemic with outreach through public housing complexes and virtual conversations to educate residents about how to get the vaccine. \\u201CA vaccine must be distributed equally to be effective,\\\" de Blasio said in a December statement. \\u201CCOVID-19 has exposed our city\\u2019s most painful disparities, and we are addressing those inequities head-on and making a vaccine available for all New Yorkers.\\u201D At the end of January, the task force expanded its efforts to 33 neighborhoods and said that it would broaden its outreach and education efforts. But data released by the city also revealed that there remain huge racial disparities across New York City in who is receiving the vaccine. The governor\\u2019s office said in a statement that it is working on closing this gap. \\u201CFor months, Governor Cuomo has been highlighting the intolerable reality that New Yorkers of color are dying at higher rates than white New Yorkers \\u2014 and he has been working to ensure vaccine distribution is equitable,\\u201D spokesperson Jack Sterne said, pointing to efforts like pop-up vaccine sites in public housing complexes and mass vaccination sites like Yankee Stadium. \\u201CWe are ready to get as many shots into arms as humanly possible, and as supply continues to increase under the Biden administration, we will make sure doses are available in every community statewide.\\u201D But in a pizza shop just across the street from Yankee Stadium, Cupertino Vivar, its 42-year-old owner, said that while he wanted the vaccine, he didn\\u2019t know how to access it. \\u201CCan I walk over? Or I need a computer?\\u201D he asked. Focused on making pizzas from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. every day, he hadn\\u2019t noticed the signs around the stadium informing locals about where to sign up for the vaccine. At a Chinese restaurant on the same block as the pizza shop, 31-year-old employee Randy Lin said that he wasn\\u2019t aware that he was eligible for the vaccine.\\u201CI haven\\u2019t heard anything saying that restaurant workers are qualified,\\u201D he said. \\u201CLast time I heard, it was just people with health conditions can get it. That\\u2019s the recent one that I heard, but I haven\\u2019t heard anything after that.\\u201D New York state has some of the broadest guidelines in the country for who is currently eligible for the vaccine. Yet compared with other states, it remains in the middle of the pack for percentage of doses administered, at 80%, according to data compiled from the CDC (the state disputes the CDC's numbers and said that it has distributed closer to 92% of its first doses, according to its vaccine tracker). Access to information isn\\u2019t the only thing keeping some Bronx residents from Yankee Stadium. Some who spoke to BuzzFeed News said that they were wary of vaccines that were developed so quickly under the oversight of a government that has stumbled at every step throughout the pandemic. \\u201COf course I\\u2019m worried about COVID,\\u201D said 34-year old Sam Saleh, who manages one of the bodegas near the stadium. With most of his family back in Egypt, where he believes they are safer from COVID than they would be in New York, he said he wants to wait a few more months. \\u201CI\\u2019m waiting to see how people react to it, and then I\\u2019ll give it a try,\\u201D Saleh said. But for those who have managed to get the vaccine, daily routines that have felt perilous for so long feel suddenly, mercifully, safer again. Joseph Michialis, whose family runs Yankee Twin Eatery Bar across the street from the stadium, recently got his first dose of the vaccine. Born in the Bronx and a die-hard fan decked out in a Yankees jacket, hat, and scarf, he said he kept his restaurant open to serve meals to the first responders when the stadium was used as a staging ground for ambulances last spring. When the stadium became a vaccination site, Michialis said, one of the people running the appointments made sure to offer him one. He jumped at the chance. \\u201CMy mother is asthmatic, number one, and I wanna horse around with my cousins, my uncles, and horse around with them the way I used to do it,\\u201D he said. He keeps his vaccine card in the cash register, proud to show it off. ●"},{"author":"Zahra Hirji","title":"Texas Was \"Minutes\" Away From An Uncontrolled Blackout","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/zahrahirji\/texas-ercot-uncontrolled-blackout","content":"Texas was so unprepared for the powerful winter storm that hit the state this week that it was \\u201Cseconds and minutes\\u201D away from an uncontrolled blackout, energy officials said on Thursday. Such a grid failure would have led many more people in the state to lose power for an indefinite period of time. An unprecedented Arctic cold front hobbled the state\\u2019s power supplies early this week, just as demand for electricity and heating was spiking. The deadly combination resulted in more than 4 million people losing power, some for multiple days in a row. Some people reportedly burned their own belongings to stay warm. Others risked carbon monoxide poisoning to run generators and burn propane and other fuels in their homes to provide heat. At least 10 people have died so far. Texas is the only state in the contiguous US to have its own power grid, which is mainly operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT. ERCOT and Gov. Greg Abbott have drawn harsh criticism for their lack of preparation for the crisis, especially after a 2011 cold spell exposed that the state\\u2019s grid was vulnerable to failing in severe winter weather conditions. But the situation could have been even more catastrophic if ERCOT hadn't imposed the blackouts that they did, energy officials said Thursday. \\u201CThe fundamental thing we have to do to protect reliability is to ensure there\\u2019s not a catastrophic blackout \\u2014 to ensure we don\\u2019t get in a situation where we are starting the grid from scratch and power could be out for an indeterminate amount of time,\\u201D Bill Magness, ERCOT's president and CEO, said on a press call. \\u201CThat is the disaster scenario that\\u2019s our central job to avoid.\\u201D When asked about how close the state was to experiencing the worst-case scenario of an uncontrolled blackout, Magness responded, \\u201CIt was seconds and minutes.\\u201D While this type of blackout for an indefinite period of time would have been catastrophic, the ongoing power outages and record low temperatures have caused unprecedented suffering in the state, as hundreds of thousands of people are still struggling to stay warm. As of Thursday morning, more than 500,000 people in the state still had no power, according to tracking by the group PowerOutage.US. Texans have been given little to no information about when the lights and heating would return. Parts of the state\\u2019s power supply weren\\u2019t accessible this week due to frozen equipment at natural gas, coal, and nuclear facilities, and frozen wind turbines to a lesser extent, officials said. By last weekend, all 254 Texas counties were under a winter storm warning. By Tuesday morning, Dallas and Houston had both clocked their coldest temperatures in roughly 30 years. \\u201CThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas has been anything but reliable over the past 48 hours,\\u201D Abbott said in a statement on Tuesday. \\u201CFar too many Texans are without power and heat for their homes as our state faces freezing temperatures and severe winter weather. This is unacceptable.\\u201D Abbott has called for an investigation into ERCOT and the power problems. Dade Phalen, the speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, requested a legislative hearing next week to discuss what led to the blackouts. \\u201CTexans look forward to hearing some answers,\\u201D Phalen tweeted."},{"author":"Pia Peterson","title":"Meet The Two Women Working To Make Inclusive Spaces For Black Joy","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/piapeterson\/polly-irungu-shavone-charles-black-joy-photography","content":"Polly Irungu and Shavone Charles are poised to make significant changes in the photography community, and what we see when we turn on our phones. \\\"I\\u2019ve spent the majority of my career advocating for underrepresented creators and communities across the intersection of tech, contemporary art, entertainment, and fashion,\\\" Charles said. Charles is a multi-hyphenate creative: model, musician, and diversity advocate, currently working at VSCO. She's also the mind behind the #BlackJoyMatters project, which has become a way for photographers and creatives around the world to spotlight their work online. Irungu is a digital editor at New York Public Radio, and the founder of Black Women Photographers, a global community and directory of Black women and nonbinary photographers. Their respective projects are labors of love and of duty at a time when both the photo industry and consumers are more aware of the issues of inclusivity and who is able to tell stories. As social media and apps like VSCO become increasingly common access points for people to get hired, they are making it easier for often underrepresented voices to be heard. As Brent Lewis, a cofounder of Diversify Photo put it, \\\"Black stories need to be told by Black folks because we've been left out of that conversation for so long.\\\" Irungu and Charles spoke through Google Chat in an interview facilitated by BuzzFeed News, which has been edited and condensed for clarity. The interview initially appeared in our photo newsletter JPG, which you can sign up for here.CHARLES.: #BlackJoyMatters is a VSCO initiative and ongoing series launched to celebrate and document Black Joy through the lens of multidisciplinary Black creatives. Last summer, in the midst of very trying times and ongoing exhausting news cycles around police brutality, this project was really a breath of fresh air for me, my colleague Ashley Robinson and the entire team that worked to bring #BlackJoyMatters to life. We loved working with Polly and the BWP to amplify the voices of Black Women and also highlight the amazing work across their network. We brought BWP on as a key collaborator throughout our series and we're excited to keep the momentum going. IRUNGU: Who couldn't use a little more joy, especially Black joy in their life? CHARLES: Right! IRUNGU: I don't think I can ever get tired of seeing stories highlighting Black womxn. I want to see more of our stories. There are so many Black stories out there to tell that I don't think we have even scratched the surface of, so I hope to see more of that this year. CHARLES: Every other day, I go to VSCO\\u2019s in-app #BlackJoyMatters carousel for a window into the Black creator community and for a literal rush of euphoria looking at Black Joy, seeing Black people photographed in our natural, joyous state. With that said, I would love to see Black people and communities of color shown and archived in a light that\\u2019s true to the full spectrum of who we are, in spite of our struggles and adversities. I want to see more stories told and uplifted. I'd like for social media to be a safer, more inclusive space for underrepresented people and creators. IRUNGU: Cannot agree more!Q: You're both Black creatives who take it upon yourselves to promote and advocate for others in the community who may have less access or reach than you do. How does that feel at the end of the day: Rewarding? Exhausting? A mix of both? IRUNGU: Whewww! It is definitely both. I think one thing people don\\u2019t realize is that when you\\u2019re constantly pouring into the community, it can take a toll especially if you do not have anyone pouring back into you. With that being said, it is one of the most rewarding experiences to see your advocacy and behind-the-scenes work making an impact and helping other Black creatives. Some days it feels like, \\\"If I don\\u2019t do this work, then who will?\\\" If I know I can make a difference now, why wait? CHARLES: Wow. That first part Polly, whew. So so true. Can't agree enough with the need for all of us to have shared accountability around making sure the environments and communities we pour into, pour right back into us as well. Some days are harder than others but this work is no doubt necessary. We have to be accountable for ourselves and our communities. We don\\u2019t have saviors or others coming to relieve us of systemic racism. With the internet and technology as our most vital current toolsets, we have to share our stories and lift others around us up as we climb. We also have to take care of ourselves in the process and prioritize self-care while we carry out this very important and necessary work. Seizing Black Joy is a radical act and practice that we have to continue to prize and prioritize. IRUNGU: Preach, Shavone! CHARLES: You already know, P! You are living this, through your work and community. Truly!IRUNGU: When I saw my work on Nasdaq\\u2019s Tower in Times Square as part of their Amplifying Black Voices campaign, I definitely had a brief moment of the \\u201CMomma, I made it\\u201D feeling. But naturally, as a creative, I am always wanting more. Don't get me wrong, I took time to celebrate that achievement, but I didn\\u2019t stop there. This month, I went back to Nasdaq to pitch a collaboration with Black Women Photographers. Throughout the month of February, they will be amplifying more Black voices, specifically, Black women and nonbinary photographers. To me, it is not enough for only me to just \\u201Cmake it.\\u201D I am constantly thinking about how I can bring other Black women into these spaces. The work I have put in for the last seven months to build this community is just another example of that commitment. Most recently, it was truly rewarding and a \\u201Cwow, *we* made it\\u201D feeling when The Kelly Clarkson Show invited me to talk about the work I am doing to help more Black women photographers get hired. CHARLES: YASSSS, Polly! I know that's right! IRUNGU: LOL, thank you, Shavone!! CHARLES: Honestly on my end, I haven\\u2019t yet fully felt this, mostly because I look around and see that so many people (including my family, peers, and colleagues) are in need in some shape or form. As a Black woman and Black creator, financial freedom and access are two of the most important factors that would impact me feeling like I\\u2019ve made real progress and created positive generational impact and equity for those who need it. I\\u2019m grateful for the earned opportunities and accomplishments I\\u2019ve had thus far, but the work continues! To Polly's point \\u2014 it is important for us to stop and just breathe and celebrate our wins and progress along the way though. I am working on being better at that! IRUNGU: It is definitely a work in progress on my end, too! Amen to that \\u2014 here's to generational wealth! CHARLES: Isn't it? Always a battle to find balance through it all!IRUNGU: Oh, man, I am trying to just get through this month, haha! But in all seriousness, I see Black Women Photographers in five years being one of the go-to destinations for anyone looking to find and hire more Black women photographers and all-around creatives. I see it being a safe space for any Black womxn looking to find community, mentorship, access to opportunities and resources like portfolio reviews, workshops, classes, and much more. I am also just ready to see it evolve on its own. Everything that has happened these last seven months has happened in the most organic way. I never want to get to a point where I am feeling like I am no longer adding any value to the community and or industry. I am just going to continue to let this grow in its own magical way. I am a firm believer of what is for me is for me. And in that same sense, I know what is for this community will be for this community. I trust that the impact is having in such a short amount of time will continue and last longer than five, 10, 15 years. CHARLES: To echo some of the thoughts I shared a bit earlier, my hope is to see more long-term generational shifts happen as a result of the hard work myself, Polly and many others are doing to bridge the gaps and create access for underrepresented voices. I am hoping we can all collectively scale our efforts and break down doors that remain open and more inviting for others to walk through. With #BlackJoyMatters, I am hoping it continues to be an infinite reminder to celebrate Black joy and the full spectrum of Black existence \\u2014 inclusive of but not exclusive to our trauma and resilience. My hope is that we continue to drive action and improve the Black condition in America through our efforts and community work. With all of my work in tech and across my creative projects, I want to inspire more action and conversations that have real impact toward REAL, long-lasting change. IRUNGU: YES YES YES."},{"author":"Emmanuel Felton","title":"Capitol Police Take A No-Confidence Vote In Their Bosses","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/emmanuelfelton\/capitol-police-officers-union-no-confidence-vote","content":"Members of Congress have been falling over themselves to praise the bravery of the Capitol Police since the attack on Jan. 6. But behind the scenes, Capitol Police have been casting ballots in a vote of no confidence in their management. Both Democrats and Republicans have lauded officers for the quick thinking that saved a number of members of Congress and then\\u2013vice president Mike Pence from the rioters, but officers are angry precisely because they were forced to improvise after their managers failed to plan for the attack. BuzzFeed News has been speaking to Black Capitol Police officers in the wake of the attack on the Capitol. They want more than just to be called heroes. They want Capitol Police leadership and Congress, which directly oversees the department, to radically change its culture, which they said, directly led to the catastrophic failure to prepare for the Capitol riot. The officers said they believe the first step to overhauling the agency would be introducing transparency and accountability. As part of the legislative branch, the agency isn\\u2019t subject to Freedom of Information requests. What little was known about the department before Jan. 6 largely came from lawsuits alleging discrimination filed by women and minority officers against the agency. Officers are casting their no-confidence ballots during a 24-hour period that started at 3 p.m. on Thursday. The ballot asks officers to vote on six chiefs, who together represent nearly all of the department\\u2019s high command. The vote is nonbinding and cannot by itself remove top brass. But for one veteran officer, the vote is key to moving the conversation from what he described as \\u201Cpolitical theater\\u201D to real accountability that would force department leadership and Congress to address officers\\u2019 concerns. On Thursday morning, shortly before the no-confidence vote started, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that officers who were on duty on the day of the attack would receive the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor bestowed by Congress. For one veteran officer, who spoke to BuzzFeed News last month and whose story was highlighted by Rep. Jamie Raskin in the Democrats\\u2019 opening statement during the impeachment hearing, news that he and his colleagues would be receiving the Congressional Gold Medal was \\u201Clike a shot of adrenaline in the arm\\u201D after an emotional roller coaster of a week. But for another, the medal felt like a distraction to officers\\u2019 efforts to use the no-confidence vote to call for substantive change within the department. \\u201CWe are paid to do a job. We don't much want or need the recognition,\\u201D said the veteran with nearly two decades on the force. \\u201CIf they wanted to show their appreciation, there are a myriad of other ways to do that.\\u201D The officers are still dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath of the attack, which saw a colleague, Brian Sicknick, killed in the line of duty. \\u201CEveryone would trade any of this in for Sicknick back, as well as everyone who is out with their various injuries. Political theater is part of the game; it just feels slimy and disingenuous,\\u201D he said. The officer also said he felt conflicted during the memorial service for officer Sicknick last week. \\u201CWe were being utilized as props. They had us in the plaza and they're taking pictures and all this stuff,\\u201D he said. \\u201CI have nothing but respect for him and only want to honor his memory, but it just didn't sit right with me or a lot of officers I spoke to.\\u201D \\u201CWe had a lot of brass that was out there front and center, but where were you at on the 6th?\\u201D he said. \\u201CWhere were you at when people needed you to make decisions?\\u201DOn the ballot this week is acting Chief Yogananda Pittman, Assistant Chief Chad Thomas, acting Assistant Chief Sean Gallagher, Deputy Chief Jeffrey Pickett, Deputy Chief Eric Waldow, and Deputy Chief Timothy Bowen. In a memo to rank-and-file officers, the union\\u2019s executive board explained why they were targeting those chiefs: \\u201Cwe cannot begin to address the systemic failures of the Department without new leadership,\\u201D the memo said. \\u201CWe have leaders in this Department. Leaders that we trust and who will work with the union to make the changes we need to make. These leaders exist, but not at the Chief, Assistant Chief and Deputy Chief level.\\u201D The veteran officer, who has been with the department for nearly two decades, plans to vote \\u201Cno confidence\\u201D for all six of the chiefs on the ballot this week. \\u201CYesterday we had a chief come to the roll call. I've never seen this man in my life,\\u201D he said. \\u201CThese people sit in a glass tower, you never see them, and now this happened, we can't keep them away. It just seems so disingenuous and blatantly screams of \\u2018I'm just trying to protect myself from whatever's coming down the pipeline.\\u2019\\u201D The officers who spoke to BuzzFeed News were split on who needed to go. One officer said he backed the new acting chief, Yogananda Pittman, but would be voting \\u201Cno confidence\\u201D for three chiefs who he said were \\u201Cnowhere to be found\\u201D on Jan. 6. But he isn\\u2019t confident that even removing those chiefs would be enough to change a culture in which he said they\\u2019re treated like glorified TSA agents by members of Congress who bristle at them doing even basic police work, often demanding that officers wave them and their visitors through security checkpoints. For the culture to change, he said, members of Congress would have to start respecting officers. Another officer, who has been with the department for about a decade, said the only thing he knew for sure was he\\u2019d be casting a vote of no confidence in one of the deputy chiefs, whom the officer also said he didn\\u2019t hear from or see on Jan. 6. \\u201CHe\\u2019s been a chief for years, and no one knows who he is; he\\u2019s never spoken to anyone,\\u201D he said of Thomas. \\u201CIf he didn\\u2019t have a uniform on, no one would even know who he was.\\u201D In a memo sent to rank-and-file officers on the eve of the vote, acting Chief Yogananda Pittman said she understood officers\\u2019 \\u201Canger and frustration.\\u201D And she added that while the vote was nonbinding, \\u201Cit does speak to the sentiment and concerns of some of our officers.\\u201D In response to BuzzFeed News\\u2019 questions, a department spokesperson pointed to the chief\\u2019s statement. BuzzFeed News separately reached out to the six chiefs on the ballot but none responded to questions about the vote. But for some of the officers, Pittman\\u2019s words rang hollow. Before being promoted to acting chief after the departure of former chief Steven Sund, who was forced to resign because of the department\\u2019s flat-footed response to the insurrection, Pittman was head of its intelligence operation. In a closed-door briefing with the House Appropriations Committee in late January, Pittman conceded that her department had failed to adequately prepare for the attack on the Capitol. \\\"By January 4th, the Department knew that the January 6th event would not be like any of the previous protests held in 2020,\\\" read Pittman's testimony. \\\"We knew that militia groups and white supremacists organizations would be attending. We also knew that some of these participants were intending to bring firearms and other weapons to the event. We knew that there was a strong potential for violence and that Congress was the target.\\\" For one veteran officer of nearly two decades, that admission alone should result in all of management\\u2019s removal. \\u201CThey had information and refused to disseminate it, and they put countless officers' lives at risk \\u2026 This is what the chief admitted to the committee.\\u201D In her note to officers this week, Pittman promised they\\u2019d receive the tools and resources they need to prevent another failure like Jan. 6. But for the veteran officer who is planning to cast votes of no confidence in all six chiefs, more training and resources isn\\u2019t the issue. \\u201CThey're just going to throw a bunch of money at some things and we'll do a bunch of training and they'll hire some outside agency to give us this new tool or whatever the hottest training of the year is and they'll charge the department an exorbitant amount of money to do it,\\u201D the officer said. For this officer, the only way to move the department forward is to get rid of its current leadership. \\u201CI do not think that's a panacea,\\u201D he said, but \\u201Cthere's no way we can move forward with the people that were in charge when [the attack] took place.\\u201D He said he and his colleagues have been struggling with moving on. He himself didn\\u2019t realize just how angry he was until last weekend, when he saw his mother for the first time and they started talking about what happened on Jan. 6. He said he could see the pain and horror on her face. \\u201CIt just hit me in a whole new way. I'm normally a very positive, jovial person, but I\\u2019ve been in a rage since that day,\\u201D he said. \\u201CIt's not a good situation to be in a workplace and to not trust the people who are making decisions that can determine if I go home or my coworkers go home.\\u201D \\u201CIt's a terrible place to work right now, and that's not what you want to have with people that carry guns for a living.\\u201D"},{"author":"Venessa Wong","title":"Student Loans Feel More Precarious In Covid Economy","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/venessawong\/student-loans-covid","content":"By late May, more than two months after losing work as an aircraft mechanic, James still had yet to receive any response from Georgia\\u2019s Labor Department about his unemployment benefits. The nearly $4,000 he had in savings, which he had expected would stretch a few months longer, were gone by then, forcing him to take out a $2,500 personal loan from his bank. With no paycheck, that too ran out with time. As a young adult trying to pay his way through college, James had few options. It wasn\\u2019t long before he began putting his rent, groceries, and gas on his credit card. First hundreds of dollars, then thousands, not even counting the interest. His old employer called him in for occasional mechanic work but too infrequently for him to depend on those wages for a living. Winter arrived. No unemployment check ever came. Some days, thinking about money and debt keeps James in bed well past the morning \\u2014 his \\u201Csafe place.\\u201D \\u201CA lot of people make it sound like you should have that rainy day account \\u2014 but that goes fast,\\u201D said James, who asked only to be identified by his first name to protect his privacy. \\u201CBeing a college student, it\\u2019s not easy to have a very big savings account, especially when you're paying for everything yourself and you don't have parental support.\\u201D James\\u2019s financial pressures are only growing heavier. A far greater debt will come due after James graduates in May: his student loans. He will set foot, a young Black man of 23 years, into the blight of a ruthless pandemic, with no savings and thousands of dollars of debt weighing heavily on his shoulders. He will have borrowed about $32,000 for his four-year degree in engineering, nearly two years of which were conducted remotely. He will owe hundreds in monthly student loan payments, on top of what he will owe for the additional debts he took on to make it to graduation. \\u201CSometimes it's paralyzing. Like, congratulations, I can pay my rent and eat today. But I'm going to have to pay all of this back in some way or another,\\u201D he said. To push through overwhelming moments like these, James recalls some unrelated advice his supervisor once gave him about running, \\u201C\\u2018If you ever get tired, just keep falling forward and your feet will just keep catching you,\\u2019\\u201D he said. \\u201CThat's where I'm at at this point.\\u201D Debt drives the American economy: Household debt was about 75% of GDP before the pandemic and close to 100% during the Great Recession. Millions of people risk huge amounts in pursuit of a middle-class standard of living. They borrowed to survive or to get ahead, they saved what little they could, and if they couldn\\u2019t pay, they were dealt harsh consequences in the form of interest fees, repossessions, and foreclosures. Households with loans have about $145,000 in debt on average, and the average monthly debt payment was $1,233 in early 2020. Yet upward mobility comes with risks, and accumulating debt for that goal puts people in a precarious financial position. What little margin for error they may have had in the best of circumstances was eliminated by the pandemic. The crisis lays bare the reality that many people are unable to withstand an unforeseen setback. Many others like James who took on college loans to secure what they believed was a path to upward mobility will enter professional life facing dire financial conditions, on the precipice of spiraling into a cycle of missed payments. Over 14 million people are behind on their rent, 27 million people are on student loan forbearance or deferral, 2.7 million homeowners pay less than their full monthly mortgage cost, and about 5% of auto loans are delinquent. Their futures are now left in the hands of the lenders and lawmakers who decide what bills to delay, forgive, or cover \\u2014 if at all. A patchwork of laws has granted people with housing and student loan debts only incremental relief that they have no chance of paying back without an economic turnaround or more government assistance. No regulatory protections exist for people with credit card debt, auto loans, and payday loans, putting their fates at the mercy of their creditors. James had hoped his college education would help him escape the financial stress he saw around him as a child, when his family sometimes had to live in motels. \\u201CGrowing up, I went through so much, and I saw so much, that after a while I just learned to compartmentalize,\\u201D James said. \\u201CI just had to learn: Sometimes shit happens, and you want to scream and freak out in the moment, but you\\u2019ve just gotta keep pushing. It definitely sucks, but it's kept me alive this far.\\u201D Resilience alone isn\\u2019t enough. By the end of January, despite his best efforts, he was a month late on rent, $600 behind on his car note, and owed $200 for overdue cellphone bills, not to mention the rising credit card debt. Emergency relief funds briefly helped him pay this down but didn\\u2019t change his fundamental circumstances. \\u201CIt all built up very quickly,\\u201D he said.Josh was the first in his family to graduate from college. He was raised in Southern California by his mother, a third-generation American whose family came from Mexico. \\u201CI was not just the first in my family to go to college, but to go to one of the top five schools in the country,\\u201D said Josh, who enrolled at Columbia University about a decade ago. It wasn\\u2019t clear how he would pay for it, but \\u201Cthere was an expectation that I would go, that you don't just throw something like that away.\\u201D So, like many, he filled out a FAFSA, or financial aid application, to see how much aid he could get. As the cost of tuition around the country skyrockets, it\\u2019s hard not to feel that higher education has become a rich person's game that everyone else keeps trying to participate in. Nearly 60% of undergrads take out a student loan \\u2014 so they have a chance to compete in the economy. And the amount borrowed for a bachelor's degree, over the years, has increased to $29,000 per borrower, according to the College Board, and it\\u2019s not just because of expensive private schools. Public colleges may have a lower sticker price but may also offer less financial aid. Graduates of public universities with loans borrow nearly $27,200 on average. Many of these students are assuming this massive financial responsibility with limited guidance: About half of undergrads are the first in their family to attend college. Just as generations of Americans in the postwar years grew up believing that owning a home was central to moving upward, many of those entering adulthood in the postindustrial US believe that a college degree is the only thing protecting them from falling downward. Before the pandemic, roughly 1 in 10 people who didn\\u2019t have a bachelor\\u2019s degree lived in poverty. Data show over and over again that people who do not hold college degrees have worse health, employment, and other outcomes. So people go to college, including millions who in reality cannot afford to and must borrow. The school requested Josh\\u2019s father\\u2019s financials, despite his parents\\u2019 divorce 15 years earlier and despite his mother\\u2019s repeated attempts to make it clear he would not be contributing to Josh\\u2019s education. In the end, she relented and contacted her ex-husband for his financial information to complete the application, even though he did not intend to help pay for school. Josh chalked it up to \\u201Cmy mother's lack of savvy with dealing with financial aid applications.\\u201D This process is a dive into the unknown for many people. Colleges don\\u2019t necessarily determine how much financial aid students are granted based on need alone. \\u201CMerit aid\\u201D often goes to applicants from families with high incomes, \\u201Ceven in the 1%,\\u201D in order to attract students who can pay more out of pocket, as Ron Lieber reported in his book The Price You Pay for College. \\u201CThis raises some obvious questions about equity, for what merit aid really does is \\u2018aid\\u2019 the family that may be able to afford the sticker price but isn\\u2019t sure that it\\u2019s willing to pay,\\u201D he wrote. It leaves those with fewer resources to borrow more. There is no minimum income requirement to get federal student loans, and students can borrow up to $57,500 for undergrad and $138,500 for grad school, without any clear sense of how much they will be earning when they graduate. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Columbia said it reviews submitted requests to waive the two-parent requirement and \\u201Cprovides admitted students the opportunity to review and discuss their financial aid eligibility before making the decision to matriculate at Columbia rather than another college.\\u201D Columbia offered Josh more aid than any of California\\u2019s state schools, but it still expected his family to contribute $10,000 out of pocket each year \\u2014 money they did not have. His mother\\u2019s poor credit disqualified them from getting private loans. So Josh resolved to somehow find a way to make it work once he got there. But the reality of making ends meet once he arrived in New York City was harsher than he had imagined as an 18-year-old. \\\"There were literally just thousands of dollars between me and having a place to live and learn the next six months,\\u201D said Josh, who asked to remain anonymous. He felt forced into making a tough choice for money. Around October of his first year in college, Josh started doing sex work, opening an account on Rentboy.com, a site where people can offer services that was later shut down by federal investigators in 2015 for advertising prostitution. The idea hatched from a comment someone had casually made to Josh as a teen after a hookup \\u2014 that he was really good-looking and \\u201Ccould make money doing this.\\u201D \\u201CIt didn\\u2019t occur to me that I would ever have to until my situation came about,\\u201D said Josh, which is the alias he used as a sex worker. \\u201CI made an account there. And pretty quickly, I got pretty popular.\\u201D On a normal week, he had three clients. On his busiest week, he had 10. Josh earned a few hundred to $2,000 per week depending on what kind of sessions were requested. But he worked only until he\\u2019d made enough to pay the school, and no more. \\u201CThere were times where I felt I feared for my life. I feared for my future \\u2014 for my name being out there associated with what I did. I feared for what that would mean for my family. I feared being found out. I feared for just my own material safety,\\u201D Josh said. \\u201CI think there's an attitude today that sex work is just another form of work. And for those who can engage with it like that, I respect them, all the power to them,\\u201D he said. But he described his own experience as traumatizing. He said he became \\u201Cemotionally numb\\u201D and was having irrational outbursts and night terrors. He was later diagnosed with PTSD. In the summer before his junior year, Josh was no longer able to handle the situation he was in. He requested a meeting with a financial aid officer and told his story before demanding more financial aid. They told him they would take it to the board, but couldn't promise anything. \\u201CI don\\u2019t think there was anything really to be said, just mutual recognition of the system\\u2019s failure,\\u201D Josh said. \\u201CInstitutions and systems don't have empathy.\\u201D Soon after, Columbia granted Josh the aid he needed to stop doing sex work. It came via a brief email with revised figures that no longer took his father\\u2019s income into account. Just like that. \\u201CThe precariousness of my existence was hinged on a few thousand dollars that Columbia didn\\u2019t really need,\\u201D he said. \\u201CI felt betrayed by an institution that had said we\\u2019re an equitable place, that we want all people of all different backgrounds to come here and succeed,\\u201D he said, looking back on his time in the Ivy League. These days, Josh, now in his mid-20s, thinks back about college and his expectations with a fresh clarity: \\u201CColleges do a lot to promise people upward mobility. They do a lot to promise brighter futures, leading the world and the next generation of leaders, and such and such,\\u201D he said. \\u201CFor me, an illusion was maintained by my teachers, my mom to a degree, and society as a whole. It said, \\u2018Hey, look, come to this magical thing called college. It\\u2019s a fantasy world that will give you the capacity to be anything you want to be.\\u2019 ... I saw that as my ladder up in the world. And when I got there, it was like, OK, turn off the illusion. Here\\u2019s reality, and you have to make this [money] up somehow.\\u201D Josh continues to pay for his education at Columbia today; he\\u2019d taken out nearly $30,000 in student loans, which has worked out to a payment of roughly $250 per month. A portion of that total is administered by Columbia itself, which ignored Josh\\u2019s request for forbearance when the pandemic began. Unlike other loans \\u2014 such as mortgages, which give you a place to live; car loans, which give you a vehicle to drive; credit cards, which can pay for essential things you need to survive \\u2014 students loans guarantee only a diploma, nothing more, leaving a borrower to gamble thousands of dollars and a future of debt in hopes of winning a career that earns them enough to pay off that debt. As of 2019, 3.3 million college graduates were living in poverty. According to a 2019 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the wealth impact of having or not having a bachelor\\u2019s degree is \\u201Cstatistically indistinguishable from zero\\u201D for nonwhite graduates and \\u201Cat a historic low\\u201D for white graduates. Two possible reasons the researchers cited for the declining financial value of college are rising consumer debt and the price of college. \\u201COur results suggest that college and postgraduate education may be failing some recent graduates as a financial investment,\\u201D they wrote. The pandemic has made the uncertain fate of indebted college grads even more pronounced. In January the unemployment rate for people ages 20 to 24 was 9.7%. James, the 23-year-old graduate in Georgia, hopes to avoid this fate. He recently received a job offer to make missiles, and he\\u2019s waiting to hear back from NASA, a dream job since his boyhood love of spaceships and planes. From afar, James was an example of the education system working: the child of a household with a lower income who borrowed money to go to school, worked hard, and got a good job. Yet a closer look shows anything but an ideal path. \\u201CYou\\u2019re making an investment on a prayer,\\u201D said James. \\u201CYou understand what you're getting into. You just don't have another choice.\\u201D For Josh, who now works for a nonprofit in California, the question of whether the debts he took on were worth the price hangs over his every decision and setback. \\u201CIn terms of who I am as a person, that's an unanswerable question,\\u201D he said of the value of going to college. The financial measure was more clear to him: \\u201CIn terms of my income, I\\u2019m probably making about what I would have made if I hadn't gone to college.\\u201DSR, a Black 26-year-old graduate of New York University, said she came from a \\u201Cvery low-income family\\u201D in California. She was the first woman in her family to earn a bachelor\\u2019s degree and is now working as a middle school music teacher, just like she dreamed. This came at no small cost. NYU offered her aid and merit scholarships, but her family was still expected to pay for room and board out of pocket, despite SR\\u2019s mother earning just $22,000 to support four children the year SR graduated from high school. Still, NYU brought her family\\u2019s expected contribution lower than California\\u2019s state schools, and so she moved across the country. At the end of her four years, she had borrowed $53,600. NYU did not respond to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News. SR\\u2019s teaching salary was about $51,000 before taxes, though, and she needed a way to pay her $500 student loan bill each month, so she\\u2019s continued to work as a server well after graduating. \\u201CI did not expect that, after graduating college, I was still going to be working multiple jobs,\\u201D she said. While student debt is almost a given for the upwardly mobile, some borrowers fall into low-wage jobs anyway, because of the very debt that they hoped would be their ticket to somewhere better. SR, who asked not to be identified by her full name, typically worked 24 to 36 hours a week at the restaurant \\u2014 classes ended at 2:40 p.m.; she would teach choir until 3:30 p.m., then hop on the subway, and have about 30 minutes to change, put on some makeup, and eat before her 4:30 p.m. shift. She\\u2019d sleep for about five to six hours before starting it all over again the next day. As hard as that was, it got worse when the pandemic hit. SR lost her job at the restaurant, and she put her student loans on forbearance. Her credit card debt rose from $0 to $11,000, due to taxes owed to the IRS and tuition for grad school courses she needs to move into a higher pay band. New York\\u2019s persistent housing affordability crisis hasn\\u2019t helped. SR rents an apartment with a roommate in Manhattan\\u2019s Financial District, midway between the school and the restaurant. Her share of the rent is $1,900. There are lower-cost areas in New York, but this was convenient to both of her jobs, which was especially important when she worked a late shift at the restaurant. SR sleeps in a space carved out of the living room with a large Ikea wardrobe. If she didn\\u2019t have student loans, about one-sixth of her take-home pay now, SR thinks, \\u201CI could probably have a real room with doors.\\u201D She wishes she had understood how her debt would affect her future. But like James, Josh, and many other first-gen college kids who reached out to BuzzFeed News, her family had no experience navigating the complexities of financing an education. Some family friends told SR, \\u201CDon\\u2019t borrow more than your salary\\u201D \\u2014 tough advice to follow when you don\\u2019t know what kind of work you\\u2019ll be doing, what the job market will be like when you graduate, and whether you can actually get a job in your field. Other family friends, including parents on the swim team her mom coached at the racquet club, told her, \\u201CDon\\u2019t let the money decide where you go. Go where you want.\\u201D Only in hindsight did SR realize that the people giving her this advice had vastly different financial resources: Their wealth gave them the confidence to believe paying back loans is not something to be concerned about. \\u201CIt was a lot of those families who had no issue sending their kids to college, with two parents that were college graduates, who had beautiful homes in gated communities with a lake or a golf course telling me, \\u2018Don't worry about the money. Go to school. You\\u2019ll be fine after.\\u2019\\u201D None of that occurred to her as a teen. And anyway, who was she to challenge the wisdom of people who were doing so well, who seemed to have figured it out? With renewed calls on Congress to pass a student loan forgiveness bill, the pandemic could be a meaningful turning point. Not only are lawmakers considering Biden\\u2019s plans to cancel student debt, but prospective students are also weighing the value of borrowing large sums of money to attend school remotely during the pandemic. And at least some young people have already decided that college isn\\u2019t the best path to financial stability. Bethany, a 30-year-old from Texas, borrowed more than $90,000 in federal and private student loans to attend a public university, her older sister graduated with $120,000 owed, and their father, who graduated when he was 38, still has $30,000 left to cover on his own college loans. Bethany\\u2019s $984 monthly bill, with interest rates that rose above 7%, became ever harder to pay when she was laid off from her job in November, amid pandemic budget cuts. Her younger brother, who is 24, viewed their struggles as cautionary tales, she said. He decided to avoid the risk of going to college and instead sought to move ahead by bartending, starting his own business ventures, and flipping houses. \\u201CHis whole thing,\\u201D Bethany said, \\\"and it breaks my heart every time he mentions it: His goal in life is to make enough money that he pays off all of my debt, my sister\\u2019s debt, and my parents\\u2019 debt.\\u201D ●"},{"author":"Megha Rajagopalan","title":"Pakistan Forced Down Apps Made By A Persecuted Religious Minority","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/meghara\/pakistan-forced-down-ahmadiyya-apps","content":"Over the last two years, the government of Pakistan has forced Google and Apple to take down apps in the country created by developers based in other nations who are part of a repressed religious minority. The move is part of a crackdown led by the country\\u2019s telecommunications regulator targeting the Ahmadiyya Muslim community. Adherents, called Ahmadis, number about 4 million in Pakistan. Though Ahmadis identify as Muslim, Pakistan\\u2019s government views them as heretics, and a 1984 ordinance forbids them from \\u201Cposing\\u201D as Muslims, adopting Islamic religious practices, and referring to their houses of worship as mosques. Pakistan is the only country to declare that Ahmadis are not Muslim. Ahmadis have faced persecution for decades, including an attack in 2010 that killed 93 people. But the pressure on multinational tech companies from Pakistan\\u2019s telecom regulator, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), signals a new willingness to target religious minorities beyond its borders. It is also one of the first examples of governments using anti-blasphemy rules to force international tech companies to censor content. At issue are seven religious apps created by the Ahmadi community in the United States, published under the name \\u201CAhmadiyya Muslim Community.\\u201D Three of the apps contain \\u201Cthe exact same [Arabic] text found universally in all versions of the Holy Quran,\\u201D as well as commentary from the Ahmadi perspective, according to their descriptions. They are still available on app stores in other countries. All of these have been taken down by Google in Pakistan. In addition, there are four other apps, which include an FAQ on Islam and a weekly Urdu-language news magazine, that the PTA is pressuring Google to remove, but which have not been taken down. Asked to comment, a PTA spokesperson directed BuzzFeed News to the department's website. \\u201COur services make search results, videos, apps, and other content broadly available, subject to local laws, taking into account human rights standards,\\u201D a Google spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CWe challenge government orders whenever appropriate, and when we\\u2019re required to remove apps and other types of content that don\\u2019t violate our policies, we try to do so in the least restrictive way possible.\\u201D Apple did not respond to requests for comment, but a notice from Apple to the app developers, dated May 17, 2019, said it was taking one of their apps down from its store in Pakistan because it \\u201Cincludes content that is illegal.\\u201D Pakistan most recently sent takedown notices for Ahmadi content to Google and Wikipedia on Dec. 25, 2020, according to a PTA press release. Two days later, Google took one of the Qur\\u2019an apps down, said Harris Zafar, a spokesperson for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in the United States. (There\\u2019s no indication that Wikipedia took down any Ahmadi content in response to the request, but the Wikimedia Foundation did not return a request for comment.) A few weeks later, a group of Ahmadi community leaders spoke with Google executives. \\u201C[Google] indicated that they had raised the human rights concerns to PTA but were told that they would have to stop their business in Pakistan if they did not remove the Ahmadi content,\\u201D Zafar said. \\u201CWe were certainly surprised \\u2026 We thought once we raised the human rights aspect, they would do what is right.\\u201D The PTA also ordered shut a US-based Ahmadi site, TrueIslam.com, threatening its administrators with criminal charges that carry a $3 million fine. The decision may not be enforceable, since the people who run the site, including Zafar, do not live in Pakistan. But it does mean they may face charges if they travel there, which means Zafar can't visit his extended family. \\u201CThis is a disturbing development and nothing short of an attempt to weaponize Pakistan\\u2019s blasphemy laws against US citizens,\\u201D wrote a lawyer who represents the site\\u2019s administrators in a letter to Pakistani authorities.Pakistan is one of several countries, including China, Vietnam, Germany, Nigeria, and Russia, that have data localization rules to exercise greater control over tech platforms. When tech companies store data or have offices in a country, they must comply with local laws. The PTA issued new rules late last year that give it broader powers to block online content. Those rules allowed it to censor content online that could, in its view, harm the government or threaten the security of Pakistan. The Asia Internet Coalition, an industry group whose members include Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, opposed the decision, writing in a letter to the regulator on Dec. 5 that the rules would \\u201Cprevent Pakistani citizens from accessing a free and open internet.\\u201D Zafar said the PTA had been pressuring Google since 2018 and Apple since 2019. Ahmadi developers have made other versions of the Qur'an app in the years since, each of which the companies have taken down following PTA orders. Google took the Ahmadiyya community\\u2019s first Qur\\u2019an app down in September 2018. After objections, Google reinstated the app and held a meeting between the company and the developers the following March. According to notes from the meeting, a Google executive asked if they would consider taking the word \\u201CMuslim\\u201D out of their name to avoid offending Pakistan\\u2019s government. \\u201CNo,\\u201D one of Zafar\\u2019s colleagues, an Ahmadi lawyer, replied. \\u201CThis decision will have a major impact, a precedent that will empower Pakistan to continue with this, due to validation from one of the world\\u2019s major corporations.\\u201D The meeting ended without a resolution, Zafar said, and in October 2019, Google took the app down again. Apple removed the same app from its store in May. Zafar said he was disappointed. \\u201CAll Google has done is capitulate to PTA and censor our community,\\u201D Zafar said. \\u201CThis exacerbates the human rights abuses against us as it validates Pakistan\\u2019s basis of the persecution. If there are alternative solutions, we would like to hear them, but to date Google has offered no alternatives.\\u201D ●"},{"author":"Pia Peterson","title":"Photos Of Immigrants Arriving At The US\u2013Mexico Border","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/piapeterson\/dire-conditions-mexico-border-immigrants-photos","content":"A record number of people, especially children, have been crossing the US\\u2013Mexico border this year, fueled by rumors of looser restrictions, even though the Biden administration has continued a policy of deporting most asylum-seekers and shelters are packed with unaccompanied minors.

Diana Albrecht, a Minneapolis-based photographer and art director, based her project Placed on this question. Over nearly two years, Albrecht connected with 10 Korean adoptees, many who had been raised in white families, to discuss how their identities were affected by their experiences. A lot of them spoke about their struggles to come to terms with their identities as people of color and their feelings of isolation from their Korean heritage. \\u201CCommunity is not homogeneity but rather a conscious effort to use our diversity of lived experiences to build something more than ourselves,\\u201D Ben, one of the participants, told Albrecht. A self-described \\u201Cmoody romantic,\\u201D Albrecht said Placed was intensely personal \\u2014 not only was she herself adopted, so were her father and brother. This made her keenly aware of the fluid space that people can inhabit between a sense of belonging and alienation, often influenced as much by a physical location as an emotional one. The project is a beautiful reminder of a community\\u2019s rich array of experiences, whether it\\u2019s as small as a family or as big as a nation.Can you talk about what it means for you to identify as a Korean adoptee? For me, to finally identify and wholly live as a Korean adoptee is getting rid of the shame I held towards my Asianness and finally forgiving myself for the multitude of ways I responded to that shame (i.e., assimilation, erasure of Asianness, internalized racism, etc.). It's a grace I give myself, knowing I might never fully access the culture I came from; I can instead forge a community and culture unique to myself and the diverse experiences of other adoptees. Lastly, and most importantly, it\\u2019s an acknowledgement that while I am a woman of color, I have been afforded so many privileges due to my proximity to whiteness. I need to continue to hold myself accountable in dismantling the systems of oppression that tell us adoptees and other marginalized folks are less than. How did you come up with this idea? Three years ago, I found myself needing an escape from reality. So I retreated to a special place on a small island overlooking the Mississippi River. The secrecy, intimacy, and beauty of the environment allowed for a lot of introspection and healing. I wondered if a physical place [had ever] impacted others in a similar way. Offhand comments from my dad (also a Korean adoptee) and brother (a biracial Asian American adoptee) made me question how people of color align to ideologies that do not support other people of color or even folks within their own diaspora. I wondered if our adoptions and, by default, our closeness to whiteness had something to do with this. These two questions happened in tandem with each other and became the hypotheses that set the tone for Placed. I chose to shoot the project on film because I wanted to be mindful of how each participant might feel meeting a stranger for the first time, opening up wounds and exposing vulnerabilities. Film allowed me to slow down, listen, and be even more thoughtful.Are there common themes you found among the people you met? We\\u2019re all still trying to figure it out! That is a huge oversimplification of the adoptee journey, but there is not one participant who is at the finish line in this marathon. As the youngest adoptee featured in the book, I looked up to all the other participants, some of whom are 20 years my senior, and assumed they were at resolution with this whole thing. In talking with some of the participants after the Atlanta shooting, which left six Asian women dead, we commiserated over the paralysis we felt in reacting to the tragic events. Some said they felt like they couldn\\u2019t connect with the AAPI community, because we as adoptees are so good at telling ourselves we are not Asian enough \\u2014 and sometimes we receive that treatment from members of the AAPI community. Others felt like we weren\\u2019t allowed to complain about the rise of hate crimes against Asians in the past year because it would take away from the experiences of Black and brown folks. Many of our white families and friends had not reached out to us, which left a lot of us feeling further confused and alone. While we\\u2019ve progressed so much in claiming our identities as Korean adoptees, that doesn\\u2019t mean we\\u2019re not still grappling with its complexities.Can you explain a bit more about the \\u201Cmodel minority\\u201D myth and how it\\u2019s affected you, your family, and this work? The model minority myth details the perceived success of Asians. It basically creates all the Asian stereotypes that deem us nonthreatening to white folks: rich, smart, obedient, et cetera. It creates a chasm between Asians and other people of color, placing us on a pedestal while telling Black and brown folks that they are only to blame for their continued experiences with racism, poverty, and oppression. The Asian community also falls victim to the myth by way of assimilation and an erasure of our cultural identity. It silences us, telling us we cannot complain about the microaggressions, violence, or discrimination we face, because of the privilege that comes with our proximity to whiteness. It\\u2019s a really specific type of racial gaslighting that I think is heightened for transracial adoptees. In many ways, I assimilated into whiteness. And while I could recognize I wasn\\u2019t actually white, I did not identify as a person of color, nor did I want any part of anything related to my birth culture. It didn\\u2019t help that I was raised in white-only environments and my parents did not have the cultural cachet to introduce me to anything [else]. A lot of the adoptees I\\u2019ve talked to all grapple with our privilege and the long process it takes to finally identify as a person of color. Though we wear that badge with pride now, that transition of unpacking years of trauma, pain, and repressed emotion is never-ending.Within that, were there any notable differences between younger and older adoptees? I was hoping to find someone 55-plus who might be considered a first-wave adoptee, but I was only able to get in contact with three adoptees in that age range \\u2014 and all three of them didn\\u2019t have much to say about their adoption or identity. Obviously, that\\u2019s not a huge sample size to draw any sort of conclusion, but I presume part of it is because our generation now has the language to talk more openly about the complexities surrounding identity. I didn\\u2019t see a notable difference between the younger adoptees and the older adoptees in the book regarding how they talk about their journey, though there was one instance in which I was talking about the many ways adoptees assimilate into whiteness, and asked the participant if they had performed whiteness. They rejected the idea of performativity because that term is too contemporary in talking about their adolescence. Overall, I think it helped that the \\u201Colder\\u201D adoptees shared similar values with the younger participants and me. They too welcomed honest and vulnerable conversation. I was so honored to have 10 incredible, brave, and beautiful humans trust me with their stories! What are things you hope a wider audience takes away from this work? So much of the adoptee narrative is one of sunshine, rainbows, and success. That is not the case for all adoptees. A lot of our families took the color-blind approach to race, which is not a productive perspective, because we still move throughout the world as nonwhite bodies, no matter how American or white we were raised. Adoptees are oftentimes left out of the conversation because there is an assumption that everything is fine because we got something \\u201Cgood\\u201D out of this. While some adoptees may align with that thinking, I do not. Because we internalize all of that, we are silenced and alone. I want adoptees, whether they are Korean or not, to know their stories matter. I want there to be a celebration in claiming their adoptee identity."},{"author":"Pia Peterson","title":"Peter Van Agtmael Talks \u201CSorry For The War\u201D Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/piapeterson\/sorry-for-the-war-peter-van-agtmael","content":"Since 9\\\/11, Peter van Agtmael has photographed in both the US and the countries that the US has been at war with. His new book, Sorry for the War, interrogates and implicates politicians and regular Americans in the violence and warfare that have torn up the Middle East for the past 20 years. He has been interested in covering war since he was young, but how he interacts with it through photography has changed immensely over the past 15 years. Both his grandfather and his father had military experience, and he grew up with those stories in the family lore. \\u201CI have no immediate plans to return to the region,\\u201D he says. \\u201CBut everything I do moving forward until the day I die is going to have something to do with 9\\\/11 and these wars and their impact and consequences in the world. They\\u2019ll always be a direct part of my life.\\u201D The book encourages Americans to see the absurdity and the serious consequences of wars that we are implicitly involved in but often opt not to see or engage with. What led you to this kind of photography \\u2014 to focus on war, conflict, and the ugliness of American expansion? Little boys in America often have a keen interest in war. Society encourages you to pay homage to the triumphs of America\\u2019s martial glory. Broad parts of politics, pop culture, and Hollywood fetishize physical courage and the eternal battle between \\u201Cgood and evil.\\u201D When I was younger, these simplistic ideas were very compelling to me. Beyond the drumbeat of society, there was a proud family history in the military, and I believe something primal in me as well. To top it all off, I was very socially marginalized for years of my adolescence, and these grand ideals seemed like a shortcut to masculinity and status. Quite dark and immature reasons to want to go to war, but surprisingly commonplace, which is why I try to be honest about my failings and foolishness. I see the power of those same seductions present in many others, often wrapped in a veneer of patriotism. When I was in college, I developed a strong interest in journalism, and photography specifically. I was also becoming politicized and starting to have a much clearer and more sober understanding of America\\u2019s complex and often destructive role in the world. And then 9\\\/11 happened, followed by the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Wars fought by my country, by my generation, and sometimes by my friends in the military. So between these massive events, my interest in war, photography, and a growing political identity, I began to form a clear idea of what to do with my life. Or at least the basic framework of an idea, which has steadily expanded outwards in the past few decades.Tell me about the book, or about the photography that led to the book. One of the earliest images in the book is the picture that became the title \\u2014 \\u201CSorry for the War.\\u201D In 2013, I passed a storefront art gallery in Manhattan that had a pop-up show called Balloons for Kabul. Inside, there were all these pink balloons floating around, a pingpong table, and pink Post-it notes where people were invited to write to the citizens of Afghanistan. The notes would be handed out to people in Kabul on their morning commute as a show of solidarity from the people of New York. It struck me as sweet, but hopelessly disconnected from reality \\u2014 both tender and absurd at the same time. At that point, I had been covering these conflicts for almost 10 years and feeling frustrated at how small and meaningless my own contribution was, despite the enormous risks I was taking. The starkness of the note reading \\u201CSorry for the War,\\u201D in all its sincerity and helplessness, struck the right tone for a work I intended as my apology for these intergenerational wars. Every book I\\u2019ve done starts with a loose idea. Photography is a mystical and magical thing, and you don\\u2019t really know where it\\u2019s going to go and what it\\u2019s going to give you \\u2014 it has a lot to do with the places where you find yourself, the people you meet there, the unexpected instances that resonate. In those early months of working on the book, I found a few things that stayed with me and helped guide this work. One was a trip to the 9\\\/11 museum. I took a picture of a mother and a daughter in front of a lightbox of the towers exploding. It\\u2019s a surreal museum, dedicated to just that one tragic day, but it misses the point that 9\\\/11 was not just about that day, it was about the history that led to that event and all that has followed. To focus on the day and not the continuum seemed like a missed opportunity. I understand how difficult it is to do justice to that history in a museum \\u2014 our narrative of this era is disjointed, still in motion, and above all deeply politicized, but it became an important thread I wanted to follow. The work was also deeply shaped by ongoing conversations with friends of mine from the Middle East and the countries we are at war with. They encouraged me to focus more on documenting the often invisible and anonymous people from their homelands. In the United States, we obsess almost exclusively over the experience of American servicemen, while the Iraqis and Afghans \\u2014 amongst others \\u2014 caught in the middle of the United States\\u2019 often incoherent and contradictory foreign policy are the true victims of these conflicts.One of the interesting things about the book is that it shows examples of the horrific effects of war, interspersed with people who are tangentially inflicting that hurt and pain but doing something very mundane, like standing next to a package. So much of this work is about the forms of subtle violence that create and sustain conflict. Unlike my prior book Disco Night Sept 11, much of the violence in this book is disconnected from danger. Artillerymen in a base in Mosul firing rounds into the old city from miles away. Weaponized drones, a critical part of modern conflict, being flown from another continent. Photographs of politicians who are enabling these endless wars through the decisions they make and the interests they are beholden towards. And then there are images of American society: what we believe, how we are influenced, and how we give politicians the license to both sanctify and commit to war in our name. In some way, everyone in this country is incriminated by the violence contained in the photographs in this book. We are a democracy. We can resist. I believe that still means something. What do you want people to take away from this work? I want people to reassess what they think they understand about this era of history. I think our collective understanding is generally very superficial. I get that. Not everyone is going to take a deep interest in the subject matter. But though most of us haven\\u2019t been personally exposed to these conflicts, they still nonetheless rage on, and their consequences reverberate everywhere in our lives. Nationalism, the ever-widening partisan schism, Islamophobia and racism, isolationism, economic costs \\u2014 5.9 trillion and counting... all have been exacerbated by the long tail of these wars, and that has enormous impact on our lives and our choice of the politicians we elect to lead us. And this is only to speak of the United States. After 20 years, we hardly know a name or a face of an Iraqi or an Afghan, while recent estimates claim up to 480,000 dead and 10 million refugees. These are unfathomable numbers. I\\u2019ve covered these conflicts for 15 years, yet I\\u2019ve seen only the tiniest pinprick of the total suffering. Yet that\\u2019s still been an utterly devastating experience. So I hope that when you see these simultaneous realities laid out before you, the familiar and the unfamiliar, you ask important questions of yourself, and perhaps find a way to act. These horrors are ultimately sustained by indifference more than any evil."},{"author":"Pia Peterson","title":"8 Photo Stories That Challenge Your View Of The World","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/piapeterson\/photo-stories-march-27","content":"In the US, we witnessed a lot of violence this week.

Biren, who goes by JEB, set out to publish a book about lesbians. It is easy to take the idea of representation for granted, but not that long ago, finding your people took a lot more work. The book, Eye to Eye: Portraits of Lesbians, was the first of its kind, and it was bold, as being gay was still stigmatized \\u2014 if not outright criminalized \\u2014 in most of the country. Biren\\u2019s book is also remarkably inclusive, even by today\\u2019s standards, highlighting women from all different races and backgrounds in an international effort to broaden the popular view of what a lesbian looks like. The book is being rereleased this month by Anthology, and offers up a rare historical testament to the beauty and diversity of gay women. BuzzFeed News spoke with JEB about the legacy of her work and the hunger to see yourself in art.

I knew I was making a book that had never existed before, and I didn\\u2019t know if I\\u2019d have a chance to make another, so I was determined to do as much as possible in this one book. What I wanted was a book where as many lesbians as possible would find a reflection of themselves and their friends and their lovers, because we just didn\\u2019t have that. As it was pre-internet, I found most of the people I wanted to photograph by word of mouth. I did a lot of traveling, and I would ask friends and friends of friends to help me locate the kinds of people I was looking for. For example, working-class lesbians, or rural lesbians, or lesbians with children. When I first spoke to them, I wouldn\\u2019t bring my camera. I was very careful to explain exactly what I was doing, because I needed people to trust me \\u2014 there was so much fear around having your image seen and used around being a lesbian. We were still classified as sick by medical professionals, sinful by most religions, and criminal under the law because of our sexuality. The consequences ranged from being banished by your own family to possibly having your job or your housing or your children taken from you. So I explained to these lesbians what I was doing and why I wanted to do it, and why they in particular would be such a valuable addition to the project. In spite of all the possible harmful consequences, [there were] people who were willing to come out, because they understood that when you can live an open life it just lifts this weight of hiding and lying and self-denial, and they made themselves an example. They had to be very brave to do that. Without their courage, there would be no book, and I\\u2019m so grateful that they trusted me and agreed to be photographed. I get emotional about it, even now. Every image is precious to me.Did you know at the beginning how you wanted it to look at the end? Very much so. We didn\\u2019t have the word \\u201Cintersectional\\u201D at the time, but I was part of a liberation movement that had intersectional politics, and we were very aware of class and race. I knew that I was not going to publicly make a book that was just my own close inner circle, because we were all too much alike. I had to go out and find people that I didn\\u2019t know, and I was not going to publish a book unless I found those people. This book was the first of its kind. Has your view on the significance of the book changed as representations of gay people have become more mainstream? These images are historic, so that remains. For lesbians, our history was intentionally hidden and destroyed for forever, we were made invisible on purpose. I feel that it is so important to have that history, to know your history, and I think everyone wants to know who their ancestors are, and to have a history to be proud of. I think that it remains important in that way as a historic touchstone. Even as lesbians have gained more visibility, that visibility still represents only a very small slice of who we are. There are far too few BIPOC, poor, immigrant, trans, and nonbinary and disabled queer people in the mass media. Not every lesbian is going to see herself reflected in Ellen and The L Word. Because I made sure to include this wide variety of people, I hope that this example being visible again might challenge others making media today to be more inclusive. I love looking at the work that younger lesbian photographers are making, and I have no interest in jumping back in there with my old eyes and my old shoulders.Did you expand the book or reconnect with anyone when you were putting together the new edition? The publisher always wanted to make the reissue as faithful to the original as possible, so we only used the original images, the same layout and design. We did add some essays, and I took a lot of time to organize all the resources and notes that are at the end of the book, but most importantly, we went back to the original negatives, and because of all the new technology we were able to make these beautiful scans that were printed in these gorgeous duotones. And because of all this, the new hardback edition of the book, to me, feels like a new book. The whole quality is so elevated. In terms of the people, I never lost touch with some of the people in the book, and the reissue put me in closer touch with others, but I didn\\u2019t try to reconnect with everyone. First of all, I was way too busy making the new edition of the book, and it wasn\\u2019t integral to having that happen, and as you can imagine in forty-something years, not everyone is where they used to be, so the project of finding someone would have been a huge undertaking. You were told that you were too well educated to be radical \\u2014 can you talk about what it means to you to be radical? First, I want to clear something up. I was told that I was too well educated to use my verbal skills in revolutionary efforts because I had learned those verbal skills in patriarchal institutions, so in a way, my mind has been colonized and polluted. So that\\u2019s when I decided to teach myself photography and use that as my tool, because I would be self-taught and avoid all the problems that went with the other skills. I would say that what it takes to be a radical, you have to have a vision of the world where there is equity and justice for all people. You have to be able to imagine that, that\\u2019s one. Two, a radical has to have the ability to feel joy and live joyously in the face of oppression. You have to be optimistic, and you have to believe that people and the world can and do change. These are the things that keep us going and give us the drive to work for the fundamental change that is needed in socioeconomic and political structures. The imagining of a better world is already joyous, and you have to live that as much as possible, and if you can\\u2019t, it\\u2019s really hard to get the work done.Do you have any advice on how to live joyously as a radical? I don\\u2019t like to give advice, actually. I like to live my life the best way I can, and let that be the advice. Let me tell you, though, about art and activism. A lot of people think those are two separate things, but to me, art and activism are united in being transformative. If you can\\u2019t visualize a different life, if you can\\u2019t visualize something better, how are you going to fight for that change to happen? These photographs allow for people to see something they had never imagined. I\\u2019ve had people tell me, \\u201CI didn\\u2019t think I could be a lesbian and a mother,\\u201D and \\u201CI didn\\u2019t think I could be a lesbian because I\\u2019m Black, and then I saw that in your book.\\u201D The hunger is very, very hard to convey, it was visceral. I felt it that way myself, and I know that other people did, because of the kind of reception that my book got. Now that lesbians are widely seen in popular culture, what audience are you trying to reach with this book? When the book was first released, because of homophobia and the limits on my own resources, the book did not reach a wide audience, so I am thrilled that now it\\u2019s going to be accessible to people all over the world. It\\u2019s really exciting. We talked about how important representation is to people who\\u2019ve been erased and ignored, and I think that it\\u2019s also important for other people to see and understand people who\\u2019ve been marginalized. I am hoping that all kinds of people will find the photographs and will feel that they are illuminating and energizing and be amazed by all these beautiful lesbians from the 1970s. We just had an administration that did a lot of things to try to push people back in the closet \\u2014 it\\u2019s not a hypothetical, it\\u2019s a real danger."},{"author":"Pia Peterson","title":"Powerful Scenes From The Colorado Shooting That Left 10 Dead","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/piapeterson\/scenes-from-the-colorado-mass-shooting-king-sooper-boulder","content":"On Monday, March 22, 10 people were killed in a mass shooting at King Soopers supermarket in Boulder, Colorado.

Kornblum recently donated the collection to the Museum of Modern Art, where the new additions \\u201Cadd significant examples of women artists\\u2019 pioneering achievements across the field,\\u201D according to a press release from MoMA. Many of the artists are completely new to the museum (which has itself only had six directors since 1929, all men, and whose collection mostly consists of work from male artists).

I first came upon her at a panel in Santa Fe, and then I sought her out to know her work.\\u201D Romero, a contemporary fine art photographer and an enrolled citizen of the Chemehuevi Indian Tribe who is based in New Mexico, portrays traditional Native American culture with a colorful, contemporary, and pointed spin. \\u201CIt is so meaningful to be part of such a major acquisition of women in the arts and to be part of Helen\\u2019s vision to bring gender parity in such a significant way,\\u201D said Romero. \\u201CI have heard it said that a collection is a portrait of the collector \\u2014 that is definitely true for me,\\u201D said Kornblum. \\u201CI feel gratified when I can be pursuing something beyond myself. I never expected the collection to have this visibility, but that\\u2019s definitely what I wanted for women to have, and so I\\u2019m thrilled.\\u201D"},{"author":"Pia Peterson","title":"9 Photo Stories That Challenge Your View Of The World","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/piapeterson\/photo-stories-march-20","content":"After a horrific shooting in Atlanta and an amplification of the calls to protect Asian Americans from violence, many asked Americans to take a hard look at themselves and the history of violence in this country.

When the coronavirus pandemic was declared, photographers, who usually can\\u2019t work from home, faced a unique choice between telling the story that was unfolding and avoiding exposing themselves, their families, and their communities to a deadly illness. Like women in other industries, many photographers who were parents took on a greater share of caregiving, leaving them burned out. Women who were used to shooting photographs out in the world found themselves in less familiar roles as stay-at-home moms. Others continued the tough balance of parenting and photography; homeschooling was added to the already difficult mix of irregular photo assignments, frequent work trips, and stiff industry competition. But as their camera lenses focused inside their homes, their routines were upended and reoriented. BuzzFeed News spoke with 16 women photographers about the advice that has helped them manage and the lessons they've learned over the last year. They each had stories of fear, anxiety, and small, unexpected joys.\\\"March 2020 to March 2021 \\u2014 the pandemic year \\u2014 is the first time in my life I have spent more than even half the year at home with my family. I was lucky to be able to continue working, photographing the pandemic in the UK and the US, among other things \\u2014 but for a great deal of the year, I was home, learning how to be a mother to two sons, a wife to my husband, and focusing on keeping busy, staying positive, and keeping fit. Being a photographer of intense assignments like conflict, humanitarian issues, and, this year, the global pandemic, is taxing both physically and mentally, so I work out pretty religiously. This image is of me and my youngest son, Alfie, who was about 15 months old in this picture, exercising in the garden. My older son, Lukas, used to copy me as well when he was Alfred's age, and these moments helped me recognize the silver lining of the pandemic: time with my family.\\\" \\u2014Lynsey Addario, London\\\"My daughter, at age 2, doesn't know other children. She is isolated completely in our bubble. Our family unit is me, my mom, and her. I took these images for us in the past year. I know some women who have made their children into a creative project, but, to be honest, this year was really about survival for us.\\\" \\u2014Andrea Bruce, Indiana\\\"Balancing work with life and kids is a regular practice in my life, so the major shift with the pandemic is balancing work with life and homeschooling kids. My son has a respiratory issue, so both children are still at home for the rest of the year. Between my coparent and me, I am the designated academic parent, so the majority of the schooling happens with me at home and means my work works around working with them. \\\"In addition to balancing work and normal life and kids, mental health has come into sharp focus during the pandemic. I suffered a pregnancy loss that had devastating aftereffects for me last year, and it took months to recover from that and a lot of very intentional effort. During a pandemic where everyone is isolated, mental health becomes more difficult to gauge; we need our communities and our people to hold us up and remind us of who we are, and things can get dark very quickly without that support. On the upside, this time has made it clear who is really in the inner circle of my social network, and there is a feeling of resiliency and power in those connections that is hard to recognize outside of crisis.\\\" \\u2014Ash Adams, Anchorage\\\"As a photojournalist, I got to go out in the middle of the worst times of the pandemic. And even if I knew I was doing important work documenting and telling the stories of the communities around me, I was always very concerned about my exposure to the virus and, consequently, my family\\u2019s. It was my worst nightmare. \\\"Because of a possible exposure during an assignment I did on the COVID-19 floor of a hospital, I was told by health officials I had to quarantine for two weeks in my bedroom. It was a scary moment, waking up every day and thinking, I might get sick today. Luckily I didn\\u2019t get sick, and now I look back at it as the first paid vacation I\\u2019d had in many years \\u2014 a true staycation, that is. \\\"As the mother of a teen, I didn\\u2019t go through what parents of younger kids went through, but I saw my son finish high school, get into college, and vote for the first time. My son\\u2019s high school graduation happened in our front yard. Two schoolteachers dropped by one afternoon and brought a surprise bag with his gown, cap and tassel, plus a shirt and a face mask. There was laughter and joy, and passersby and neighbors clapped. \\\"Among a million other things, the rites of passage have also changed this past year. As we try to adapt to a new world that is transforming in front of our eyes, it is very hard as a mother not to be able to look my son in the eyes and tell him that everything will be alright.\\\" \\u2014Adriana Zehbrauskas, Phoenix\\\"Pandemic life mashes all activities into a big blob, most of which take place in one room of our house (ironically the least used room pre-pandemic). The components are there \\u2014 school, work, involvement \\u2014 but the lines between them are very blurry and often disappear. Our kids attend school virtually, and I have been promoted to stay-at-home-all-the-time parent. There is no individual separation of anyone's time; we all exist as a unit. Work is often a brief reprieve from so much together time. Even a longer drive to an assignment alone is a welcome break. I would like to acknowledge the [our] heroes of COVID times: teachers, the neighbors who gave us their old trampoline, Lego, YA authors, Texas beaches, fellow freelancers, and the addition of two very lovely pet rats into our home.\\\" \\u2014Annie Mulligan, Houston\\\"My son would have started pre-K this year \\u2014 but at the start of the school year, NYC public elementary schools were only offering a few days per week, with no aftercare. With two working parents, that did not work for our family. Instead, we put him in an improvised homeschool pod with four other families from our neighborhood. We all help each other out and contribute however we can. As a photographer, I thought one way to give back to the group that I have really relied on would be to shoot 'school portraits' of all seven kids in the pod, like the kind they might have gotten at an actual school.\\\" \\u2014Hannah Whitaker, Brooklyn\\\"We're balancing two kids (18 months and 7 years), a dog, one person with a full-time job, and one freelancer who travels, and we\\u2019re trying to maintain an optimistic and nurturing environment. Today, for example, I called into my son's 18-month pediatric appointment from a Walmart parking lot in the middle of South Dakota, where I'm away on assignment. He waved and blew me kisses through FaceTime like it was nothing new \\u2014 because it wasn't. Our 7-year-old, who is home from school this week after the building closed because of positive COVID-19 cases, was giving his brother bunny ears in the background. \\\"With the pandemic, there is no day-to-day routine in our house. It's a constant stream of adapting to changes in our schedules. If one of the kids gets a fever, it's no school or daycare until the fever is gone and they get a negative COVID-19 test. If another kid at school tests positive for COVID-19, the school closes for 10 days. When school is in session and I get local assignments, which are usually on short notice, the pickup and drop-off schedules have to be renegotiated. Will soccer practice be held virtually in our living room or in person? It depends on the weather; we don't know until the night before. We drive by the grocery store, and if the line is too long to get inside, one of us will bring the kids home and the other will do the shopping.\\\" \\u2014Sarah Stacke, New York\\\"Motherhood is this wonderful and difficult push and pull of belonging to yourself and to everyone else. During the pandemic, I have found so much solace in my little family. My daughter has slept in our bedroom, in a bassinet next to our bed, since she was born. When it is finally quiet and we are all in bed at the end of the day, I feel so much peace and comfort hearing her breathing along with my husband. For those few moments, before I completely pass out, everything feels OK.\\\" \\u2014Bethany Mollenkof, Los Angeles\\\"This pandemic was nothing I could have ever prepared for \\u2014 especially as a mother to a young child. Not only was she missing out on key elements of her development outside our home, it was difficult to truly recognize all the good and growth happening day by day. This image is the moment I had one of the biggest awakenings, among some other small ones, during the pandemic. My daughter was growing into a beautiful, intelligent, and unique human being. All this time I mostly worried, focusing on the bad, tough moments we had challenging our relationship, and here we were talking everything over as she gracefully moved through words and play, absorbing the evening sun. We made it through. We are making it through and are grateful.\\\" \\u2014Maria Hackett, New York\\\"I often try to take on too much or don\\u2019t have the bandwidth [I need]. Early on in motherhood, several women suggested building a network of people to be able to count on and ask for help. That has been invaluable in the past year, when I thought my being around more would mean more time. Turns out that being home more just means I\\u2019m even busier than I\\u2019d imagined, and I can\\u2019t even tell you with what. The days just fill up. This network of support is a lifeline. I can\\u2019t do it all (even with a very supporting and immensely helpful spouse) and delegating what I can to others has opened up my universe. \\\"'Balance' is not a word in my vocabulary, because I can't find it. I would say that I have a lot of boxes to check daily, and sometimes I add 'self-care' to that list. My two boys have to be in school early, one in person and one virtually. Zoom school, it turns out, is terrible for a multitude of reasons. For example: I hate having to be my son\\u2019s personal assistant \\u2014 but also because it makes me feel guilty. Why don\\u2019t I enjoy sitting with my son and helping with math? Isn't that an important part of his education I should be excited about being present for? I don\\u2019t know, but I hate it. A few weeks into Zoom school, we hired a college student to help. That not only gave me peace of mind but allowed me time to dedicate to my work before the school day ends. But in a nutshell, I try to care for my two boys, my two dogs, my career, make sure the house isn\\u2019t a crazy mess, and sometimes fit in a workout or a mediation. That\\u2019s my daily checklist.\\\" \\u2014Victoria Will, New York\\\/Seattle\\\"In March 2020, my daughters \\u2014 these two siblings who are five years apart \\u2014 suddenly had no one else but each other to play with. Despite frequent meltdowns, I saw them mature in their companionship, comfort each other, and transform into sisters in a palpable way. Simultaneously, the home had now become the studio, the office, the gym, the school, and the playground, so I found myself adopting my children's toys and messes and folding them into my practice. And somehow \\u2014 within that recalibrating chaos of canceled plans, cackles, tears, and tired eyes \\u2014 slime found its way into my art.\\\" \\u2014Manjari Sharma, California\\\"There have been so many times I\\u2019ve panicked about something and then laughed about it afterwards. I think that is just parenthood. Like, a few days ago, I was cleaning up the kitchen and noticed Levi sitting on the floor with his back turned to me. Curious [about] what he was so focused on, I walked around him to find him giggling as he opened and closed a pair of extremely sharp scissors. I did my best 'hostage negotiator' and calmly snatched them out of his hands without injury or tears. I swear, toddlers are constantly trying to injure themselves.\\\" \\u2014Nancy Borowick, New York\\\"For me, there is no such thing as balance. My husband and I have two baby boys. I am a mother, wife, artist, speaker, and business owner who is learning to be at peace no matter the circumstances. My sister told me that I needed to show myself more grace. Everything may not go as planned, but it works out in the end. You must have faith. \\\"Due to the pandemic, our social interactions outside of my immediate family are limited. Most days, the boys and I take long walks with their Radio Flyer red wagon. These walks give me a chance to escape all the day-to-day work, deadlines, Zoom calls, etc. \\\"I selected a simple photograph of my boys in their red wagon. They are looking at a squirrel in the distance. It reminds me to focus on what is ahead, thereby giving me a sense of hope for the future.\\\" \\u2014Endia Beal, Winston-Salem, North Carolina\\\"I remember CNN vividly as a child, rasping on nightly while hiding in my mother's bed. My kids orbited around her bed this summer while we hurriedly turned off the ghastly news of death tolls blaring from CNN. My kids, oblivious to the news and happy to be with their grandparents every day now, were covering my mother's bed with dirt from the farm they live on, bombarding her when she was trying to work. I rarely, if ever, photograph my mother \\u2014 and being able to do so and to spend time with her and the kids together is one of the few highlights of this dreadful year.\\\" \\u2014Lili Kobielski, New York\\\"It\\u2019s an odd mix of normalcy (cherubic dancers in pink, clunky and beloved) and the bizarre, with their little masked faces in a tent where cars traditionally park, being watched by adoring, socially distanced parents.\\\" \\u2014Talia Herman, San Francisco\\\"For us, it hasn't changed life too much. Sure, we have to remember to throw masks in our pockets for going into town \\u2014 but since we live out in the woods, life can go on as usual for the most part. We still visit neighbors, get groceries, and participate in a couple extracurricular activities that have put pandemic precautions in place. Schools have been in session all year in Arkansas with little to no problems. My husband is a wildland firefighter with an often erratic work schedule \\u2014 so with two kids, animals to feed, a garden to plant, meals to make, etc., I'm the one who is mostly at home trying to stay on top of all that. He definitely helps when able, but it's really my load to keep up with. I rarely conquer everything I set out to but try to keep the perspective that our family just being healthy and together is the most important thing. \\\"While my two kids have always played a lot together, this past year has brought it to another level. Yes, there are arguments, but they really have become each other's best friends and are constantly inventing games and play ideas. It's been awesome to see them evolve and strengthen. And as a parent, I enjoy the humor in the ideas they come up with, like my son taking a ride across the ice.\\\" \\u2014Terra Fondriest, Arkansas For more original interviews about photography, sign up for our photo newsletter, JPG"},{"author":"Pia Peterson","title":"10 Photo Stories That Will Challenge Your View Of The World","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/piapeterson\/photo-stories-march-13","content":"This week, you may have heard, marked one year since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic \\u2014 a full year that our daily lives in the United States have been disrupted.

As cases swept across the nation, scenes that seemed incredible at the beginning of the pandemic \\u2014 empty streets, long lines, goodbyes over FaceTime, morgue trucks \\u2014 became commonplace in the United States. Other things that seemed utterly ordinary last February, like attending a sports game or showing your face in public, are still relatively rare. Even for those lucky enough to be somewhat less affected, the year was still hard, as families juggled remote work and homeschool and individuals navigated long-term isolation. The pandemic has profoundly impacted our society, highlighting our inequalities along racial and class lines and offering up opportunities to do better.

In Japan, club sports are a large part of adolescence and how many students bond with their classmates. Sumo \\u2014 a historical Japanese martial art and longtime favorite sport in the country \\u2014 is open solely to men at the professional level, but that doesn\\u2019t stop some girls from practicing it as a club sport. Tokyo-based photographer Yulia Skogoreva has been photographing girls and young women who practice sumo for years. \\u201CThe traditions in Japan are complicated,\\u201D says Skogoreva. \\u201CWhen people come and visit the country, this is part of why they love it so much, because so much of that tradition is still intact. But there\\u2019s also the question of gender equality, and can we figure out a way to have both?\\u201D Abe\\u2019s dream is to continue her career as a professional, but right now there is no way for women to continue after graduation from university in the current system. Female sumo wrestlers at the club level are passionate about the sport and give their sweat and tears to prove that they deserve to compete. \\u201CI wish that these girls could have the opportunity to continue their career,\\u201D says Skogoreva. \\u201CAt the moment even in Japan very few people know that female sumo exists. I hope that my project will help these girls to get more attention and reach their goal one day.\\u201D Skogoreva, who has lived in Japan for over 10 years, understands the dream of professional athleticism, and her goal is to capture movement and space in a still image. She grew up in Moscow and frequently went to see ballet. She ended up in Tokyo to study at Nippon Photography Institute and continued to photograph dance. \\u201CI like the natural state of people moving,\\u201D Skogoreva says. \\u201CDancers forget about the camera, they just do what they do. I started seeing dance moves when I watched all kinds of sports.\\u201D She was especially interested in sumo, which has many rituals ahead of the fights that can often look like dance \\u2014 the professional wrestlers sometimes approach the ring in colorful dress that shows their rank, and competitors assemble on the dohyō (the raised ring) ahead of the match to stomp and show off in a choreographed ritual ceremony called the \\u201Cdohyō iri.\\u201D Skogoreva was originally curious about the world of male sumo wrestlers, because she had never heard of women taking up the sport. Then a friend sent her an article about a female sumo wrestler, and her interest was piqued. \\u201CIt\\u2019s an incredibly tight-knit and closed-off world. It took more than a year to get the permissions to photograph there. I reached out to Russian wrestlers, and then when I came back to Tokyo with photographs of Russian wrestlers, it became a lot easier.\\u201D She plans to keep working on the project, photographing sumo wrestlers in Japan and elsewhere, as well as continuing to photograph Nana and her older sister, Sakura. \\u201CThey\\u2019re growing and changing every year.

For many people interested in photography, even those who are too far away to visit her exhibitions in New York, Meister is a familiar face. Her popular online course \\u201CSeeing Through Photographs\\u201D has lit a spark for countless students. She is generous with her knowledge and time, and she always leaves you inspired to dig further, whether it\\u2019s looking at books or experimenting with your own work. In May of this year, she will become the executive director of Aperture, where she will serve as the main creative force behind the renowned international photo magazine and book imprint. Not bad for someone who said, \\u201CIt wasn\\u2019t until I was in college that I realized I had no talent as a photographer, and I\\u2019d be better off studying photography as a discipline within art history.\\u201D We asked her about 12 photographs that have influenced her career as a curator, and did she ever deliver.\\u201CMany moons ago, I wrote my undergraduate thesis on Danny Lyon, and I suspect that experience had a lot to do with how I managed to persuade MoMA to hire me right out of college. Lyon made this photograph shortly after joining the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee as its first staff photographer, and it circulated widely as a poster with the word \\u2018NOW\\u2019 superimposed in the top right corner \\u2014 alas, a message as urgent today as it was then. One of Lyon\\u2019s photographs (from his series on the Texas prison system in the late 1960s) is currently on view within Gallery 409 in the collection Gordon Parks and \\u2018The Atmosphere of Crime.\\u2019\\u201D\\u201CThis is a page from a unique album of Burckhardt\\u2019s photographs in the Museum Collection, which became the cover image of my first book at MoMA in 2002, accompanying an installation at MoMA QNS, when the Museum had temporarily relocated to Queens. My admiration and affection continue unabated. Upon his arrival in the United States in 1935, Burckhardt apparently felt so overwhelmed by the frenetic pace of Manhattan; his photographs might best be described as shy downward glances. By 1940, he mustered the confidence to squarely address Astoria, which was then sparsely populated, and in many ways this project did the same for me.\\u201D \\u201CProjects 78: Sabine Hornig opened at MoMA QNS in July 2003, less than three weeks after the birth of our first child, so I can\\u2019t help but feel emotionally attached to her subtle critique of the architecture of consumerism. I\\u2019m not traveling these days \\u2014 but when I begin again, I look forward to seeing Hornig\\u2019s monumental installation for the Public Art Fund at LaGuardia Airport, which was unveiled just weeks before the whole world seemed to shut down last March.\\u201D\\u201CAlthough by 2013 I had organized a handful of exhibitions and collection installations and worked on a number of books, Bill Brandt: Shadow and Light was really the first exhibition where I felt I was adding to the conversation in a meaningful way. Roberta Smith\\u2019s review appeared on the front page of the Arts section of the New York Times. And as if that wasn\\u2019t enough, she wrote that the exhibition had been \\u2018organized with sharp acumen\\u2019 by yours truly. I think I floated on air for a week.\\u201D \\u201COne of the things I\\u2019ll miss most is the pursuit of acquisitions that can shift the stories we can tell about the history of art. It\\u2019s a combination of detective work and diplomacy, rewarded by the thought of what future generations will do with these images. On a tip from a dear MoMA colleague, I reached out to Robert McNeill\\u2019s daughter in 2013, and we spent an unforgettable day in the hallway of a self-storage space outside of Washington, DC, listening and looking and learning and (ultimately) selecting 23 prints that suggested the depth and breadth of his achievement. I\\u2019m absolutely delighted by the frequency with which these have been displayed or published since then. Two are currently on view in Gallery 510, in the collection A Modern Media World.\\u201D\\u201CAnother beloved acquisition is a suite of 10 unique photo collages by the ceaselessly inventive Josef Albers, which he likely assembled just before the Bauhaus (where he was teaching at the time) was forced to leave its Dessau campus. MoMA published a book of this work in 2016 (with this image on the cover), and I organized a small accompanying exhibition. I\\u2019m in awe of Albers\\u2019 creativity within boundaries that would (for most) squash all possibilities of original expression, whether in his better-known series of paintings and prints known as Homage to the Square or these marvelous photo collages that were never published in his lifetime.\\u201D\\u201CIt wasn\\u2019t until I was in college that I realized I had no talent as a photographer, and I\\u2019d be better off studying photography as a discipline within art history. In 2016, I had the opportunity to host a Quora session (Viewed by 1.4 million people! How is that possible?) in which, following a question about amateur practices, I shared this photograph I had made in high school of my two younger sisters. I was very flattered when one person who participated in the session later called the museum to see if I\\u2019d be willing to sell it! (I wasn\\u2019t\\u2026)\\u201D \\u201CDorothea Lange\\u2019s most famous photograph, \\u2018Migrant Mother,\\u2019 only became known as such in December 1952, when it was published in Modern Photography magazine alongside an article written by her son, Daniel Dixon. The title listed here is the one that accompanied its first publication in the New York Times (from this very print!). Other published titles were rife with contradictions and inaccuracies. I learned all about this while writing a little book about this image in 2018. The relationship between this picture and the many words associated with it was the inspiration for Dorothea Lange: Words & Pictures, an exhibition I organized last year. Encouraged by MoMA\\u2019s Creative Team, I also wrote a little illustrated history of this story for Magazine, MoMA\\u2019s online platform.\\u201D\\u201CBetween working on these two Lange projects, I had the privilege of being responsible for the publication of Frances Benjamin Johnston\\u2019s Hampton Album. (Four plates from this album are on view in Gallery 502 in a collection titled Early Photography and Film.) Johnston was a white woman photographing at a school that had been founded shortly after the Civil War for newly freed enslaved people and (soon thereafter) Indigenous Americans. I knew I wanted to hear LaToya Ruby Frazier\\u2019s perspective on this work and to include it in the book. I couldn\\u2019t have anticipated that just a few weeks before we sat down to look at these photographs together, she was in Georgia, thinking about the \\u2018separate and unequal\\u2019 education systems there.\\u201D\\u201CEvery once in a while as a curator, you find an opportunity to work with an artist outside the usual channels. When MoMA knew it was going to need to close during summer 2019, in anticipation of opening our expanded and reimagined collection galleries that fall, someone asked if I could think of a photographer who might want to engage with some aspect of the inside of the museum and help us share it on the outside during this period. We asked Rosalind Fox Solomon and Sara Cwynar (to my delight, this image is now on view in Gallery 209), and you can read about their projects here. Fun fact: Both Rosalind and Sara were featured at MoMA PS1 in the 2015 Greater New York exhibition.\\u201D\\u201CAs I\\u2019m writing this, I\\u2019m struck by how many of the photographs that have been important to me over the course of my career are currently on view at the museum, including this one, in a gallery that takes \\u2018The Atmosphere of Crime\\u2019 (Gordon Parks\\u2019s 1957 photo essay for Life magazine) as its point of departure. With the instrumental partnership of the Gordon Parks Foundation, we published a book of this unforgettable work last spring that included essays by Bryan Stevenson and Nicole Fleetwood. Parks\\u2019s camera was his \\u2018weapon of choice\\u2019 in the fight against poverty, racism, and discrimination. His conviction that photography could be a catalyst for change continues to inspire me (and countless others).\\u201D \\u201COn May 8, 2021, Fotoclubismo: Brazilian Modernist Photography, 1946\\u20131964 will open to the public \\u2014 my last exhibition as a MoMA curator. As bittersweet as this feels, I couldn\\u2019t be more thrilled to introduce the work of this São Paulo\\u2013based amateur photo club to audiences outside of Brazil and to reflect on the structural hierarchies that have led to their exclusion (to date) from international histories of 20th-century art. This image is featured on the cover of the gorgeous catalog, which expands upon the ideas of the exhibition\\u2026just in case you can\\u2019t make it to Midtown Manhattan before it closes on Sept. 26!\\u201D "},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Gay Tweets Of The Week - 4\/19\/21","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/ryanschocket2\/gay-tweets-from-this-week-april19","content":"And be sure to follow these tweeters for an A+ timeline!"},{"author":"Unknown","title":"18 Famous People Who Are Pansexual","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/mjs538\/pansexual-celebrities","content":"GLAAD says, \\\"While being bisexual means being attracted to more than one gender, being pansexual means being attracted to all gender identities, or attracted to people regardless of gender.\\\""},{"author":"Unknown","title":"This Doctor Works To Increase LGBT Representation In Medicine","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/alexalisitza\/lgbtqia-representation-in-medicine","content":"TikTok videos not playing for you?

From the minute they shared their first scene together, you could feel how special these characters were, and it has been a privilege to watch their characters on screen and to watch these two actors grow off screen. To celebrate the Wynonna Earp Season 4 finale, Dominique and Katherine sat down with us to chat about everything \\u2014 like what it was like filming the highly anticipated WayHaught wedding, what filming the Season 4 finale felt like, what they are most proud of, and much more. Here's everything we learned:Katherine Barrell (Nicole Haught): One of my favorite memories of shooting was actually looking out at all of the chairs and seeing the names of all the characters. It was such a lovely, reflective, full-circle moment. We got to not only acknowledge having this amazing wedding that we'd been looking forward to for these characters for so long, but also getting to honor all the characters that have been part of their lives up until that point. That was one of my favorite moments of that day. We also had such beautiful weather, and it was such a lovely day. Everyone was there and dressed up. It felt very, very celebratory, which I really loved. Dominique Provost-Chalkley (Waverly Earp): It couldn't have worked out any better. Like, the sun was shining and it was so beautiful. I remember the day before we filmed the ceremony, and we went to just see the preparations of the wedding and I had this really deep feeling of like, Waverly would be so happy right now. Of course, Nicole too, but I was seeing it and living it through Waverly. When we had been on panels and had been asked the question of, \\\"What would the perfect WayHaught wedding look like?\\\" Like, they achieved it. Every single detail was exactly as we would have liked. And, for me personally, I just felt like the dress that Waverly wore, the way she wore it, the hair, like everything was so in alignment with who she is and how she would have wanted it to go. It felt perfect. And, like Kat said, looking out and seeing all those names and just feeling so emotional. It's really sort of looking at the journey that we've all been on as a family and as a show. It was really quite special. BuzzFeed: Were the names on the chairs in the script or was that something you saw for the first time when you arrived on set? DPC: I hadn't seen it in the script. KB: No, I don't think it was. I think it was an Emily [Andras, the show's creator] and art department decision that was made and it was so perfect. I can't imagine it any other way. I loved the sentiment of it. I just loved the names and I thought it was so perfect. DPC: For me, it was a whole range of mixed emotions. It's funny, I remember, we talked about this, Kat, you were like, \\\"I just really hope that I'm in the pocket,\\\" I think you called it. Like, feeling really aligned and grounded. Sometimes while filming you feel really in it and on it, and sometimes you feel a little bit off. I remember the days running up to the ceremony I felt in it and on it, and then, the day after I felt really good, but the day of filming, I can't deny that I felt this sense of pressure that I put on myself. Like, this is so important and if I had seen something like this when I was younger, like, what that would've done. So, it was really feeling the weight of the responsibility for the queer community to make sure I get it right. That is something I'm always working on, just releasing this pressure I put on myself. So, there was a little bit of that energy, for me, in there. KB: What you said, Dom, about the weight of how important it was and how much it will mean to so many people, you try to let that go because it can be such a crippling feeling at the same time, like it's such a double-edged sword, that feeling. We've talked about it over the years with a lot of the stuff that we've done, especially with WayHaught, but that day I felt a real sense of trust with the way that the story was written, the way everything looked. I was like, \\\"Yeah, we've got it. It's all there.\\\"BuzzFeed: Also, it must've been amazing to share the wedding moment not only as your characters, but just as a cast. DPC: I think there was such a range of, \\\"I can't believe we're here doing this. Look at all my friends. Look at how happy everyone looks.\\\" Seeing Varun [Saranga] right there doing this beautiful speech for us and the sun being out. It really was so special. And then, afterwards, when we got to do the scenes post-ceremony where we just got to play and dance around. That was probably one of the funnest things that I've ever filmed because it was just us as friends actually having a party and celebrating the years of madness that we've all experienced together. KB: I feel the same way. I loved the celebratory aspect of it and that it really felt like as a group we got to just have a party and have those moments. I love that we got those moments of improv at the end of the ceremony because it allowed us to just play and laugh, and have some really authentic connections. It was really fun to shoot those scenes and I just remember feeling so happy for the characters too. DPC: She was so cute, wasn't she, Kat? KB: She was really cute. It was a really big thing and she took a lot on with that. She really wanted to do her best and feel really great about it. It's a lot to come onto an established show with all of these other actors and you're meeting everyone for the first time, everything is new, and then it's like, \\\"Okay, now sing.\\\" And, on top of that, it wasn't just any song, it was THE song. She really took it with grace. I hate saying I'm \\\"proud\\\" because \\\"proud,\\\" to me, always seems like, \\\"Oh, I'm so proud of you.\\\" I don't ever want it to seem condescending, but I was just very proud. DPC: Interesting you say that because I also have a complex relationship with the word \\\"proud,\\\" but I actually think that we need to reclaim it because, I agree with you, there's this notion of, I don't want it to come across as condescending in any way, but being proud of someone is so beautiful. Like, pride is great. There's that other side of it, but if you're saying it from the intention of, \\\"I love being proud of my friends,\\\" it's quite beautiful. I hope that people are proud of me when I achieve something. You're sharing that moment with them of like, \\\"You did it. This is awesome.\\\" I think that's exactly how we felt watching Martina too. KB: Oh, it was so hard. I had a good cry after that. I don't know what it is with Greg, but he gets me right in the feels every time. I have such a soft spot for him in my heart. So, having that scene between Nicole and Nedley, and knowing that it was possibly our last scene together ever, it just hit on a different level. Like, when you have a last scene with everyone it hits on a different level, but with Greg it was just different. I think it's because Nedley means so much to Nicole and it was a very beautiful moment. It was fantastic and I had a hard time getting through that one, for sure.DPC: It was really special. When I read it, I was weeping my eyes out, like you say, it just totally broke me. So, I expected that energy to be really present while filming, but what I actually felt was, because Mel was so emotional, it was Waverly's time to be strong. It was her time to be the stronger sister and to really let Wynonna know that this is her time. I'm getting shivers all over just talking about this. It reminded me of when I was younger and my mom had moved because she had met my dad. Then, eventually, they broke up and stuff and there was a moment where I was like, \\\"You need to continue traveling. You should go do that.\\\" It's that feeling of, like, you need to not only say the words, but you need to show that you're going to be okay without that person. Like, I'm an adult now and I have my life, and this is your time to go and be. I thought it was so well-written and it just comes at such a perfect moment. It's actually a really pivotal Waverly moment that shows her growth of taking on that stronger role, rather than always being the one that needs to be looked after and needs to be saved. It was her way of telling Wynonna, \\\"I've got this.\\\" It was so generous and beautiful and it really encapsulates their relationship and the sisterly bond that we share. [laughing] Okay, and one quick little story. When I read the script, at the end there's this line where Waverly says, \\\"We have phones, ding dong,\\\" and I had read it and was like, \\\"ding dong,\\\" like ringing a doorbell. Mel literally lost it. We couldn't stop laughing and it actually ended up being the perfect thing to have because when I said it, we thought about how often I do that, where I read something totally wrong and she has to correct me. So there's also this nice Melanie and Dom moment in there when we were hugging because we are crying but also laughing. It was really beautiful. DPC: Charlotte is a beautiful human being and the joy really came from watching her and Mel interacting. They have been friends for a while and Mel has been talking about getting Charlotte on the show for a long time and wanting her to come. So, it was like finally she got to play with her friend and they just spent so much time laughing. Mel not being able to keep it together when watching Charlotte was so fun. She's just a beautiful person and it felt like she could have easily been a regular on the show. Her energy just fit really well. KB: I never even met her. We were never in on the same day. I'm so sad about it. KB: I remember saying that we had never done a scene like that before together. Ever. We had never done a work, like break down a case, scene. That's usually something that Waverly does with Jeremy or sometimes Wynonna, and if Nicole's ever done it, it has been with Nedley. But we'd never done a scene like that together, so it was really fun and it was so new. I remember having a lot of fun with Varun in that scene too. The pop up from the bed was really fun. It was a scene where the three of us were just having a really good time and laughing. That's what always amazes me about the show is how they can write these episodes that have so much emotional depth to them, but at the same time they slip in these hilarious little moments. I love the show for that because I think it's so unique and so rare.KB: I really felt it. I really felt the change. I think it's such a beautiful episode and I'm so happy with the storylines. Emily said it in another interview, but hopefully there will be some version of this story in the future, I don't know what that looks like. I'm always trying to keep the faith alive, however, I was very conscious to say goodbye, like for my own heart, because it was really important to me that if it was the last, to put things to bed. I was telling Dom earlier that I actually walked the blocking of that first scene I had ever shot, which is Waverly and Nicole meeting in Shorty's. So, just for myself, I re-walked that exact path, those steps, and said a little prayer, for lack of a better word. Just a little thank-you to the universe for the opportunity and for the experience. I wanted myself to be at peace no matter what happens, so that was really important for me. I'm not gonna lie, for me, this finale felt different and I really wanted to make sure that no matter what happens, that I had peace for myself, and I felt very at peace with the story. It was a way that I had not felt at the end of any other season. DPC: I couldn't agree more, Kat. I felt exactly the same. There was an energy of...it felt final. Like you say, Kat, that's not to say that there isn't going to be more Wynonna, like that will be brilliant if there is, but I remember we spoke about this when we were on set, how it would be better to treat it as if it is the end and then have a little extra bonus, rather than holding on to hope and then feeling the disappointment of not having said goodbye. Truly living moment by moment and the moment that was presented really did feel like a finale. Maybe it's just the end of a chapter, but I wanted to live that fully and accept it because it possibly being the end was really present [on set]. But there's no part of us that can complain, because it really was a perfect episode. Like Kat said, if it had been another season, I think it would have felt incomplete, whereas this really just felt like surrendering to this beautiful story that got told and tied up in a bow. Like, what more could we really want for both ourselves and for the fans if this really is the end? BuzzFeed: As a fan, it felt so complete, and if this is the end, it ended on a perfect episode. KB: Exactly. I remember sitting in my apartment and reading the script, and having a cry and being like, \\\"Wow, okay.\\\" It was so perfectly done and so beautifully handled.DPC: It was, honestly, the weirdest, craziest, just completely bananas situation. I still can't quite believe it. When we watched Episode 10, like oh my god, it was so intense. BuzzFeed: Wait, Dom, had you not seen Episode 10 before it aired and we were all live tweeting? DPC: That was the first time I'd seen it! What I really liked about [Episode 10] was seeing the transformation from light Waverly to dark Waverly. It really made me think about the shadows that are in all of us. You know, we all have darkness and we all have light. They both exist in all of us, and in this situation, we were really seeing the extremes of it. I really loved the fact that we were able to see that and allow that to fully come through in Waverly, even if it was really, really, really intense. It was a really intense couple of episodes to film. It wasn't all fun and games doing that stuff. You kind of have to tap into that part of yourself and just accessing those pieces is tough. So, it was a nice relief to then go to the wedding and not have to be in that intensity. I got to go back to just lovey dovey, happiness, and find the light again. KB: Yeah, because living with that intensity for so long is tough. Like you said, you have to go to a place you aren't used to. I do remember having a laugh when we were shooting the stuff on the stairs for Episode 11. It was just so heightened and so intense, but the thing with that stuff that I find so challenging is you have to, in your mind, be like, \\\"Okay, there's gonna be special effects. There's gonna be epic music.\\\" You know what I mean? Because in the moment, I feel ridiculous. Like, we were having this huge moment and I'm looking at you\\u2014 DPC: \\\"I'm the angel shield!\\\" KB: Yes, that exact moment! I've got this big speech and you've got these big wings and you're getting blown back. I just remember us laughing and being like, \\\"This is so intense.\\\" It's such a funny thing with working in a fantasy realm, especially because there's so much you have to imagine. But, in my memory, Dom, we shot the wedding at the beginning of the block. We had this celebratory thing, and I remember being like, \\\"Oh, now we have to film [Episode] 11.\\\" DPC: Oh, yeah! BuzzFeed: So you really filmed out of order. KB: Yeah, because I wished that we had done the wedding last. DPC: Yes, because it felt like the end before the end. KB: I remember we had a week of some of the heavier stuff left. DPC: I just remember the last day [filming] on the Homestead was that beautiful day where we were putting Mel in the car. Was that my last scene? KB: The last scene that I shot was in studio. It was in Shorty's with the four of us. It was the ending of [Episode] 11. It was mine, and I'm pretty sure it was also Varun's last scene. And then, you, Tim [Rozon], and Mel had one more day where you were doing wedding stuff with the dressmaker. DPC: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Thank you for jogging my memory. We were out in that beautiful location. It feels like a lifetime ago.DPC: There are a few different moments. One of them, for me, would be the Jolene stuff. So, the \\\"I'm here and I stay\\\" scene and then also seeing Waverly in [Season 4] Episode 10 and seeing how she interacted with Jolene and seeing the difference. I felt like there was a strength the second time, and what I really tried to embody in that round two with Zoie [Palmer] and I, was like, \\\"I know you now, and you're not going to fuck with me.\\\" When thinking about the representation of mental health, it's like, \\\"You're not going to get me. You're not gonna get in my head in the same way.\\\" There was a real resistance the second time. Waverly's been through this before and she was like, \\\"I'm not going to allow you to affect me in the same way.\\\" Seeing that episode, I was like...I'm not sure pride is necessarily the word, but just a sense of knowing my intention came through in some way. It felt really nice and felt really good. Just being with Zoie is such an honor. She's such a good actress and playing that character was such a big thing for her. So, as an actress and an artist, just being like, \\\"Oh, that was really cool,\\\" that I did those scenes and it meant something. I feel like it meant a lot to me because of the representation of mental health and the journey that I have been on with that and with Waverly. The second thing, I would say, is just the queer representation that Kat and I have really been on such a journey with. It has been amazing, and the scenes that stand out are like the first scene that you filmed, Kat. I'm really proud of that scene because we were just little babies. KB: We were little babies! DPC: We just went all in, straight away. Like, I remember filming it and your energy was affecting my energy. It was this really magical moment of coming together. Then, of course, the Nedley's couch scene and then the wedding. All of these WayHaught moments felt really important. Just being able to represent this relationship on screen for the queer community is huge. I feel so lucky that we got to experience their relationship together.KB: I think, just to echo exactly what you said about the queer representation, I think about all the little moments that will stand out and will hopefully be inspirations for other creators in the future. Like, I'm really proud to have been a part of certain scenes with Dom. I think they were really important and will be held up as beacons of inspiration for years to come. And, I think for me, I really learned how to trust myself on Wynonna Earp. Just letting stuff go if it wasn't perfect or exactly the way I wanted to do it. I learned a lot of that from Mel. Just learning from Mel about the beautiful power of spontaneity, being present, and leaving room to be brave enough to surprise yourself in your work as an artist. I think I really struggled for many, many years of feeling like everything had to be polished because that's the training that I grew in and letting that go was a journey for me over the course of Wynonna Earp. Just being inspired by my colleagues every single day on this show and leaving room for play was a really big thing that I'm proud of personally. The growth that I've seen in myself, both as a human being with my work and on a personal level, is huge."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"23 Ways Men Have Described Being Sexually Harassed","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/stephenlaconte\/ways-men-experience-sexual-harassment-reddit","content":"\\u2014Mediocre_pil0t\\u2014RedJ_99\\u2014HugMyEyebrows\\u2014ryguy1205\\u2014whyspir\\u2014PrimePrecision\\u2014Jasonsg83\\u2014yutoputo\\u2014dougalg\\u2014firdausbaik19\\u2014chiefboldface\\u2014Ralph_from_nowhere\\u2014BellsBeerBestBeer\\u2014GoddamnitMcnulty\\u2014Justindr0107\\u2014PopotInhaDoceNote: Some responses have been edited for length and\\\/or clarity."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Nicole Maines On Supergirl And Playing A Trans Superhero","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/noradominick\/nicole-maines-supergirl-season-6-interview","content":"For the last three years, Nicole Maines has brought a beloved Supergirl character to life and showcased the importance of representation on TV. With her role as Nia Nal\\\/Dreamer, Nicole has given the transgender community a \\\"fully fledged superhero,\\\" and it has been incredible to watch. To celebrate the final season of Supergirl, Nicole sat down with us to chat about everything \\u2014 like what she hopes fans take away from watching Nia's story, what it's like being a superhero, her favorite Avatar: The Last Airbender episodes, and more. Here's everything we chatted about:1. I love being able to, of course, give this icon to our community and to give us our own superhero that we can feel really proud of and we can identify with. 2. All of the scenes I get to do with Jesse [Rath]. He's brilliant. Those scenes are so much fun, and we have so much good stuff coming up this season, I cannot wait for people to see. 3. I love every time she gets a new power. In the Season 6 premiere, everyone was going bonkers about her astral projection and being able to interact with something physically while she's in the astral form. BuzzFeed: Did you know from the start what her powers would be? Or have you been learning them as you go? I don't usually know about her powers in advance, but it has been really cool. Dreamer has gone from being Nura Nal's ancestor, kind of based off Dream Girl, and I think Dreamer has moved into her own space. She's kind of like if Dream Girl had Psylocke's powers, or she's like if Green Lantern could see the future. I remember reading about the energy blasts for the first time in Season 4, and I was texting everybody. I was like, \\\"I get to shoot things out of my hands!\\\" They don't really tell me what it's going to look like [with the special effects]. Also, they don't really tell me what to do with my hands, how to hold myself, and what the blasts look like, so it's really a lot of me in my apartment trying to come up with it. I loosely based it off of the waterbenders in Avatar: The Last Airbender and that ethereal one move into the other, but she also has this aggression to her. I've likened it to Uncle Iroh's way of firebending too. And, these days, with the massive success of WandaVision, I'm just trying not to look like I'm ripping off Scarlet Witch with my hands. Now, I've never been so conscious of bending my fingers, especially my ring finger. Now I'm like, \\\"Keep your hands out or else people are going to think you're Wanda!\\\" BuzzFeed: I love that you're just hyperaware of Elizabeth Olsen's Wanda moves now. Totally! She's amazing and I'm just sitting here thinking, \\\"Girl, I'm sorry. I'm really trying not to steal your gig or rip off your moves or anything.\\\" I'm really hyperaware of it now. We just shot a scene where it's a close-up of my hands, and I was thinking the whole time, \\\"Extend your fingers, don't bend a single one. Try not to channel Elizabeth Olsen.\\\"4. Next, I love her suit. I think she looks so cool. All of the suits are textured and they have all of these raised patterns and stuff on them. I remember when they were first going through and the costume designer, Victoria [J. Auth], was showing me all of these different patterns and swatches she pulled, and I was like, \\\"I like this and that and that and that.\\\" I pretty much picked the gay sci-fi ones. You know, I think Nia has a brand to uphold. 5. And likewise, I love her wardrobe. I think Nia has really settled and I can't wait for people to see some of the looks she wears this season. She's totally taken off in this boho chic style. She's been on a fashion journey. I'll say, she's had some hits and she's had some wide misses. But this season, I think she's settled into this really cool fashion space. So, I'm loving that. I've been desperately trying to steal many things.1. First one, and they all count as one: Icy, Darcy, and Stormy from The Winx Club. Growing up, those were my girls. I loved them. You ever need someone to play Darcy, you call me. I will be there in a flash. I have the costume. [laughs] Could you imagine if I showed up [to an audition] already made up like Darcy? 2. Shego from Kim Possible. She was really awesome and such a complex female character. 3. Azula from Avatar: The Last Airbender. Again, a badass female character. BuzzFeed: I love that Avatar has impacted your life so much. Do you have a favorite episode or storyline from the series? I mean, Ember Island had to be one of the best episodes. Also, \\\"The Southern Raiders,\\\" when Katara and Zuko go on their trip together. That moment when Katara stops the rain, it's perfect. I think those two episodes are my favorite. I've said it before, but \\\"Reality Bytes\\\" from Supergirl, where Dreamer is going on her rampage, that is just our version of \\\"The Southern Raiders.\\\" Supergirl and Dreamer are just Katara and Zuko in that episode. 4. And, okay this is more than four, but Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy. They go together, so I can't separate those two either. BuzzFeed: Have you watched Harley Quinn on HBO Max? I am obsessed. Have I?! Of course! Poison Ivy is the BEST character. Actually, that's a lie, Frank is the best character on that show. He is my hero. I want him to have a spinoff. Petition to have Frank in the DC movies. Next Harley Quinn movie, I really need Frank the plant in there. BuzzFeed: Honestly, I think we all need Margot Robbie interacting with Frank. Totally. Can you imagine Margot just hanging out with a giant talking plant? I need it.1. Honestly, my favorite memories are just hanging out. Someone will always eventually start singing. We don't have our green room anymore because of COVID, but before, we had this great green room and we would just have Lego sets. Melissa [Benoist] was gifted the Millennium Falcon set and it had like 1,000 pieces or something. Just watching that slowly get put together was really, really cool. Just coming in every day and being like, \\\"How much progress has Mel made?\\\" It was really just essentially her working on it too. So, just watching Supergirl sitting on a couch building the Millennium Falcon has got to be a highlight for me. 2. Also, being part of such a female-centered series is just a behind-the-scenes highlight in itself. We have our little \\\"Nikazie\\\" hashtag on Instagram and Twitter [\\\"Nikazie\\\" being a combo of Nicole Maines, Katie McGrath, and Azie Tesfai's names]. It has been really great to form this sisterhood with the other girls because, I think, Vancouver is especially lonely sometimes. It's hard to make friends, so it's been really, really nice to have the other castmates to be able to hang out with. We have our true crime nights and we just sit on the couch and drink wine and order tacos. One of my favorite memories was watching the Lorena Bobbitt documentary together. That was a lot of fun. Also, especially this season with filming during COVID, we're not really allowed to hang out with anybody else, so it's been really, really nice to see the cast all the time. Staz [Nair] always comes over and we do our Mario Kart nights. He beat me for the first time since we started playing a couple of months ago, and I was a combination of proud and being like, \\\"Next time, I'll bury you.\\\"3. And there are so many memories from when we shoot at Riverview, which is like a hospital and it's notoriously haunted. One time, someone caught something on video and I will never go back there. I wasn't on set that day, but I got the tea later on. Every time we film there and [the crew] is just like, \\\"Do you guys want to hang out on set? Want to go back to the trailers?\\\" I'm always like, \\\"I'm going home.\\\" Queer people survive horror movies because we are not in horror movies. We do not mess with ghosts. There is enough trying to hurt us in the real world, we do not need things outside of the mortal coil trying to hurt us too. But yeah, I always think of just the wild stuff that has happened while filming in that haunted hospital and I never need to return to it.1. I know this is kind of sacrilege, but I just watched My Neighbor Totoro for the first time and it's already one of my favorites. It's amazing and Mei is a queen. I've always loved animation, cartoons, and anime, so I'd recommend this movie to anyone. 2. I was a big Disney kid growing up, so The Incredibles is another one of my go-to movies. It's kind of fun to be a superhero now because The Incredibles was everything to me. I think, personally, I'm at just the right age for when they inevitably do the live-action The Incredibles reboot, so I will hopefully be able to play Elastigirl. I will have reached my final form if that happens. I'll roll up in the costume for that audition too and they'll be like, \\\"Really? It's a little much,\\\" and I'll just say, \\\"Really? I don't think it's enough.\\\"1. That we are not limited by our gender identity. That who we are and how other people perceive us does not, in any way, determine what we can or cannot do with our lives. We can do and can be whoever we want. The bar is now set very, very high, because if you can be a superhero, you can be anything. It's like, \\\"Well, if I can be a superhero, everything else is very easily within reach.\\\" So, that's what I hope people take away from seeing Nia. Also, for folks who are not trans, I hope they learn from me that trans people are more than what's in our pants. We are more than our trauma. We're more than our gender. We are just fully fledged superheroes, who have an arc outside of our transness. BuzzFeed: I always think about the monumental moment when Dreamer comes out to the world in Season 4 and what a big step for superhero media that was. How much input did you have in Nia's storylines on Supergirl? That first one [Dreamer coming out on TV], I didn't have as much input on. They kind of wrote that one themselves, but when I read it, they wrote it perfectly. That was a perfect moment. The funny thing about that speech is I actually was very, very hesitant to out Nia as a Gryffindor. I knew it was going to be a point of contention because I know by looking at her, a lot of people are gonna think she's a Hufflepuff. And, of course, as a Slytherin myself, I didn't want her to be a Gryffindor. But she is kind of ruled by this bravery and courage, and the leadership she possesses, and her willingness to throw herself into harm's way to protect her loved one. So, I literally went and took the Pottermore test as Nia and got Gryffindor, that's how invested I was in making sure that small moment in this huge, important speech was right. But for \\\"Reality Bytes\\\" [an episode where Nia confronts a man who is targeting the transgender community] and for Nia's confrontation with her sister, I had a little more input. Usually, at any point when Nia's transness has come up, I have the opportunity to talk about that a little bit and work with the writers, so I can nudge them in different directions or let them know if they're on the right track. They've been really, really good about coming to me and respecting what I have to say.BuzzFeed: And now, you're writing a comic book story featuring Dreamer for DC Pride and get to really craft her storylines. How is that going? I've kind of become drunk on my own power, I'm not gonna lie. I'm kind of like, \\\"I AM DREAMER.\\\" I keep having to remind myself I am not actually a superhero in real life. I said I love Dreamer's superpowers, and with the comic, I've maybe sprinkled in a few new things in there for fun. I'm having such a blast. Although I'm worried I may have made her a \\\"Mary Sue,\\\" but you know what? Superman has super strength, super speed, heat vision, X-ray vision, frost breath, super hearing, invulnerability, he can survive in space, he can fly, and he's bulletproof, so I don't care. Trans folks have one person, so Dreamer can do whatever she wants."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Sex Workers Share Their Saddest Customer Stories On Reddit","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/stephenlaconte\/sex-workers-share-saddest-stories-reddit","content":"\\u2014sonofhellboy993\\u2014scummish\\u2014tinymountains\\u2014angelofjag\\u2014Longjumping-fun8908\\u2014smokeyxxx\\u2014AlenaLaskova\\u2014PressureAwkward\\u2014fishboy1\\u2014smokeandshadowsNote: Some responses have been edited for length and\\\/or clarity."},{"author":"Unknown","title":"Gay Tweets Of The Week - 4\/5\/21","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/ryanschocket2\/gay-tweets-from-this-week-april5","content":"And be sure to follow these tweeters for an A+ timeline!"},{"author":"Liz Oyer","title":"Opinion: Incarcerated People Need Protection From COVID","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/lizoyer\/coronavirus-incarcerated-vaccines","content":"As a public defender, my job is to represent poor people charged with crimes. I\\u2019ve always had many clients behind bars. But the wall between us was never impermeable until COVID-19 hit. Before the pandemic, I visited my jailed clients several times a week. I advocated for them in courtrooms. I worked their cases zealously. When COVID hit, my legal practice came to a screeching halt. Jail visits were abruptly cut off. The courthouse was shut down. As I huddled at home with my family, my clients were essentially sealed into mass isolation within the jail. I felt like I was riding away in a lifeboat, leaving everyone stuck on the ship to sink. None of my clients got sick immediately. Initially, it seemed like the fact that they were isolated from the rest of the world, albeit in miserable conditions, might keep them safe. But staff enter and leave the jails every day, so it was only a matter of time before COVID crept in. When the virus first hit one of our pretrial detention facilities in the spring, it spread like wildfire through the crowded quarters. Our clients were effectively trapped in a burning building. Everything I learned in three years of law school and 15 years of practice suddenly seemed completely useless. I filed motion after motion, trying to get people out of jail \\u2014 and trying to ease my conscience. I had very little success. The pandemic created a sort of Catch-22: Clients at institutions still COVID-free were deemed ineligible for release because the danger to their health was not sufficiently imminent. And clients at institutions with active outbreaks were deemed unsafe to release because of the risk they might carry COVID into the community. As I spun my wheels, more and more of my clients got sick. In June, a healthy, 43-year-old client I\\u2019ll call Alan tested positive for COVID at a jail in Baltimore. He had no symptoms, but was shipped out to Hagerstown to be put in isolation. There, Alan was quarantined in a tent with other prisoners who had tested positive. Alan spent 13 days shackled to a bed in that tent. He was required to urinate in a bed pan. He had no access to a shower. He was not even allowed a phone call to his family to let them know he was alive. I cannot overstate how stressful this time has been for families of incarcerated people. Visitation has been suspended and jails have been abruptly locked down, limiting communications with the outside world. Family members \\u2014 whose hearts are in there with their loved ones \\u2014 are left for days and sometimes weeks at a time imagining the worst. In October, a 53-year-old client I\\u2019ll call Robert was nearing the end of his sentence at a federal prison in Fort Dix, New Jersey, when his roommate became ill with COVID. Prison staff sent the sick man back to the six-person dorm where he shared a bunkbed with Robert. The men were instructed to sleep \\u201Chead to toe\\u201D to reduce the likelihood of transmission. When the prison finally tested the other men, days later, all had COVID. Unsurprisingly, this was just the start of a much larger outbreak: Nearly 1,500 of the 2,500 inmates at Fort Dix have now contracted COVID-19. If a nursing home or hospital managed an outbreak this way, criminal investigations would follow. But when prisoners\\u2019 lives are at stake, we seem content to apply lower standards. By November, all I could think to do was put money on the commissary accounts of the clients I\\u2019d tried and failed to get out, as well as the clients I knew I wouldn\\u2019t be able to get out. MoneyGram made a fortune off my guilt; they charge $8.95 per transaction to send money into federal prisons! I finally won compassionate release for a client this week. It took five months and eight court filings. He\\u2019s 36 years old and has end-stage kidney failure. A doctor told the court he would likely die if he got COVID. I planned to pick him up from the prison in North Carolina. But the Bureau of Prisons put him on a bus before I could get there: a 10-hour ride with four stops in the middle of a pandemic. We continue to incarcerate more people, even as jails and prisons are uncontrolled breeding grounds for this virus. At the federal pretrial detention facility in Baltimore, where many of my clients are housed, one-third of the population has tested positive for COVID since January. The facility is now scrambling, reactively, to take basic precautions that should have been in place many months ago. While Maryland has prioritized vaccinating residents of nursing homes and other congregate facilities, no vaccines have been offered to my clients, who are equally at risk. It has often been said that a nation\\u2019s greatness is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members. We have tools to protect incarcerated people, including compassionate release, home confinement, clemency, and, now, a vaccine. We must use these tools unsparingly \\u2014 or history will judge us harshly for it.

HIV was killing gay men en masse \\u2014 as well as trans women, cis Black women, people injecting drugs, and others \\u2014 and there was no effective treatment, let alone a \\u201Cwarp speed\\u201D effort by the government to fight the spread of the virus with a vaccine. It was a terrifying time to come of age as a gay man. As we begin the year 2021 with a historic vaccination effort, I\\u2019m reflecting on that scary time more than 30 years ago. How deeply I wish we had had a similar commitment by our government and society to fight HIV in the early days, before so many people in my community died. These COVID-19 vaccines were developed and approved in record time, truly a miracle of science. Given that we still don\\u2019t have a vaccine for HIV after over 40 years, we should recognize the COVID-19 vaccine for the gift that it is and the freedom it will bring us. I\\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\\u2019t upsetting to me to learn that nearly 40% of Americans are hesitant about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. We need these vaccines. When I think back to my 17-year-old self, I wonder how different my life as a young gay man could have been if not for HIV. I wonder how many mentors and friends I would still have in my life if we had not lost so many to the virus. I wonder how much less frightening and more joyful it would\\u2019ve been to become sexually active back in 1987. I wonder how many political leaders, artists, business leaders, musicians, authors, and activists could have changed the world had they survived. I was one of the lucky ones, since I was able to remain HIV-negative long enough to benefit from powerful HIV preventive medications. So many others were not. Obviously, HIV and SARS-CoV-2 are very different viruses, and the scientific study of infectious diseases has advanced considerably in the past decades. But we know from recent years that HIV can be effectively treated, to the point where HIV-positive people who take medication consistently are very healthy and cannot transmit the virus to others. We also know that HIV-negative people can take a once-daily pill that almost eliminates their risk of infection. I know this because I take that pill \\u2014 called PrEP \\u2014 every day. These effective approaches to HIV now exist, but it\\u2019s hard to overstate what a horrific job this country and the entire world did in responding to the HIV pandemic in the early years of the crisis. It took five years to develop a reliable HIV antibody test \\u2014 five damn years just to be able to figure out if someone without symptoms has the virus. It took 15 years to develop effective treatments. It took more than 20 years to develop effective treatments that avoid terrible side effects. And it took 30 years to develop that once-daily prevention pill. We still have no vaccine. Our society\\u2019s experience with HIV shows us just how grateful we should be that we have COVID-19 vaccines and that we have them so quickly. And it shows how critical it is for everyone, barring a legitimate health reason, to get a COVID-19 vaccine the minute they\\u2019re eligible. We can\\u2019t afford hesitancy about these shots. People need to think about the big picture. As HIV has taught us, that big picture, without vaccine-created herd immunity, is bleak. Because of malicious anti-vaccination \\u201Cactivists\\u201D \\u2014 many of whom falsely claim that COVID-19 is like the flu and dispute the effectiveness of masks \\u2014 far too many people have been influenced by misinformation and thus harbor vaccine-hesitance. While a small number of people have health conditions that present real barriers to safe vaccination, for the vast majority of people, those health concerns are not applicable. These unfounded concerns risk doing immense harm to public health and our economic recovery. We must always remember that vaccines aren\\u2019t just about protecting ourselves. They\\u2019re also about protecting our family, our friends, our neighbors, and our coworkers \\u2014 our entire community. It\\u2019s about protecting everyone in our lives. It\\u2019s about getting businesses reopened, getting people back to work, getting schools fully up and running, and getting back to normal life. In honor of the massive number of lives we\\u2019ve lost \\u2014 to HIV and to COVID-19 \\u2014 let\\u2019s not take COVID-19 vaccines for granted. It\\u2019s a gift and a miracle that they were developed so quickly. Had society shown the same determination around HIV therapies, preventatives, and vaccines, we\\u2019d be living in a different and better world.Scott Wiener is a gay man and a California state senator representing San Francisco and northern San Mateo County.

The biggest distinction, of course, is that Brett Kavanaugh, the first of Trump\\u2019s nominees to make his senatorial case for a seat on the bench, was credibly accused of sexual assault. Those hearings were extraordinary. Raw. Kavanaugh, red-faced and raging, remains \\u201Cindelible in the hippocampus\\u201D to so many assault survivors who watched the vile pageantry unfold before us those few days, we who have grown up in a society in which boys\\u2019 feelings and ambitions are so often prioritized at girls\\u2019 expense. Judiciary Committee Republicans were eager for a more \\u201Ccivil\\u201D process this time around. In his opening statement earlier this week, Sen. John Kennedy described 2018 as a \\u201Cfreak show,\\u201D choosing a head-scratching metaphor: \\u201CIt looked like the cantina bar scene out of Star Wars.\\u201D Not only were emotions then running sky-high on both sides of the aisle, but protesters had flooded the hallways surrounding the hearing room, some of them wearing the red robes of handmaidens; others sought out senators in other halls of government and pleaded with them to consider their experiences, going viral as a result. This year, the coronavirus pandemic has left those halls silent. What\\u2019s more, as Intelligencer\\u2019s Ed Kilgore points out, \\u201Cthis time the nominee\\u2019s character and personal background are assets, not handicaps.\\u201D While both nominees were Roman Catholics and Federalist Society members, Kilgore writes, \\u201CBarrett\\u2019s background has served as both shield and sword for her proponents in a way that Kavanaugh\\u2019s did not.\\u201D Though Republicans tried defending Kavanaugh as a family man, a \\u201Cfather of daughters\\u201D \\u2014 referencing his time as a girls basketball coach \\u2014 it wasn\\u2019t to nearly the same effect. Conservatives have long accused Democrats of harboring anti-Catholic bias against Barrett, as they claimed was the case during her 2017 hearings for a spot on the 7th Circuit. It\\u2019s a clever move for Republicans, who can cry religious bias should any Democratic senators try to investigate any possible connections between Barrett\\u2019s ardent faith and her views on, say, abortion and marriage equality. (The faith group with which she\\u2019s associated, People of Praise, opposes abortion and expels members for gay sex; Barrett also gave talks to anti-abortion groups in 2013, which she initially failed to disclose to the Senate ahead of her hearing.) The other, perhaps more significant part of her personal background that works quite nicely as both sword and shield: Barrett is a mother. And not just any mother, but a mother who works, returning at the end of the day to a house of seven children, two of whom were adopted from Haiti. Nearly every Republican senator during the hearings mentioned Barrett\\u2019s large brood in an awe-inspired way. She is \\u201Cremarkable,\\u201D the senators told her \\u2014 a \\u201Csuperstar.\\u201D Barrett, for her part, has embraced the supermom narrative. She brought most of her large family to watch the hearings and made clear on the day of her nomination that while she\\u2019s a judge at work, she\\u2019s \\u201Cbetter known back home as a room parent, carpool driver, and birthday party planner.\\u201D Conservative pundits and columnists have crowed that the hysterical, naggy Democrats weren\\u2019t able to \\\"Kavanaugh\\\" a superwoman. The glorified, even fetishized ideal of conservative, religious white womanhood made Barrett an ideal candidate, even before she was memed for not taking any hearing notes, supposedly evidence of her brilliance. The two Republican women on the committee went so far as to insinuate that Barrett\\u2019s Democratic critics were, in fact, being anti-feminist in daring to oppose her nomination. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa told Barrett that the Dems were \\u201Cattacking you as a mom and a woman of faith\\u201D with accusations that are \\u201Cdemeaning to women \\u2026 that you, a working mother of seven with a strong record of professional and academic accomplishment, couldn\\u2019t possibly respect the goals and desires of today\\u2019s women.\\u201D Slate\\u2019s Christina Cauterucci captures the narrative\\u2019s \\u201Cinsidious sexism\\u201D: Ernst\\u2019s implication, that being a mom with a job makes Barrett a friend to women, regardless of how her jurisprudence affects their lives, is exactly the kind of narrow reading of feminism anti-feminists would like to promote: one that encourages prolific motherhood for some while stigmatizing it for others; one that would force women into unwanted childbirth, then abandon them and their children once they\\u2019ve left the womb; one that disregards the unearned privileges and social forces that allow some women to thrive while keeping others in a state of precarious struggle; and one that points to the advancement of certain individual women as evidence that gender discrimination does not exist. This is the conservative savvy of a pick like Barrett: \\u201CShe is the perfect combination of brilliant jurist and a woman who brings the argument to the court that is potentially the contrary to the views of the sitting women justices,\\u201D Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion political group, told the New York Times last month. Even though, by 2020, we should know better than to assume that a single representative of a demographic will always best represent that demographic, Democrats would have to tread carefully were they to so much as insinuate that Barrett, a woman, might not ensure the best futures for most (nonwhite, non-Christian, not straight or cis, not financially comfortable) women, a majority of whom want to keep abortion legal. So too were Barrett defenders able to wield her motherhood status when it came to where she stands on racial justice. Earlier this week, when Sen. Cory Booker asked her if she condemns white supremacy \\u2014 noting that the president who appointed her has failed to do so in a straightforward way \\u2014 he was slammed on the conservative internet for what was apparently a deeply offensive question, given that, as the Blaze and many other conservative outlets pointed out, Barrett is the mother of two Black children. (She answered Booker in the affirmative.) Though the grown children of transracial adoption will readily tell you that being the adoptive parents of kids of color doesn\\u2019t magically make white people not racist (and can even help mask their racism), it\\u2019s automatically assumed of white, partnered, religious mothers \\u2014 in the way it isn\\u2019t for Black mothers, or single mothers, or poor mothers, many of whom tend to be vilified rather than lionized \\u2014 that they can do little wrong.To be clear, I don\\u2019t know anything about what kind of mother Barrett is, and in all likelihood she\\u2019s a good and loving parent. But she\\u2019s given the benefit of the doubt in the way that I can\\u2019t at all imagine a single Black mother of seven children would have. What\\u2019s more: It\\u2019s assumed that her particular brand of motherhood would actually make her a better justice. To deflect Democratic worries that Barrett\\u2019s confirmation could threaten the status of the Affordable Care Act, which has occupied a large chunk of the hearings, Sen. Charles Grassley suggested that \\u201Cas a mother of a seven, Judge Barrett clearly understands the importance of healthcare.\\u201D Meghan Daum, who\\u2019s written extensively about the stereotypes leveled against childless women, wrote in her column for GEN this week that both Barrett and vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who\\u2019s frequently emphasized her role as a stepmother and aunt, or \\u201CMomala,\\u201D on the campaign trail, are evidence of an \\u201Cassumption ... that female leaders can\\u2019t really be trusted unless they\\u2019re mothers. Or, at the very least, they can\\u2019t be trusted by campaign strategists to be relatable to the public at large.\\u201D \\u201CIt\\u2019s that tightrope that women have to walk that men don\\u2019t,\\u201D Christine Matthews, a Republican pollster who focuses on female voters, told the New York Times in a story this week about the \\u201Cfreighted expectations for women\\u201D holding public office. Men typically aren\\u2019t subjected, as Barrett and so many other working mothers have been, to questions about how they can possibly do it all. (Barrett has mentioned that her husband does \\u201Cmore than\\u201D his fair share of work at home, and that they have \\u201Cfriends and fearless babysitters\\u201D helping out. While we don\\u2019t know her specific arrangements, other families of means tend to employ other women, often women of color, to do a lot of the gruntwork of childrearing behind the scenes, and they\\u2019re typically overworked, underpaid, and subjected to a constant state of precarity.) Still, Matthews noted, Barrett seems well primed to walk that rope. \\u201CThe Republican members of the judiciary are introducing her as a legal titan who drives a minivan. They are in some ways daring Democrats to step all over a minivan mom.\\u201D Now that the hearings have ended, all signs point to the minivan mom emerging triumphant. The national outrage that swelled during the 2018 hearings is more or less absent now. To be fair, it\\u2019s 2020; everybody\\u2019s exhausted and pretty much confined to their homes. And we don\\u2019t have a figure like Christine Blasey Ford, whose testimony about the sexual assault she experienced as a teenager gave a sense of real, human gravity to Kavanaugh\\u2019s confirmation. During the Barrett hearings, Democrats have trotted out anecdotes and photos of constituents who are terrified that they\\u2019ll lose their healthcare \\u2014 the Supreme Court will be hearing a case about the Affordable Care Act a week after Election Day \\u2014 but the most powerful image to have emerged from this week has been that of Barrett herself, brandishing her empty notepad or else simply sitting there, withstanding hours of questioning, so very close to becoming the youngest justice on the bench. At 48, she has the power to shape American law for decades. While the mood of these hearings might be a lot more \\u201Ccivil\\u201D than 2018\\u2019s, the stakes couldn\\u2019t possibly be higher. If confirmed, Barrett will cement a 6\\u20133 conservative majority on the court, making it, according to one Washington Post analysis, the most conservative SCOTUS since 1950. Not to mention that Republicans have, in classic fashion, violated their own precedent against ramming an appointment through during an election year; meanwhile, millions of Americans are desperate for immediate relief during a catastrophic period in American history, and unlike Amy Coney Barrett, they\\u2019re just going to have to wait for whatever cruelly underbaked stimulus package manages to eke by in the Senate. Booker was among the more passionate Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee, making clear that he didn\\u2019t see all this as another business-as-usual hearing in which the Dems play by the rules that Republicans set and, when it suits them, are all too happy to break. During his opening statement, Booker condemned the \\u201Ccharade,\\u201D repeating that \\u201Cnone of this is normal and we cannot normalize it.\\u201D But sounding the alarms over what a great existential threat Amy Coney Barrett\\u2019s confirmation would be to healthcare, abortion rights, and LGBTQ rights (to name a few) isn\\u2019t easy when besmirching the purity and goodness of Christian white womanhood is treated as a grievous sin in this country \\u2014 far greater a sin, according to conservatives, at least, than leaving millions uninsured, or condemning pregnant people to illness or deepening poverty if they\\u2019re forced to give birth against their will, or denying trans children the right to lives free of harassment and violence. The supposed moral purity and goodness of white motherhood has consistently enabled conservatives who\\u2019ve combined large families with high-profile careers, like Sarah Palin and anti-ERA activist Phyllis Schlafly, to carry out the extraordinarily damaging work of white supremacist patriarchy in a prettier, more feminine package. Barrett, with her \\u201Cnear-perfect performance\\u201D at this week\\u2019s hearings, is only the latest in a long, long line of white women whose pleasant, down-home family values have successfully masked her ability \\u2014 and her will \\u2014 to do extraordinary damage to families that don\\u2019t look like hers. And it\\u2019s terrifying. ●"},{"author":"Laurence Berland","title":"Opinion: Miles Taylor's Actions At DHS Are Not Excused By His Support For Biden","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/laurenceberland\/miles-taylor-dhs-google","content":"On Nov. 6, 2019, I sent the last email I would ever send using my Google corporate account. My coworkers and I had been expressing concerns about the hiring of a former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff, Miles Taylor. According to \\u200Binternal DHS emails\\u200B obtained by BuzzFeed News, Taylor played direct roles in the defense of a version of the Muslim travel ban and child separation policies. His hiring raised serious concerns for us about workplace safety, especially for Muslim, Latinx, and immigrant workers who, along with many others, chose to express their worries and question leadership via the corporate network. In response, the company censored us by deleting emails, memes, and questions from the corporate network, ironically claiming in part that they caused a hostile workplace for Taylor. In my email, I explained that expressing these concerns about the workplace seemed to be protected by labor law; by deleting them, Google appeared to be violating those laws. Within 30 minutes, I was locked out of my account and put on administrative leave. A few weeks later, Google fired me and three other workplace organizers. Because we were fired without notice on the week of Thanksgiving, the press called us \\u201Cthe Thanksgiving Four.\\u201D So imagine my surprise to read Taylor\\u2019s Washington Post op-ed excoriating Donald Trump for, among other things, precisely the policies he worked to defend while at the DHS that caused so many at Google (and \\u200Bin Congress\\u200B) to object to his hiring. Taylor is now supporting Joe Biden for president and has even \\u200Btaken a leave of absence\\u200B from his policy role at Google to support the Biden campaign. Given that Taylor and I now strongly agree on one of the most important decisions Americans will face in the coming months, I was originally hesitant to comment publicly. Despite our many differences of opinion, I can respect Never Trump Republicans such as George Conway because they have consistently condemned the Trump administration for an almost unending list of failings. But I cannot help viewing with great cynicism the timing of Taylor\\u2019s jumping from a now-sinking ship on whose crew he enthusiastically served for more than two years. I see Taylor\\u2019s very public change of heart, and Google\\u2019s willingness to indulge it, less as an act of moral courage than as a simple attempt to distance himself from a role that suddenly seems likely to be more of a liability than an asset to his future prospects. Not only did Taylor decline to repudiate his former role when his new coworkers objected a year ago, he still does not do so now. Instead, he prefers to simply ignore his integral part in the very actions he now professes to find objectionable, as if he were a passive observer. In interviews, he has claimed not to have been at DHS when the family separation policy was developed. But his own emails prove that not only was he there prior to its enactment, he even helped prepare its roll out \\u2014 in an email to former DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in the days before the policy was announced, he sent her talking points with the Orwellian title, \\\"Protecting Children Narrative.\\\" I certainly agree that \\u200B\\u201Cfour more years of [Trump] are unthinkable.\\u201D\\u200B However, as former Trump officials seek to distance themselves from complicity in the administration\\u2019s many violations of morals, ethics, and decency, I note that Taylor and those like him admit no guilt, display no contrition, and offer no apologies. While he enjoys time off from a golden parachute position in a policy role at a tech behemoth to pen op-eds and film TV commercials, perhaps as much to rehabilitate his public image as anything, where is the sense of responsibility or regret? The impression left with the astute reader is that Taylor does not believe he did anything wrong. Taylor, once again, is looking for a soft landing. I am not ready to accept with open arms the many former administration officials who, over the next two months, will no doubt try to chart a similar path to a post-Trump career. If Taylor really believes that policies like Muslim bans and the caging of children are wrong, why doesn\\u2019t he apologize for working to perpetrate them, and why did he do that work in the first place? I do not know if any of the countless \\u200Bthousands\\u200B whose lives were destroyed by these policies could ever forgive Taylor for his part in their suffering; I cannot speak for them, and I can only hope that those who survived will one day be able to come forward and tell us exactly \\u200Bwhat they went through\\u200B and \\u200Bhow it affected them\\u200B. Compared to what Taylor did at the behest of Trump, the harm my coworkers and I have suffered by Taylor\\u2019s actions is comparatively small, but nonetheless he harmed us, too. Like he did in his role at DHS, Taylor is again crafting a \\u200Bnarrative\\u200B, one in which he is another of Trump\\u2019s victims, but he and others who played a part in the atrocities of the Trump administration cannot be absolved of their past simply by supporting Biden\\u2019s bid for the presidency. If they truly are asking for our forgiveness, they will first need to admit that what they did was wrong, and say those words that Trump himself surely never will: \\u201CI\\u2019m sorry.\\u201DLaurence Berland, a former Googler, now primarily devotes his time to community volunteering and labor organizing.

Then The Coronavirus Arrived.","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/rinacummings\/amazon-warehouse-was-grinding-me-down-then-coronavirus","content":"The journalists at BuzzFeed News are proud to bring you trustworthy and relevant reporting about the coronavirus. To help keep this news free, become a member and sign up for our newsletter, Outbreak Today.Even before the coronavirus hit, going to work at an Amazon warehouse already felt like I was risking my health. Standing on your feet for 12 hours at a time and performing repetitive motions while sorting boxes takes a toll on your body. By the middle of my shift, my joints throb with pain and sometimes my fingers become numb. I know my body is asking me to take a breather. But the clock doesn\\u2019t stop ticking, and I can\\u2019t make rate if I take a break. In the first few weeks after COVID-19 came to New York City, the warehouse operated as usual. People started getting sick, and we knew it, but Amazon wasn\\u2019t giving us any information. The company said it sent people who were confirmed to have had contact with the virus home with pay, but most people who were sick weren\\u2019t able to get tested. And we know many people who were sent home still haven\\u2019t received pay. We kept working, standing next to each other on the floor of the sorting department, in the break room, and on the crowded buses taking us to the warehouse. I have been out on medical leave for a few weeks, choosing not to go into work to protect myself and my family. Amazon let us have unlimited unpaid time off (UPT) last month, but that\\u2019s not an option anymore. We either have to go to work or quit, which would risk eligibility for unemployment. I worry about catching the coronavirus when I go back to work. The company has now staggered our shifts, so there are fewer people. But there\\u2019s no real social distancing in the warehouse. We get gloves and masks, but we have to keep wearing them over and over again because the supply is nowhere near enough. When I get home from work, I jump in the shower right away, even before hugging my kids, because I don't want to spread the virus. Amazon doesn\\u2019t pay me for the extra time it takes for me to sanitize everything that went to work with me, or the extra loads of laundry I am running to keep everything clean. I am a single mom with two beautiful children. Right now, my kids are home from school. When I can afford to, I\\u2019ll pay for a babysitter \\u2014 but mostly my 15-year-old takes care of my 2-year-old when I go to work. My shift is 12 hours, overnight Thursday through Sunday. From my coworkers I organize with, I\\u2019ve heard that things are busier than ever in the warehouse. Every day during COVID-19 feels like the week before Christmas. Amazon is making a killing from this crisis. Almost literally. Jeff Bezos\\u2019s net worth has grown by more than $24 billion since the crisis started since everyone is at home trying to avoid going to the store and ordering everything online. But none of that money is going to workers. I have more expenses now than before, buying masks, gloves, and cleaning supplies; doing more laundry; paying for childcare; and trying to do everything I can to keep life as normal and happy as possible for my kids. And I don't know what I\\u2019ll do if I get sick.When Amazon workers, including some of my coworkers, have spoken out about unsafe conditions and demanded the facility be shut down and sanitized after positive COVID-19 cases were identified, some have been fired in apparent retaliation. We just learned yesterday that an Amazon executive resigned over the unfair firing of whistleblowers who are trying to keep themselves and their workers safe. Amazon doesn\\u2019t need much of an excuse to fire us; it happens all the time. Anyone can be fired without any notice or reason \\u2014 being a few minutes late, getting written up for not making rate, demanding more gloves or masks. My elderly coworker was fired over voicemail for leaning on a stopped belt on a break. Management said he was sitting while he should have been working. I can\\u2019t afford to get fired, so I\\u2019m on my toes all the time to make sure that Amazon doesn\\u2019t have an excuse. I live just 20 minutes from the warehouse in Staten Island, and I usually take the bus to work. My commute should be easy, but it easily turns bad. The buses coming from the ferry often skip my stop because they are jam-packed with Amazon workers. When that has happened in the past, I take a $50 Uber to work to avoid being late and having an hour deducted from my UPT. There is a lot of fear from workers that Amazon will terminate you if you use too much UPT, which makes everyone stressed about getting to work on time. Time is everything at Amazon. I\\u2019ve developed digestive issues since I\\u2019ve been working there because I have to shove food down my throat and then run back to my station. A robot will write me up if I am late. It doesn\\u2019t care whether I had my lunch or not. It doesn\\u2019t care if I am coughing, or if I faint at my station, or if someone else sneezes on me. They just count the rate of how many packages I sort. I am a human. Not a machine. I learned that the New York City Council is considering legislation that would require big corporations like Amazon to pay extra during this crisis to compensate us for the increased risks we are taking on and make it harder for them to fire us on a whim. Going to work is a health hazard during this crisis, but we need the money, and people need to get the supplies we are sorting. A bit more pay and some job security would ease a lot of stress. They say we are essential, but Amazon treats us like we\\u2019re expendable.Rina Cummings works at the Amazon JFK8 warehouse on Staten Island and is a member of Make the Road New York.

To help keep this news free, become a member and sign up for our newsletter, Outbreak Today.The novel coronavirus pandemic is upending health care as a business, a profession, and a human relationship. As an infectious disease physician on the frontlines, I am bearing witness daily to hardships and tragedies befalling my patients, their families, health care providers, my work colleagues, and society as a whole. Ironically, it is some of my non-COVID-19 patients who are teaching me to maintain resilience and hope in the face of compounding adversity. With his permission, I would like to tell you about one of them. Mr. S had an extraordinary series of setbacks. He and his entire family contracted influenza at the end of January. Strike one. Soon after, he developed a severe strep throat. Strike two. Then, the strep bacteria causing his sore throat ended up invading his bloodstream and circulated throughout his body. A devastating strike three. Strikes 4\\u201316 (and still rising) were a cascade of complications resulting from system-wide toxin production from the circulating strep. They included: I began caring for Mr. S. in January, before our state confirmed any cases of the novel coronavirus, and when there were only a few cases reported nationally. I knew that in situations like his, mortality rates exceed 80%. I knew that if he survived, he would remain in the hospital for months and that his life would never be the same. As the onslaught of COVID-19 unfolded in our world and in our region, he remained my unresponsive, paralyzed, intubated patient \\u2014 a husband, a father, a professional, silently struggling for his life. His ICU bay was decorated with photos of his family, his dog, drawings from his children. His relatives would visit, hold his limp bandaged hands, cry, and pray. In early March, our hospital began restricting all visits from friends and family to minimize exposure to the novel coronavirus. Overnight, Mr. S. instantly went from being in the shadows to being alone. Mr. S remained largely in solitude as the COVID-19 pandemic worsened. His family and friends, unable to be with him physically, would join him over FaceTime for a few brief moments each day, cheering on their husband and dad, their silent hero. Last week I stopped by to evaluate Mr. S in the ICU, joined via teleconference by a group of enthusiastic students who were shadowing me during \\u201CVirtual Rounds.\\u201D As I walked in, I was shocked. Mr. S was awake and alert. He made eye contact with me, and smiled. I approached him and grasped his hand in disbelief. \\u201CMr. S?\\u201D \\u201CYes,\\u201D he silently mouthed, his voice absent as a result of his tracheostomy. \\u201CDo you know who I am?\\u201D \\u201CNo,\\u201D he replied, still smiling. \\u201CI\\u2019ve helped take care of you for the past two months. This is the first time you and I have actually spoken.\\u201D \\u201CThank you,\\u201D he mouthed, smiling and nodding. It is hard to encapsulate in words what went through me in that moment. Here was a person who had defied the odds of survival and endured unspeakable challenges. I am certain he understood that his life, his body, his existence would never be the same. He had spent the last three months sedated, without sentience or full awareness, as a monumental global emergency unfolded. As many of his ICU neighbors, COVID-19 and non-COVID-19, came and went, he remained. When he finally awoke, he was connected to machines, likely confused, scared, unable to speak, and without family present or able to visit. I could not imagine a more poignant definition of alone. Yet Mr. S was bright-eyed, talkative despite lacking a voice, and in good spirits. He said hello to my team of students over video, and he turned his bandaged hands so they could see their first example of extensive gangrene. He understood that he had straddled the fine line between life and death, and that his case would be momentous in the education and career decisions of these future clinicians. As my students began to thank him, he interrupted them and thanked them instead. Intensive care for a single critically ill patient requires a Herculean 24\\\/7 effort by nurses, intensivists, respiratory therapists, phlebotomists, pharmacists, anesthesiologists, specialists, residents, fellows, staff, and facility workers. While the COVID-19 pandemic has brought this effort and the patient experience to the forefront, and rightfully so, we would be remiss as a society to forget the other critically ill patients who remain vulnerable, struggling in silence. They are more alone now than ever before. While I continue to see critically-ill patients, I always stop by and see Mr. S. At this point, he does more for my spirit than I do for him.Dr. Sudeb Dalai is an infectious disease physician, Stanford professor, medical director at Karius, and the creator of IDMonitor.org.

I Know Where To Find Them.","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/petervincent\/opinion-contact-tracting-testing-reopening-work-jobs","content":"The journalists at BuzzFeed News are proud to bring you trustworthy and relevant reporting about the coronavirus. To help keep this news free, become a member and sign up for our newsletter, Outbreak Today.As we debate reopening the country in the midst of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, it is clear that one crucial ingredient will be a massive mobilization of people to make the process work. The public health, community outreach, and large-scale testing and contact tracing programs that experts agree we need will require huge numbers of boots on the ground. So will supporting seniors and the medically vulnerable, who will likely face a much lengthier quarantine. Where will we find such an army of dedicated and well-trained people? The good news is part of it has already been trained and assembled. American taxpayers have already made the significant investment required to recruit, select, prepare, and medically screen a relief corps of thousands of volunteers to be deployed across the world on missions involving everything from public health and food banks to homeless shelters and medical logistics. The bad news is last month the Trump administration fired all of them. There were about 7,300 Peace Corps volunteers serving in over 60 developing countries when the organization\\u2019s global operations were suspended. A program that has extended a helping American hand to the world since President John F. Kennedy established it in 1961 was suddenly and unceremoniously withdrawn, at exactly the moment when American leadership, sacrifice, and assistance to the most vulnerable nations in the world would have been especially welcome. But if there\\u2019s an upside, it\\u2019s this: The Trump administration now has a golden opportunity to remobilize the Peace Corps and harness its unique energy and willingness to serve, right here in the United States. The thousands of Peace Corps volunteers evacuated from across the globe represent America\\u2019s best and brightest, and they\\u2019re ready to serve this country right now. These patriotic Americans answered President Kennedy\\u2019s clarion call of \\u201Cask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country\\u201D by volunteering to live and work for subsistence wages in some of the poorest regions in the world. All Peace Corps volunteers are accustomed to living in challenging, sometimes harsh and dangerous, environments. As a result, they are highly adaptable, resilient, and gritty. They embody America\\u2019s can-do attitude. They are not easily intimidated or daunted by real-world crises. America could really use them right now, couldn\\u2019t we? As a returned Peace Corps volunteer who went on to serve in the Obama administration, my disappointment and frustration with the way the program was halted are both personal and professional. To begin with, there\\u2019s a legitimate question as to the wisdom of issuing an evacuation order and returning all volunteers en masse from overseas posts to a country \\u2014 the United States \\u2014 that was woefully unprepared to ensure a safe, healthy, and orderly return. But it goes beyond that. This action represents a hasty and panicked retreat from those achingly impoverished countries that so desperately need our assistance in this particular moment. The spirit embodying the Peace Corps ethos demands that our volunteers be sent to and to remain in overseas communities during good times and bad. We have failed both the overseas communities and the volunteers serving them. But now that the decision has been made, apparently with little serious thought about the long-term ramifications and damage to our global reputation, we must do what we can to convert this tragedy into hope for the welfare and the future of our communities here at home. The times demand imaginative approaches to mitigating the suffering and fear. Rather than firing highly educated, well-trained, enthusiastic Americans and thrusting them into the growing ranks of the unemployed, we should offer them the opportunity to continue with their public service commitment. They should now be surged to assist with caring for the most vulnerable and those hardest hit here at home. They can also complement the high-tech coronavirus tracking tools being built by Apple and Google with the old-fashioned, but highly effective testing and contact tracing methods that have worked in public health crises for generations. This will require the deployment of an army of thousands of trained contact tracers to interview everyone diagnosed with COVID-19 and to locate people they came into contact with during the period they may have been infectious. And that\\u2019s just the beginning of the challenge. Of course, unlike AmeriCorps VISTA volunteers who committed themselves to address domestic challenges, this type of national surge is not what Peace Corps volunteers signed up for. Most Peace Corps volunteers are inspired to serve their country by a combination of wanting to serve the public interest and the opportunity to do so whilst living and working overseas, learning a foreign language, and experiencing a different culture. Not all returning volunteers would agree to continue their work in this country, but most would, especially given the rates of unemployment we expect to see in the coming months. There are so many creative ways we could enlist this army of dedicated public servants to assist in alleviating the suffering that will leave our communities \\u2014 urban and rural alike \\u2014 struggling for months or years to come.

New York City Won't Accept It.","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/billdeblasio\/opinion-coronavirus-inequality-de-blasio-new-york","content":"The journalists at BuzzFeed News are proud to bring you trustworthy and relevant reporting about the coronavirus.

The headline wrote itself, as heads of state, celebrities, famous athletes, and literal royalty tested positive for the virus. No one was immune. It was an easy story. But it was woefully incomplete. Look beyond the surface and you\\u2019ll see a deeper, more painful reality. It\\u2019s a story as old as this nation \\u2014 one that we should all recognize, if we\\u2019ve been paying attention. It\\u2019s the story of haves and have-nots. It\\u2019s the story of a broken economic and health care system that works for those at the top, and leaves others to die. It\\u2019s the story of black and brown Americans continuing to pay the price. Coronavirus has turned our nation\\u2019s inequalities into a body count. In New York City, we won\\u2019t accept that reality. Just like other cities, we\\u2019ve seen this virus ravage our communities of color and immigrant communities. It\\u2019s not hard to see why. They work on our front lines \\u2014 our nurses, our bus and taxi drivers, our supermarket and pharmacy workers. They\\u2019re more likely to live in multi-generational homes \\u2014 where \\u201Csocial distancing\\u201D is even harder. And too many have spent a lifetime without access to the medical care they deserve. The deck has been stacked against them since the beginning. As the mayor and first lady of New York City, we got into politics to end inequalities, wherever we found them. With New Yorkers\\u2019 help, we\\u2019ve pulled at the arc of justice for six years: Bringing Pre-K to every student in our city; giving every New Yorker access to health care; and bringing mental health care to all through our groundbreaking ThriveNYC program. But this is a new challenge. And it demands a new response to help our communities of color \\u2014 a four-part plan cities all over the world can learn from. Step 1: Keep protecting our public hospitals. These hospitals are the first line of defense for so many of our communities of color. When we came in six years ago, they were left for dead \\u2014 underfunded and understaffed, with threats of closures and layoffs of doctors, nurses, and staff. We invested billions to save our hospitals, and bring world-class care to the communities of color who largely depended on them. Right now, those hospitals are being stretched like never before. Every day, we\\u2019re getting them more help \\u2014 whether it\\u2019s face shields to protect our heroes, nurses we\\u2019ve recruited from the US military, or sending our own ventilators, made right here in New York City. We\\u2019re also using our public hospitals to bring testing right to our hard-hit communities. So far, we\\u2019ve opened five testing sites directly in the neighborhoods that need them most. We have five more on the way next week, and we\\u2019ll begin testing more than 7,000 people per week. We will remain laser-focused on helping people through our public hospitals, and all cities should. Step 2: Launch a massive public awareness campaign. There\\u2019s a pesky word in front of this virus: \\u201CNovel.\\u201D The best scientists in the world are still learning more by the hour. It\\u2019s our job to get new information out to every community \\u2014 no matter the language or communication barrier. So we\\u2019ve invested more than $10 million in a targeted ad campaign to our hardest-hit communities. We\\u2019ve translated the messages across 14 languages, and blanketed every digital and print channel we can to make sure we reach everyone. Step 3: Do deep grassroots outreach. Media alone won\\u2019t be enough. We need to go into these communities and reach people. How do you go into a community when everyone\\u2019s stuck inside? We\\u2019re starting with a texting campaign \\u2014 real health care workers starting a dialogue. But there\\u2019s no substitute for human-to-human interaction. If we can get enough protective equipment, we\\u2019ll send health care workers into these communities and reach people in person. Step 4: Expand our Phone-a-Clinician program. Even with grassroots outreach, these communities deserve more. They deserve a resource to turn to with any questions they might have, day or night. \\u201CHow can I keep safe?\\u201D \\u201CShould my kids be going outside?\\u201D We owe not only answers, but security. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re expanding our Phone-a-Clinician program. Our communities of color and immigrant communities will have direct access to a clinician around-the-clock. They can ask anything they want, for free, and get the right advice to keep themselves and their families safe. Those four steps will make a big difference \\u2014 and they\\u2019ll help our communities of color get through this crisis. But \\u201Cgetting through\\u201D this isn\\u2019t enough. Someday, this crisis will end \\u2014 in New York City and across the world. When it does, it\\u2019s on us to build something even better. It\\u2019s on us to continue the mission we\\u2019ve devoted ourselves to for six years \\u2014 to keep tearing down every wall of inequality, and bringing opportunity and fairness to every single New Yorker. That\\u2019s the only way forward. And it\\u2019s exactly what we\\u2019ll do.Bill de Blasio is the mayor of New York City.

To help keep this news free, become a member and sign up for our newsletter, Outbreak Today.There has been a debate raging for decades about what the economy actually is, where economic growth comes from, and how to measure economic success. It took a public health crisis, a botched response, and a misplaced and dangerous proclamation by potentially the least economically informed president in US history, but that debate is now finally settled. Before I explain how President Donald Trump inadvertently highlighted how progressives have been right about the economy all along, here is where the debate stood as of a few weeks ago: On the one side were conservatives who argued that the most important aspects of the economy were corporations and wealthy \\u201Cjob creators\\u201D who, they claim, drive economic growth. According to them, all you needed to do to measure economic success was look at stock prices and corporate profits, and as long as they are high and rising, the economy is strong and growing. These conservatives have spent decades pushing the idea that the best thing to do for the economy was for the government to get out of the way and allow the \\u201Cinvisible hand\\u201D of an unfettered marketplace to guide the economy. Not only would this allow corporations and the wealthy to create jobs and invest their gains, but, we were told, societal ills such as racial discrimination and gender disparities would eventually disappear, competed away by profit-seeking firms. That view has driven policymaking for decades and shaped much of the economic discourse among business leaders and the media. On the other side of the debate were progressives who have been saying for years that this dominant view of the economy has it absolutely backward. The most important aspect of the economy, we say, are the workers and consumers. And the best way to measure economic health and success is to look at how they, the people who make up the economy, are actually doing. Not the people at the top, not the corporations, not the stock market, but actual people. And not just some slice of them \\u2014 all of them. When everyday workers, families, and communities are thriving, the economy will thrive along with them. Conversely, if economic policies are focused on juicing the stock market or putting money into the hands of those so-called job creators \\u2014 while allowing communities to be excluded, exploited, forgotten, or scapegoated \\u2014 the economy will stagnate and underperform, will fail to deliver real prosperity, and will be inherently unstable and insecure. Trump effectively conceded the debate to progressives in a recent appearance on Fox News. He went on television and announced he wanted to get the country and the economy \\u201Copened up\\u201D and \\u201Craring to go\\u201D by Easter. This would have been an absolute catastrophe for public health and the economy because the only way for the economy to heal is by first stopping the spread of the virus. Luckily, he eventually reversed himself. But Trump\\u2019s wrongheaded desire to \\u201Crestart\\u201D the economy revealed what \\u201Cthe economy\\u201D really is. When the president talked about opening up the economy, he didn\\u2019t mean he wanted to open up the stock market \\u2014 that was still open. He didn\\u2019t mean he wanted to \\u201Copen up\\u201D corporate profits either. And he didn\\u2019t even mean he wanted all those wealthy \\u201Cjob creators\\u201D to go out and create jobs \\u2014 they couldn\\u2019t, even if they wanted to. What he meant was crystal clear and very telling. He meant that he wanted workers who were confined to their homes to go back to their workplaces. He wanted the factories that had been shut down because they didn\\u2019t have anyone to run the machines to be able to open again. He wanted people back out in the streets, in stores, hotels, and resorts \\u2014 spending the money they had earned, creating a virtuous cycle of demand that drives robust economic growth. This was even clear when he reversed his position and told people that social distancing would have to continue for longer. He realized that sickening or killing millions of workers would be even worse for the economy than keeping them home. Nothing about the coronavirus pandemic makes this basic fact more true now than it has always been. The source of economic growth is, in a very practical and direct sense, the workers who create, produce, and deliver the goods and services that we all depend on and enjoy. The more we fully include people in the economy \\u2014 removing barriers like systemic racism and structural misogyny \\u2014 the better off we will all be. Getting out of the way of rich people doesn\\u2019t create growth; it just creates opportunities for those rich people to use their power and position to hoard the benefits that come from growth. There is a whole lot we need to do to pull our country out of this public health and economic calamity. But if there is one shared understanding I hope we can emerge from this crisis with, it\\u2019s this: We are the economy. It\\u2019s a simple phrase, but it says a lot. The economy is not the stock market, or the bottom lines of a handful of massive corporations. The economy is the nurses, grocery store workers, warehouse and construction workers, and so many other workers and families. And when they aren\\u2019t prospering, the economy isn\\u2019t strong. We are the economy, and we can join together \\u2014 whether we are white, black, or brown, whether we were born here or we came here \\u2014 to take back power from the wealthy and well connected and use it to invest in ourselves, unrig the rules, and include us all in the growth and prosperity that will follow. This is true in a pandemic, as Trump not-so-eloquently highlighted.

Loans and grants for businesses large and small will take time to make it to the workers they\\u2019re meant to be supporting; even the $1,200 payments for most people won\\u2019t hit bank accounts for a couple of weeks \\u2014 a couple of months in some cases \\u2014 and won\\u2019t help workers who are undocumented. But there\\u2019s a system that already puts food on the table, in the most literal sense of the term, for millions of people in the country who are most in need. Ramping it up to meet the scale of today\\u2019s needs could be fast, simple, and extremely effective. It\\u2019s time to supersize SNAP. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, otherwise known as food stamps, helped feed about 40 million people in households with low incomes last year \\u2014 the people most vulnerable to the economic chaos that is currently unfolding. They get a payment card that is reloaded monthly and which can be used to buy food at supermarkets and groceries \\u2014 it turns out to be worth about $1.40 per meal per person. SNAP benefits should be one of the fastest ways to get relief to people who need it right now. But there\\u2019s a catch, or more accurately, many catches: To qualify for SNAP, able-bodied adults without dependents must work a total of 80 hours a month, or roughly 20 hours a week. If a person is laid off, or, say, suddenly doesn\\u2019t have a job due to a pandemic, they\\u2019re given three months of benefits in any 36-month period. Once those three months are used, they must wait out the three-year period before they\\u2019re able to again receive help when they need it most again. Your household must also pass strict asset tests; if you have more than a few thousand dollars' worth, you\\u2019re out of luck. And not everything in the supermarket can be bought with a SNAP card, including many daily household essentials. But now is not the time for work requirements, limits, and \\u201CSNAP-approved\\u201D foods. Work requirements must be lifted; limitations on assets must be drastically raised. Ready-to-eat foods, toilet paper, diapers, and cleaning products should be included in items that can be purchased with SNAP dollars. The fastest way to give support to our most vulnerable populations is to give them money to spend at their neighborhood grocery stores. People who are now facing an inability to work due to lack of childcare, illness, or places of employment suddenly closing their doors could face losing their benefits for several months if they have already used their three-month allotment. As someone who once lived in a studio apartment with my then-4-year-old daughter, relying heavily on each and every quarter to make ends meet, I learned from personal experience that government assistance programs are quick to kick people off their lists. A handwritten pay stub brought a threatening call from my caseworker who wanted to cancel my childcare grant immediately if I couldn\\u2019t prove my income was real. A $50 pay raise meant less than $200 a month for food, plus a $50 co-pay at daycare. Falling below 20 hours a week as a full-time college student with a child over 6 meant I was kicked off food stamps entirely. When things like this happened, it felt like the floor was dropping out from underneath me. It was a crushing sense of hopelessness, one that so many Americans have lived through and are living right now. \\u201CAs someone who grew up with a single parent, living paycheck to paycheck, I can feel the anxiety and stress taking hold of families across the country right now,\\u201D Saeed Jones tweeted recently. I cannot even imagine the decisions that single parents with elementary-aged kids are facing today with school closures \\u2014 especially if they depend on free breakfast and lunch programs to feed their child like I once did. President Barack Obama recently tweeted praise for NBA players who are donating their wages to help supplement the lost income of workers in their stadiums. \\u201CA reminder that we\\u2019re a community,\\u201D he said, \\u201Cand that each of us has an obligation to look out for each other.\\u201D More companies are offering paid sick leave, including Starbucks and McDonald\\u2019s, while others are expanding on policies they already had in place. These are all good gestures, but at a time like this, only the government can truly look out for everyone; no amount of individual generosity or corporate tinkering can put a dent in the worst economic moment since the Great Depression. The jobs that keep our working class afloat are gone, and it\\u2019s going to take the government\\u2019s help to keep workers from going under completely. Millions of people are now wondering how they\\u2019ll feed their children in the coming months \\u2014 and there\\u2019s a program that can be fixed, right now, that will ease their pain.Stephanie Land is the author of Maid: Hard Work, Low Pay, and a Mother's Will to Survive and a fellow at Community Change."},{"author":"Scott Wiener","title":"Coronavirus And HIV Are Different Pandemics, But The Lessons Are The Same","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/scottwiener\/coronavirus-and-hiv-aids-lessons-san-francisco","content":"For many of us who\\u2019ve been on the front lines of the HIV pandemic for decades, the emergence and explosion of the novel coronavirus has been scary in a very particular kind of way. As a gay man who started having sex as a 17-year-old in 1987 \\u2014 when huge numbers were dying of AIDS and there was no effective treatment \\u2014 and who began my HIV advocacy in 1990 as an AIDS hotline volunteer in North Carolina, the spread of the coronavirus brought back dark memories. We\\u2019ve been through this before with a virus that killed millions and made so many sick, right? Yes and no. HIV and the novel coronavirus are both highly destructive, with massive and tragic human consequences. But they\\u2019re obviously also quite different in the way they spread, the options for treatment and recovery, and the way they kill. But despite their differences, each virus reminds us of some strikingly similar truths. First among them: The government\\u2019s early response to a pandemic \\u2014 or its lack of response \\u2014 helps determine the pandemic\\u2019s trajectory. As HIV appeared in the early 1980s, the federal government was MIA. Because the virus only appeared to impact gay men and intravenous drug users, the federal response was borderline non-existent. President Ronald Reagan didn\\u2019t even say the words \\u201CHIV\\u201D or \\u201CAIDS\\u201D until the late 1980s, after the virus had spread out of control. Had the federal government decisively intervened with widespread public health strategies and improved care, lives would have been saved. We would have had a fighting chance to stop HIV from becoming a worldwide pandemic that, to date, has infected 75 million people and killed 32 million. While the national response to the coronavirus in the United States has been far from ideal \\u2014 particularly the lack of testing and President Donald Trump\\u2019s ignorant statements denying the pandemic \\u2014 we\\u2019ve seen aggressive steps in a number of states to enforce social distancing, and actions to quickly invest huge resources in creating treatments and a vaccine. Unlike the slow response to HIV, it didn\\u2019t take years and years for our federal government to take the pandemic seriouslyWe\\u2019ve also learned that governments are much more likely to respond aggressively to a pandemic that infects \\u201Cmainstream\\u201D society and not just marginalized groups. So, why the fast \\u2014 albeit not fast enough \\u2014 government response to the coronavirus instead of the slow and destructive response to HIV? That\\u2019s a simple one: COVID-19 threatens everyone, including rich people, white people, powerful people, and straight people. HIV overwhelmingly has impacted gay and bisexual men, trans people, low-income people of color, people who inject drugs, and people from impoverished countries. Indeed, it wasn\\u2019t until Ryan White, a child who became HIV-positive after a blood transfusion, heroically publicized his infection, that Congress stepped up with serious funding for the pandemic. When pandemics overwhelmingly impact marginalized communities, they get ignored. And that can mean 32 million people dying. When problems impact the rich and the powerful, we spring into action, even if it means shutting down much of the economy and spending more than a trillion dollars in federal funds. The same wasn\\u2019t true for people living with HIV. So many died quiet deaths, with little or no government or medical support. Yet, despite all of this, there are also wonderful things to learn from the way our communities have responded to pandemics, whether HIV or the coronavirus. In each case, we\\u2019ve seen the absolute best that people have to offer. People become more pro-science. This was true when the HIV pandemic was at its peak. And it should be true today. In an era when vaccine-denialism is on the rise, when public health infrastructure has been gutted, and when our federal government has essentially abandoned serious efforts to plan for pandemics, we\\u2019re at serious risk. The coronavirus with all the pain it is causing, is helping build support for improved public health infrastructure. We\\u2019re already seeing a broad community response. People are checking in on their elderly neighbors. People are collecting masks and other protective equipment, given the shortage. Businesses are voluntarily manufacturing masks and ventilators. We\\u2019re seeing major organizing to help our most vulnerable community members. And, of course, the heroes in our health care system \\u2014 nurses, physicians, other health care workers, nursing home workers \\u2014 are putting themselves at significant risk, often without proper protective gear, out of a sense of duty. Similarly, our grocery and pharmacy workers, as well as delivery drivers, are putting themselves at risk to ensure that people have access to food and medicine. The HIV pandemic saw a similarly inspiring community response. As the federal government ignored the pandemic through much of the 1980s, some cities sprung into action. San Francisco devoted untold resources to fight the virus. Our city built a massive public health infrastructure to prevent infections and improve care. San Francisco has the best Department of Public Health in the nation \\u2014 perhaps the world \\u2014 and part of the reason is our incredible response to the HIV pandemic. \\u201CMy hyper-vigilance is built in, particularly having been trained during the HIV crisis,\\u201D Dr. Grant Colfax, San Francisco\\u2019s current director of public health, told the San Francisco Chronicle. \\u201CThe early action is required, and many places retroactively are asking why they didn\\u2019t take aggressive action earlier.\\u201D Similarly, San Francisco built a highly effective network of community-based organizations to combat HIV. These nonprofits formed a powerful safety net to take care of our neighbors. For decades, these nonprofits have played an essential role in San Francisco\\u2019s successful effort to collapse new infections (which it has done, by more than 95%), to connect people living with HIV to care (our city has one of the most virally suppressed HIV-positive populations in the world), and to enact cutting edge, progressive, forward-looking public health strategies that are models worldwide. Pandemics can bring out the best and the worst in humanity. They show the fault lines and inequities, while also showcasing community resilience. Let\\u2019s get through this pandemic together and then build a better future.Scott Wiener represents San Francisco and northern San Mateo County in the California State Senate.

Kathleen Blanco. He told her that the federal government had 500 buses on standby, which could help rescue the 100,000 people trapped in the city. \\u201CI promise you we will get you those buses,\\u201D Brown told her. There were no buses. Days passed, and tens of thousands of refugees gathered at the Superdome and New Orleans Convention Center. Little food, water, or medical supplies were available. No buses appeared. Nor did airdrops of supplies. As this paralysis and the resulting suffering became glaringly obvious, outrage and hand wringing grew about then-president George W. Bush\\u2019s disengagement, and the horrific spectacle of a global superpower unable to rescue its own citizens. The evacuation did not begin in earnest until Sept. 2, after National Guard troops arrived. Today, as an overwhelmed Trump administration \\u2014 and a president clearly out of his depth \\u2013 struggle to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, the government faces a \\u201Cmissing buses\\u201D scenario on a vastly greater scale. Healthcare workers lack masks, other protective equipment, and, most crucially, ventilators needed to handle rapidly expanding numbers of critical cases. Shortages of test kits persist and hospitals are rapidly becoming overwhelmed. Yet, even as appeals from governors, mayors and other officials have grown louder, President Donald Trump and the government he leads have failed to take the lead in ways that eerily parallel the presidential-level failures of Katrina. As the death toll increases, the bumbling response in the early weeks of the crisis will look worse and worse. But it\\u2019s not too late to learn from what happened almost 15 years ago in New Orleans. First of all, think about those missing buses. \\u201CYou know, we\\u2019re not a shipping clerk,\\u201D Trump said last week, criticizing appeals from governors for crucial medical supplies. In some sense, though, that\\u2019s exactly what the federal government needs to be right now. Logistics, carried out on a national level and led by the White House, are key to mobilizing public and private resources to avert mass death and suffering. Procuring buses in a national emergency was the job of two federal agencies. FEMA was supposed to make requests to the Department of Transportation. At the last minute before Hurricane Katrina hit, a FEMA official did make an inquiry, but DOT counterparts did not follow through and request buses from their contractor. An overwhelmed FEMA never followed up \\u2013 even as hungry, thirsty displaced residents waited for help. The request got lost in a paralyzed bureaucracy. Brown took a lot of blame for the whole botched response, and Bush\\u2019s \\u201CBrownie, you\\u2019re doing a heckuva job\\u201D became a catchphrase for incompetence. But the real fault lies with the Bush White House, which had marginalized FEMA and degraded its capacities. Under Bush\\u2019s predecessor Bill Clinton, FEMA had been given the clout to respond effectively to disasters, really for the first time since its creation under Jimmy Carter. But Bush downsized the agency and turned its leadership into a patronage post. Post-9\\\/11, it was folded into the newly created Department of Homeland Security, where its core mission \\u2014 mobilizing diverse government departments with White House backing \\u2014 became unworkable in a big crisis. (At the time, possible terror attacks were the government\\u2019s obsession, not hurricanes. And, ironically, on Aug. 30, then\\u2013DHS secretary Michael Chertoff blew off New Orleans to attend a CDC briefing on the threat of avian flu.) As a result, when the time came it was impossible to expedite urgent, lifesaving requests. The failures in both Katrina and the coronavirus pandemic point back to the specific decisions and character of each leader \\u2014 and their party\\u2019s hostility to government. Bush\\u2019s FEMA decisions were based half on the general principle of undoing things Clinton had done, half out of a Republican idea that the federal government should cede the lead on disasters to the states. Katrina showed that was nonsense: states can easily get overwhelmed; the federal government must be prepared to step in. This points to another principle of national disaster response, the most important one right now: When catastrophe hits, only presidential leadership can fully mobilize national resources as events unfold. The White House is the one American institution that commands resources and clout on a national scale, across state and international lines, and in both the public and private sectors. Put simply, a call from FEMA, or the CDC Director, or from a governor or mayor, won\\u2019t work like a call from the White House. Bush could have gotten those buses running in short order had anyone put him on the case. This means the White House must be organized, on a war footing. What\\u2019s needed is nothing less than a massive, national logistics operation to ramp up manufacture and distribution of key supplies now and over the coming months. There must be established lines of authority across agencies, and clear goals. Without them, breakdowns are inevitable and lives will be lost. Even with them, things will go wrong, and the president \\u2014 or those close to him in the chain of command \\u2013 must know whom to call, when, and exactly what to ask for to solve problems as they arise. Nothing like that is happening now. The White House\\u2019s considerable powers are simply going unused. As with the Bush White House, you have fast-moving events, weak organizations, and a basic inability to coordinate action. Add to that the lack of recognition that this is a problem \\u2014 the result of Trump\\u2019s personal ineptitude, transactionalism, and maliciousness. Trump\\u2019s crisis management style is essentially improvisation based on personal whims, not a response to concrete problems. This has made it impossible for the White House to centralize control and coordinate an effective response. Instead, governors are on a mad scramble to procure whatever they can from wherever they can. In New York, the national epicenter of the outbreak, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has been begging Trump to send ventilators. As of Tuesday, it had received a tiny fraction of the need: \\u201C400 ventilators? I need 30,000 ventilators. You want a pat on the back for 400 ventilators?\\u201D Cuomo said. Later, Vice President Mike Pence announced 4,000 more were on the way. Obviously, the federal government has the power \\u2014 through the Defense Production Act, among other things \\u2014 to compel the rapid manufacture and distribution of ventilators. But that\\u2019s not Pence\\u2019s job. Asked about governors\\u2019 requests, Trump said: \\u201CIt\\u2019s a two-way street. They have to treat us well, also. They can\\u2019t say, \\u2018Oh, gee, we should get this, we should get that.\\u2019\\u201D But that\\u2019s exactly what they should be saying, and the White House should jump in response. The worst of the Katrina humanitarian disaster played out over a week. The worst of COVID-19 is yet to come, and the void at the top remains one of our greatest weaknesses.John McQuaid is a Pulitzer Prize\\u2013winning science journalist and the co-author of Path of Destruction: The Devastation of New Orleans and the Coming Age of Superstorms."},{"author":"Tricia Wang","title":"Coronavirus: We Can Lean Something From The People Of Wuhan","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/triciawang\/a-lesson-from-the-people-of-wuhan-community-hyper-local","content":"The journalists at BuzzFeed News are proud to bring you trustworthy and relevant reporting about the coronavirus. To help keep this news free, become a member and sign up for our newsletter, Outbreak Today.Years ago, I walked the bustling streets of Wuhan as a Chinese American doing fieldwork on technology use among vulnerable populations. Back in January, when I started seeing footage of those streets silent and empty due to a city-wide quarantine to slow down the coronavirus outbreak, I went back into ethnographer mode. I worked with two of my former researchers, Shayla Qiu and Reginald Zhu, in Wuhan, to conduct virtual fieldwork to understand how people on the ground were responding to this crisis. Through a series of interviews over WeChat, I discovered a very different story about Wuhan than what I was reading in Western media. While news reports here focused on the authoritarian, top-down measures the Chinese government used to slow the rate of infection \\u2014 including the suppression of information and rapid construction of temporary hospitals \\u2014 the story I found was one of totally invisible, yet highly sophisticated networks of localized cooperation. It wasn\\u2019t just top-down measures that successfully slowed the infections in Wuhan, it was also bottom-up, dynamic organizing in emergent, hyperlocal groups. Neighbors were using social media to find food and medicine, support the sick, and help each other survive. And as coronavirus spreads across the United States and the world, we need to follow suit. We need to connect with people who live near us, centralize communication, and pool resources so we can care for one another. In a crisis where our own government\\u2019s response has felt uneven and at times misleading, we must learn from Wuhan and create our own hyperlocal support groups to come out stronger together. When Wuhan residents recognized that quarantine would be lengthy and government resources would be stretched, they turned to each other for help. They utilized an existing social construct, the xiao qu (小区) group, which literally translates to \\u201Csmall district.\\u201D A xiao qu is an official designation from the city grouping together all the homes in a given area. Typically, a xiao qu captain (a volunteer or someone appointed by the property management) invites all residents into one WeChat group, which can range from 50 to 500 people in size. Wuhan has at least 7,106 xiao qu groups among its 11.08 million residents, many of which existed before the coronavirus took hold. Once quarantines started, people realized that they could use the xiao qu to communicate with their socially distanced neighbors. And the hyperlocal network was born. They shared information. Whenever a news report circulated on WeChat, the group would examine and vet it together, pointing to better, verified sources. When rumors about potential cures were shared, people would warn each other from trying them. They shared uplifting quotes, memes, home exercise regimes, and recipes, but also asked their neighbors to go out and buy food or pick up medicine for them, a way of limiting group exposure. When an elderly woman without a smartphone told her neighbor that she had run out of food, the neighbor posted to the xiao qu group and her people donated portions of their groceries. When people fell ill, members fanned out into other WeChat groups to help find hospital beds and get information on caring for someone with the virus.Eventually xiao qu groups and businesses worked together to coordinate group purchasing. When it wasn\\u2019t feasible for grocery stores to make deliveries to individuals, members of the xiao qus pooled their orders for a single transaction with supermarkets. Sign-up sheets were made for bulk ordering of eggs, milk, and cleaning supplies. Soon the practice spread to bakeries, restaurants, and, most importantly, pharmacies. The xiao qu groups made people feel less lonely and more connected during a time of extended isolation. So while we may not have an exact cousin of the xiao qu outside of China, we can still create similar groups to help us weather the coronavirus storm. When New York City began instituting social distancing and staying at home, I set up my own neighborhood xiao qu. I borrowed what I\\u2019d learned from my researchers in Wuhan, and connected nearby friends and neighbors within walking distance on WhatsApp where we vetted information, shared updates on local store inventory, and checked in on those who felt ill. I\\u2019ve incorporated practices that work well in the online communities I use for work, including asking participants to agree to a code of conduct, maintaining a directory of all participants, and organizing the most frequently asked questions into a shared Google Doc. Our group includes families, people who live alone, and people with immunocompromised systems. We have discussed topics ranging from which local stores have hand sanitizers to interesting activities to do with one\\u2019s kids. We have solved problems such as how to determine if a mask manufacturer is credible or not, how to safely send laundry to the laundromat, and which local organizations need help. People have asked the group what they should do if they feel sick. When levity is needed, members have organized virtual dance parties like tfw.nyc or told others which webcams show the cutest baby animals. In the short time that our local network has been up, it has inspired a few other groups in Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. All of us manage our groups a little differently, but the Wuhan template remains the same: a small group of neighbors supporting one another during a time when movement is restricted, and knowledge of one\\u2019s immediate area is crucial. Having lived through SARS and contracted H1N1, I know from personal experience that hyperlocal contacts can mean the difference between life and death. When you\\u2019re sick and scared during a quarantine, it could likely be your neighbor, not your sister who lives three states away or overwhelmed health practitioners at hospitals who could help you in that moment. Many of us keep in touch with friends and colleagues across the globe but have never really gotten to know the people on our street or in our building. That needs to change, and fast. Federal and state responses to coronavirus are becoming more organized, but the magnitude of this crisis requires massively sustained bottom-up efforts too. This is why mutual-aid networks, caremongering, local delivery for at-risk populations, and neighborhood slack groups are being activated like wildfire across the US. We participate in tons of social networks as lurkers, broadcasters, or participants \\u2013 tiny drops in a sea of anonymity. But right now, following isn't enough. Hyperlocal groups create an opportunity to find commonality with those who live within walking distance, the people who most need your help and who are in the best position to help you. During uncertain times like these, we don\\u2019t just need to look to scientists, governments, and industry for leadership, we also need to look to each other. If you\\u2019re ready to start your own hyperlocal community network, here are step-by-step instructions with a link to a template and best practices.Tricia Wang is a human tech designer and cofounder of Sudden Compass.

Will We Repeat That Mistake?","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/sarahanderson1\/opinion-in-2008-we-bailed-out-companies-but-not-people","content":"Congress is rushing to pass an emergency bill that will devote at least $1 trillion \\u2014 and maybe much more, by some estimates \\u2014 to helping people and businesses impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. It\\u2019s desperately needed, given forecasts like 3 million job losses in the coming months and unemployment reaching 20%, let alone the devastating human toll of the virus itself. But powerful interests have a way of using crises to push through their own interests, often at the expense of the public. Many of the banks and financial institutions bailed out during the 2008 recession emerged even wealthier than they were before, while ordinary Americans suffered without help for years. So as Washington cooks up a massive stimulus bill, with little time for public input or scrutiny, there\\u2019s a real danger of repeating the enormous mistakes of the last recession. The bill could put help out of reach for the most vulnerable Americans and give the most powerful Americans a huge influence over the outcome. Policymakers should remember some of the biggest blunders from the crisis response back in 2008\\u20132009 and be pressured to never repeat them. Among the biggest: Nearly 10 million homeowners lost their homes to foreclosures as a result of the 2008 subprime mortgage fiasco. They got virtually nothing. Meanwhile, more than $1 trillion was handed out to save banks and other large corporations, many of which are now more valuable than they were then. There\\u2019s a major push underway to not repeat this moral travesty. Even the Trump administration is planning to send one-off checks directly to Americans as part of a $1 trillion stimulus package to help cushion families from the pain of an economic slowdown. Sen. Bernie Sanders has proposed an even bigger $2 trillion stimulus, which would see every household get $2,000 a month in direct assistance for the duration of the crisis. Sen. Sherrod Brown has just introduced a bill to protect homeowners by banning foreclosures for six months, in addition to other help. Eviction and rent moratorium efforts are taking off in areas around the country. Congress is working on other proposals to provide extended unemployment benefits, paid sick leave, and other supports. These need to be as strong as possible. In the aftermath of the 2008 crash, the federal government put some temporary CEO pay restrictions on a handful of companies that received mega-bailouts. But as taxpayer dollars flowed into the economy to blunt the crisis, other firms gave CEOs massive paychecks while contributing to the largest layoff wave since the Great Depression. At the 50 firms that had the largest layoffs between the onset of the crisis and early 2010, CEOs took home an average of nearly $12 million in 2009, 42% more than the S&P 500 average, an Institute for Policy Studies report found. In the face of the current crisis, the Trump administration is also asking for massive industry aid, including $50 billion for the airline industry and $150 billion for other distressed companies. This will be on top of the major stimulus program. There are better ways to help workers in these industries. The head of the flight attendants union has made a powerful case that the airline bailout money should come in the form of direct payroll subsidies to industry employees as a way to prevent layoffs. For the economy as a whole, we should consider following the Danish government\\u2019s lead. To stop layoffs over the next three months, it'll be providing as much as $3,300 per worker to cover 75% of wages, with employers covering the remaining 25%. We should be demanding additional measures to ensure that any bailout money helps workers instead of padding the pockets of CEOs and wealthy shareholders. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for instance, has laid out eight conditions, including a $15 minimum wage and giving workers a seat on the company's board of directors. Bailout recipients should also be required to cap CEO pay at no more than 50 times worker pay. It took 10 years for the US economy to recuperate from the 2008 crash, in large part because the economic stimulus program was too small. President Barack Obama\\u2019s chief economic adviser, Christina Romer, had proposed a package as large as $1.8 trillion, but Republicans and conservative Democrats whittled that down to just $787 billion. The small size of the stimulus was exacerbated by drastic budget-slashing after the tea party wave in the 2010 election. According to the Manhattan Institute, Congress enacted $889 billion worth of spending cuts over the last six years of Obama\\u2019s term. This time, we need to sustain stimulus spending until the economy becomes healthy. We also need to use the funds more strategically to help speed the transition away from fossil fuels and help the most vulnerable communities \\u2014 or else the resulting environmental catastrophes could dwarf the economic damage we\\u2019ve seen from the coronavirus so far. We could start with a massive initiative to retrofit buildings across the country, targeting the homes and public buildings in communities of color and low-income areas. As Basav Sen, climate expert at the Institute for Policy Studies, points out, retrofitting projects are \\u201Cshovel ready\\u201D because they require a low capital investment (as opposed to, say, building a new airport). They would also help reduce inequality, since families with low incomes spend a much bigger share of their income on energy than higher-income families. The solution is simple: Reverse the logic of the bailout during the 2008\\u20132009 crisis. This time, we need a sustained stimulus to bail out workers, people with low incomes, and the planet \\u2014 not the CEOs.Sarah Anderson directs the Global Economy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies."},{"author":"Rep.

This report also warns that long after the zero tolerance policy ended, the Border Patrol may still not be keeping accurate records of families who arrive on the Southwest Border. As chairs of the committees and subcommittees with jurisdiction on this matter, we have tried every avenue to obtain a full accounting of all child separations. Our efforts have been met with an intentional, unprecedented, and dangerous effort to impede Congressional oversight at every turn. Earlier this month, acting Secretary Chad Wolf \\u2014 already the fifth person to run the Department of Homeland Security under President Trump \\u2014 testified that \\u201Cthe Department has not lost any children\\u201D who were taken away from their families by the Border Patrol, a part of DHS. With any administration, but especially this one, we simply cannot assume officials\\u2019 assertions are accurate. Our committees have been trying to obtain the documents that would enable us to determine if acting Secretary Wolf told us the truth. We requested these documents more than a year ago, and today we are still waiting. DHS has still not provided even a fraction of the documents we need. And much of what DHS has produced has been completely useless for the purposes of Congressional oversight. For example, although the few documents that DHS has produced are clearly not classified and do not invoke questions of executive privilege, hundreds of the pages have been heavily redacted without reason or justification. The only thing that is crystal clear is that there is much the Administration does not want us to know. As we have continued to seek the documents we need to account for separated children, we and our colleagues have asked Inspectors General and the Government Accountability Office to examine the family separations. As a result of these independent reviews, we now know that DHS and other federal agencies failed to develop even the most basic plans and systems to track children and parents and ensure they could be quickly reunited. For example, last November, the DHS Inspector General found that \\u201CDHS did not have the information technology (IT) system functionality needed to track separated migrant families during the execution of the Zero Tolerance Policy.\\u201D As a result, the Inspector General \\u201Ccould not validate the total number of separations\\u201D or the number of children who had been reunited with their families. And after conducting an in-depth analysis of DHS data, the Inspector General identified more than 1,000 children whose family relationships may not have been accurately recorded in DHS\\u2019 faulty databases. Earlier this month, the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services issued a report finding that HHS was not warned by DHS that thousands of children would be separated from their families under the zero tolerance policy \\u2014 even though HHS was the department that would be required to take care of these children. The HHS Inspector General also found that, \\u201CHHS and DHS did not routinely collect and share the information necessary to identify, track, or connect families separated by DHS.\\u201D Today, we are releasing the results of a GAO investigation we requested. GAO found that DHS personnel \\u201Chave not accurately and consistently recorded family units and separations\\u201D \\u2014 and such record-keeping failures continued even after the zero tolerance policy ended. After reviewing a small sample of cases, GAO found a staggering 60 percent of the family separations examined in the sample were not correctly documented per Border Patrol\\u2019s own policy. GAO warned, \\u201Cit is unclear whether Border Patrol has accurate records of all separated parents and children.\\u201D Once the Trump administration has separated children from their families, DHS becomes responsible not only for the physical custody of each child but also for knowing the most fundamental fact of each child\\u2019s life: the family to which each child belongs. The stunning findings from three separate watchdogs strongly suggest that we do not yet know with certainty even the number of children the Trump administration took away from migrant families \\u2014 much less whether DHS truly knows the identity of each separated child\\u2019s family. Acting Secretary Wolf should immediately provide our committees all of the documents we have asked for so we can understand the full consequences of the zero tolerance policy. If the acting secretary is sure that no separated children have been lost, there is no excuse for DHS to continue to hide the consequences of its actions.Rep. Bennie G.

It\\u2019s also home to at least 12 drug plants supplying the US with everything from painkillers to antibiotics. And beyond Hubei, an estimated 80% of pharmaceutical ingredients are sourced from China and India (which, in turn, sources nearly 80% of its drug ingredients from China). Our ability to make and distribute medicine here in the United States is falling apart, and it\\u2019s a direct result of the consolidation of the supply chains and factories that make it. The Cardizem shortage of 2018 began when Hurricane Maria knocked out power to a handful of factories in Puerto Rico that produce saline bags used around the world for administering intravenous medications. Those few days of lost production in Puerto Rico caused Cardizem supplies to be backlogged for months. Pharmaceutical producers put most of their eggs in one basket, and the hurricane upset the basket. The coronavirus could disturb a much bigger basket \\u2014 the majority of pharmaceutical drugs globally. Since at least 2005, hospital administrators and patients have experienced the fragility of the drug supply chain. Policymakers have failed to address the root cause. Why did we consolidate and thin out supply chains so aggressively? The answer is found in the behavior of \\u201Cpower buyers,\\u201D corporations in the drug supply chain that buy a lot of product and subsequently have the power to set prices. Power buyers like CVS or the group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which hospitals use to buy everything from surgical gowns to generic drugs, have consolidated the drug supply chain, squeezing manufacturers to get rid of all their redundant sources of supply \\u2014 or, even riskier, ship off their production to China. Indeed, it\\u2019s consolidation all the way down: Many of these GPOs outsource even further, purchasing their generic drugs through separate power buyer entities. For example, Cardinal Health, the fifth-largest GPO in the country, runs a joint venture called Red Oak Sourcing with CVS Health, the largest pharmacy chain, to handle purchasing for Cardinal, CVS, Target, Omnicare (which sources for approximately 50% of all nursing homes), and OptumRx (the drug division of UnitedHealth Group). Other power buyers cover purchasing for Walmart, Walgreens, and Express Scripts. The market is so consolidated that just four of these power buyers control over 90% of generic drug purchasing for the entire country. This consolidation might not seem like a bad thing. After all, generic drugs are cheap; a course of generic antibiotics may cost no more than $5 to the consumer. But power buyers have driven prices below a sustainable level for the producer. Their consolidated buying power \\u2014 also called monopsony power \\u2014 has lowered margins on generic drugs such that many manufacturers have consolidated to match their bargaining power or offshored their production lines to eke out whatever margin they can. Drug shortages aren't the only consequence of this. Power buyers act similarly to the way Walmart handles purchasing for its more than 5,000 stores, demanding extremely low prices from suppliers and forcing them to either fold or move production to cheaper labor markets overseas. US factories close, production moves offshore, and the result is a loss of diversity and resiliency for the entire supply chain in return for slightly lower prices. Common goods, including garden hoses, TVs, air conditioner parts, and car parts are now all in shortage. In the coming weeks and months, the coronavirus pandemic is likely to reveal the hidden risk embedded in the low consumer prices for medical supplies, just like the financial crisis forced hidden risks back on the balance sheet of major banks. Reports indicate the FDA is now carefully monitoring 150 drugs for anticipated shortages due to the outbreak. As lawmakers and experts consider solutions to fix the fragile medical supply chain, many are focused on having the FDA gain visibility into our supply chain and relocating supply chains away from China. These approaches are a good start, but they also fail to address the root of the problem. Rather than solely focusing on the country of origin of the supply chains, lawmakers and regulators should be focused on the market power issues that caused the problem. Regulatory solutions like breaking apart the power buyers of drugs and legislative solutions like banning contracts that guarantee massive purchasers the lowest possible price would allow the supply chain to rediversify. And diverse supply chains are better able to respond to a catastrophe. We\\u2019re far beyond just manageable shortages. The coronavirus is forcing lawmakers to confront the weakness of US supply chains; the solutions should go beyond the short-term crisis and address the concentrated corporate power that\\u2019s at fault.Olivia Webb is a policy analyst with the American Economic Liberties Project."},{"author":"Amy Meng","title":"The Coronavirus Response Shows How Crucial Accessibility Is","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/amymeng\/coronavirus-working-from-home-disability-accessibility","content":"The journalists at BuzzFeed News are proud to bring you trustworthy and relevant reporting about the coronavirus.

The list of organizations and events migrating to online platforms multiplies daily. Moving these hubs of in-person interaction to a virtual space is a critical part of flattening the curve of coronavirus spread \\u2014 and although I\\u2019m sure these changes were not always simple to enact, the last few weeks have shown they are exceedingly possible. Seeing these dramatic changes implemented in a span of weeks has been heartening. It has also been deeply frustrating for those of us in the disability community, who've been asking for these accommodations \\u2014 and been told they're simply not feasible \\u2014 for our entire working lives. Disability advocates like Karrie Higgins have been quick to point out that these same accommodations have long been requested by people in the disability community, and long been denied. Using the hashtags #AccessibilityforAbleds and #DisabledAndSaltyAF, the disability community is gathering stories and keeping receipts of accommodations that they have found extremely difficult to obtain, or flat-out been refused, but that are now being rapidly adopted. The perception is accommodations like online instruction, paying for sick leave, and single-use products have been deemed too difficult, or not worthwhile, to provide to the disability community \\u2014 but organizations are willing and able to provide now that the health of able-bodied people is at stake. I understand we are in the middle of a terrible public health crisis, and I don\\u2019t mean to take away from the seriousness of this situation \\u2014 instead, I want to encourage people to pay even closer attention to changes taking place now. Disability is generally very misunderstood and very unacknowledged, even though approximately 25% of Americans live with a disability. The last few years have delivered important gains in representation along many axes of diversity, but representation of people with disabilities has lagged. As a result, the narratives about what a disabled person can look like, or what disability means, remains extremely limited. Embarrassingly, I was almost 30 before I learned that it was possible to have an invisible disability \\u2014 and that I was someone who qualified as disabled. When I was 20, I began to feel electric shocks in the right side of my face. I felt it first only when brushing my teeth. Then when chewing any kind of food. Eventually, even cold air over my face or lips set off blinding shocks. I saw half a dozen doctors and dentists, but no one could see anything wrong. The shocks got worse and worse: It felt like electrified barbed wire being continually flossed through my right jaw, eye, and cheek. Five months after the initial onset, I sent myself to NYU\\u2019s emergency room after almost blacking out in pain. There, a kind Texan dental resident diagnosed me with a chronic pain condition called trigeminal neuralgia (TN). TN is a rare condition that typically only impacts one side of the face (though some people have bilateral TN) and is widely regarded as one of the most painful known medical conditions. It is nicknamed \\u201Cthe suicide disease.\\u201DThere is no surefire treatment for trigeminal neuralgia, and it generally doesn\\u2019t respond to pain medication. In fact, the pain increases in frequency and intensity over the course of one\\u2019s life. Over the years, I saw countless specialists and countless charlatans, took many cocktails of medication, and underwent dozens of medical procedures. Some of it helped a little; some of it helped a lot; none of it ever helped for long. As this happened, my life went on. I worked as an adjunct professor, writer, and office manager. I cultivated tricks that helped me get through speaking engagements: I only smiled with the left side of my face, and chewed on the left side of my mouth. I told jokes or asked students to read text out loud, which gave me a few seconds to stop talking. Throughout my twenties, I kept this equation running: Which hours of today can I least afford to be in pain? Which hours of today can I most afford to be in pain? How much pain do I think I can be in before I\\u2019m no longer effective at what I\\u2019m doing? Sitting for long stretches of time and increases in air pressure would reliably flare up my neuralgia, so I generally turned down engagements that required extensive travel \\u2014 but I was living on an adjunct professor\\u2019s salary and couldn\\u2019t afford to turn down all of them. I had one medication I took on an in-case-of-emergency basis (primarily because of the price tag: $200 for 60 pills). Prior to flights, I did what many poor Americans do and hoarded medicine to ensure I\\u2019d have enough to tide me through the post-flight pain spike, as well as the major speaking and networking obligations. As a trade-off, I spent the days before flights sequestered at home practicing disgusting personal hygiene, while speaking and eating as little as possible. For 10 years, this method of hoarding medicine and hoarding sick days worked well enough, until I was finally referred for a surgery that might give me a shot at being pain-free. A microvascular decompression craniotomy (MVD) is a three- to four-hour brain surgery that requires drilling a quarter-inch hole through the skull to wrap Teflon around the trigeminal nerve, insulating it from further compression. It\\u2019s a scary and serious surgery that isn\\u2019t guaranteed to work, but it was the first hope I had of truly alleviating my neuralgia. I said yes without hesitation.It was in the lead-up to my surgery that I was finally introduced to the disability community. When looking for people who had gone through an MVD, I began to find support groups online, many of which pointed me to chronic pain groups, and then wider disability networks. The more I read about the experiences of people with disabilities, the more I saw my own experience. The differences between myself and able-bodied people came into sudden, sharp focus. For the first time in 10 years, I realized an able-bodied person doesn\\u2019t experience pain so intense it hinders their swallowing or breathing reflex. An able-bodied person doesn\\u2019t get jolted awake by electric shocks every 20 minutes the entire night. An able-bodied person isn\\u2019t in constant negotiation with their body. For many in the disability community, this is just the reality of our bodies. And we figure it out. Even when we\\u2019ve been told telecommunication is not possible. Even when we\\u2019ve been told online instruction is not possible. Even when we\\u2019ve been told paid sick leave is not possible.America\\u2019s response to the coronavirus has exposed many, many systemic shortcomings \\u2014 the vulnerability of tipped workers, the lack of standardized paid sick leave, and the tenuous capacity of the health care system, to start \\u2014 but it\\u2019s also shown our capacity for positive change. The willingness to move classes, conferences, events, work, and interviews online for the sake of public health is a great indicator of what could happen in the future. Seeing this changing day by day, I can\\u2019t help but think: What about all the times the same organizations said no to these accommodations? And what happens to these new initiatives after the coronavirus becomes less of an imminent threat? Maybe this experience means all these organizations will see the benefits of remote work. Maybe a silver lining to COVID-19 is increased flexibility in these policies across the board. Having that option would be a boon to many in the disability community \\u2014 and would have massive benefits beyond the disability community. But it\\u2019s hard to be hopeful. One of the first things I learned when I started reading about the disability community was the spoon theory. Created by Christine Miserandino, the idea goes like this: Think about the energy you have every day represented in the form of spoons. Healthy, able-bodied people tend to have an unlimited number of spoons. Every action you take consumes one spoon, but because you are healthy and able-bodied, with unlimited spoons, it\\u2019s no big deal. You might go running in the morning, and then commute to work while reading the paper; you might grab lunch with a friend, and then go on a date; you might end the night at home, watching Netflix after picking up some ice cream from the bodega. On the other hand, if you have a disability or a chronic illness, you have a limited number of spoons every day. Every action you take consumes one spoon, and after each step, you\\u2019re left to consider what you can do with the spoons you have left. Sometimes you finish getting ready for your day and you\\u2019ve already used half your spoons, so you have to be strategic about where the rest go. You might be able to borrow spoons from the next day, or save spoons \\u2014 similar to how I used to hoard medication \\u2014 but it means you borrow against yourself, and that is a debt you will always have to pay. It can\\u2019t be solely the task of someone with a limited supply of spoons to fight for accommodations that have widespread benefit, especially when there are people with unlimited spoons sitting right next to them. During this coronavirus outbreak, healthy, able-bodied people have been important allies to more vulnerable populations and stood alongside members of these communities. Now that we\\u2019ve seen the kind of accommodations that are possible, we should work to formalize these into permanent policies. Allowing more flexible and standardized teleconferencing policies across the board is not just helpful for the disability community: It can be helpful for people who are immunosuppressed; for new parents; for the environment; for people who can\\u2019t afford the plane ticket; for people who are caretakers; for people with social anxiety \\u2014 the list goes on.I have been extraordinarily lucky. I underwent my MVD surgery in April 2019, and since that time I have had no more pain from trigeminal neuralgia. For the first time in a decade, I do not need to take any daily medication. I can eat and breathe and move without constantly monitoring my body. Some things do remain: I have a permanent wad of Teflon in my brain, which protects my trigeminal nerve; I have a titanium plate covering the borehole in my skull; I have a 5-inch scar under my hair; and if you touch the right side of my skull, you can feel a permanent dent at the incision site. Although my neurosurgeon has a great track record, the trigeminal neuralgia could return anytime. Every few months, I run the equations again: How old might I be when this happens? What other medical conditions might I have at that point? Should I undergo brain surgery again? What if I continue to relapse? Out of curiosity, how much more can my skull sink in? What if next time there are no more options? It is easy to forget physical pain. Once recovered, it is easy to forget what illness felt like \\u2014 as the saying goes, \\u201Chealth is a crown only the sick can see.\\u201D I lived with neuralgia for so long it will always be part of me. And for all us, in this moment of pandemic, we are learning about ourselves as individuals, as members of a community, and as people capable of compelling change in institutions and organizations that would otherwise resist change indefinitely. Even when the pandemic is over; even when the vaccines have been distributed; even when we trickle back into schools and offices; remember this time when you fought to help people, to be a good citizen and an inclusive neighbor. Then do it again. ●"},{"author":"Tom Gara","title":"Cheaper Oil Means Cheaper Gas. So Why Are Markets Crashing?","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/tomgara\/cheaper-oil-cheaper-gas-why-markets-crash","content":"There\\u2019s an old rule of thumb used by economists: For every 1-cent drop in the price of a gallon of gas, Americans have an extra billion dollars of money to spend on something else. That used to mean it was good news when the price of oil went down, which it did by more than 30% today after Saudi Arabia announced it would flood the market with extra oil and slash prices as part of a price war with Russia. When gas got cheaper at the pump, drivers would end up with more money to spend on other stuff, and because energy was cheaper, all the other stuff produced using energy would be cheaper too. But in the spirit of everything in the world now being broken, that rule of thumb is now kind of broken too. The US has become the world\\u2019s largest oil producer, and states from North Dakota to Louisiana and Texas are home to oil drilling boomtowns full of high-paying blue-collar jobs. That\\u2019s mostly good news, aside from the way it destroys our environment and dooms our future. But it also means that the other side of the oil price equation now matters much more. When oil becomes cheap, oil producers get into financial trouble, scale back their drilling, and lay off workers. So do the companies, based all over the country, that supply the oil industry with everything from pipes to trucks and catered meals. That\\u2019s why the US economy didn\\u2019t go into boomtime when oil prices last crashed in 2015 and 2016, falling from more than $100 a barrel to less than $40. Gas prices dropped below $2 a gallon, and people celebrated by buying new cars in record numbers and spending more on holiday shopping. But by the end of 2015, there had been 60,000 jobs lost in the oil and gas industry in Texas alone and the booming oil towns of North Dakota were seeing an exodus of jobs and people.Today, as stock markets around the world went into panic mode over the combined implications of crashing oil prices and a global viral outbreak, American oil companies tanked harder than almost anyone. Dozens of oil companies each lost more than a third of their total value, some lost more than half. If the oil price stays this low, many will close down oil rigs in the coming weeks and months, and some will go bust. This isn't the first time it\\u2019s happened. A drop in oil prices dragged down the overall growth of the US economy in 2015 and 2016, meaning Barack Obama\\u2019s presidency ended with the slowest year of economic growth since the end of the financial crisis. That \\u201Cmini recession,\\u201D centered around the oil industry during the 2016 election cycle, was \\u201Cthe most consequential event for understanding the economy and politics of today that most people didn't even realize was happening,\\u201D the New York Times' Neil Irwin wrote in 2018. There\\u2019s a next-level problem that comes up once those companies start struggling. They become less likely to pay back the money they borrowed, and banks start worrying about how many bad loans they\\u2019ve made \\u2014 and start making fewer loans to other companies and people they think might be risky. \\u201CThat ultimately is the negative aspect to lower oil,\\u201D Viktor Hjort from French bank BNP Paribas told the Wall Street Journal today. \\u201CThere is a real risk, and that is tighter credit conditions.\\u201D \\u201CTighter credit conditions\\u201D is a phrase that will make pretty much anyone who had a pulse and a bank account between 2008 and 2011 shiver, and it\\u2019s not the sentence you want to be reading if you\\u2019re trying to get reelected as president later this year.Donald Trump, who has centered his campaign around the strength of the economy and the booming stock market, seems to be tweeting through it. \\u201CGood for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!\\u201D he posted this morning. The previous evening he retweeted a photo of himself smiling serenely while playing the fiddle."},{"author":"Dan Werb","title":"Resist The Authoritarian Response To The Coronavirus","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/danwerb\/esist-the-authoritarian-response-to-coronavirus","content":"Public health officials escorted by armed police through the epicenter of an outbreak. Government officials, in an effort to contain an epidemic, announcing rules forcing people off the streets. City residents fearing for their lives as a new virus kills the frail and infirm among them. That same fear leads to widespread support for draconian public health measures as long as they keep people safe. The spread of the coronavirus has reminded us of the darker side of epidemic control. These kinds of \\\"security-forward\\\" responses are among the most common ways we deal with epidemics. While the COVID-19 epidemic has made these scenes familiar to us all, the above description applies just as well to the disease epicenter of Wuhan, China, as it does to how authorities right here in the US have responded to both real and perceived local epidemics. Consider Los Angeles, where the same enforcement-based approach favored by China\\u2019s government is, with little fanfare, being deployed to fight a more localized outbreak. The epidemic in question? Flea-borne typhus (Rickettsia typhi), a relatively benign member of a group of bacterial pathogens better known for causing deadly epidemics in Medieval Europe starting in the 15th century. Since the advent of modern antibiotics, typhus has been a preventable disease, and flea-borne typhus is rare in the US. So when the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health announced in 2018 that the number of yearly cases of flea-borne typhus had suddenly doubled to over 60 \\u2014 and that a majority of the ill were people who were homeless \\u2014 the reaction was swift. News articles with headlines like \\u201CCalifornia Sees Resurgence of \\u2018Medieval Diseases\\u2019\\u201D and \\u201CAre LA's Medieval Diseases Coming to Your City?\\u201D stoked a climate of fear and made the city\\u2019s residents who were experiencing homeless their main target. The result was a new layer of security imposed upon Skid Row in the name of public health: sanitation workers wielding hoses, bleach, and trash compactors, escorted by a platoon of police to do daily cleanups. Their mandate? Destroy or seize any encampments and belongings that might contribute to the spread of disease. The battle to clean up Skid Row has been waged for decades, but the added dimension of disease transformed it from a gentrifying mission into a wholescale public health battle against a terrifying epidemic. Suddenly, \\\"cleaning up the streets\\\" took on a more literal \\u2014 and urgent \\u2014 dimension. Just 130 miles due south of Skid Row, in the Mexican border town of Tijuana, we recently saw another example of public health deployed as a useful pretext to take action against undesirable populations. When a caravan of Central American migrants numbering in the thousands arrived in Tijuana in 2018, the Trump administration made clear how vehemently opposed it was to even considering their claims for asylum. The extent of the administration\\u2019s hostility soon became obvious with the deployment of 15,000 troops to the border amid the announcement of a national emergency. While Donald Trump has from the outset of his presidency articulated a xenophobic vision of America, it was notable that the justification for his heavy-handed response to the migrant caravan was articulated in the language of public health and disease. Within a subset of right-leaning media, the trope that the 2,700-strong caravan was riddled with HIV\\\/AIDS, tuberculosis, and chicken pox was repeated ad nauseam, even from the president himself. It was a chilling case of the dehumanizing potential of epidemic language, and a defining moment in Trump's presidency. While COVID-19, LA\\u2019s Skid Row, and Tijuana\\u2019s migrant caravan have little in common, they have all produced a common outcome: a fear of epidemics that has made us willing to accept restrictions that we would otherwise decry as infringing deeply upon our inalienable rights. In China, which has gone further than anywhere else in combining totalitarian politics with state-of-the-art surveillance technology, the fear of a generalized pandemic has given President Xi Jinping\\u2019s government maximum leeway to crack down on its citizens. The international community has mostly applauded the Chinese government\\u2019s response. In January, four weeks after the initial outbreak, the World Health Organization praised China for the \\u201Ccommitment from top leadership, and the transparency they have demonstrated.\\u201D By late February, the scientist who led a WHO mission to assess the situation on the ground in the country stated it plainly: \\\"Hundreds of thousands of people in China didn't get COVID-19 because of their aggressive response.\\u201D It\\u2019s clear that epidemics of this magnitude require a dedicated response, and at least some of the controls that China put in place have likely saved lives. What\\u2019s less clear, though, is which ones actually moved the needle, and which ones \\u2014 like censoring coronavirus posts on the popular social messaging app WeChat \\u2014 may have inadvertently caused more cases to go undetected. While perhaps meant to defuse global panic, the praise from the international body allowed the Chinese government to sidestep mounting criticisms of delays, censorship, and the detention of doctors who publicly voiced concerns about the epidemic. And with the number of cases still growing \\u2014 roughly 93,000 cases and over 3,100 deaths globally so far \\u2014 some experts are starting to question the effectiveness of blanket curfews and police-enforced quarantine zones. But it\\u2019s not just China\\u2019s extreme responses to the COVID-19 epidemic that are under scrutiny. Much closer to home, experts are recognizing that one of the most dangerous symptoms of any epidemic \\u2014 be it real or fabricated \\u2014 is fear. Ricky Bluthenthal, associate dean of social justice at the University of Southern California\\u2019s Keck School of Medicine, works just a few miles east of LA\\u2019s Skid Row, though he is often found in the neighborhood meeting with frontline workers and residents who are homeless. From his vantage point, the single biggest impact of the flea-borne typhus outbreak has been a ratcheting up of fear of people who are homeless. That, in turn, has provided the city government with broad impunity to achieve long-standing security and beautification goals. \\u201CLiterally every day they are breaking up homeless encampments,\\u201D Bluthenthal said. \\u201CThey clean up 40 locations a day. Occasionally they\\u2019ll make a public health argument for it, but sometimes they won\\u2019t. Because the truth is that breaking up the encampments is about political realities; it\\u2019s not about the health of the homeless people or the health of the community.\\u201D Under the direction of Mayor Eric Garcetti, the city of LA launched the aggressive, daily sweeps in 2018 at a cost of $30 million per year. Given the stakes, officials claim that the city government had been left with no choice but to take draconian steps to, in the words of a city spokesperson, \\u201Ckeep our streets and sidewalks safe for everyone.\\u201D Bluthenthal sees a direct link between epidemic fear and widespread public acceptance of policies that would otherwise be recognized as nakedly authoritarian. \\u201CIt\\u2019s kind of a disaster. We just keep digging the ditch deeper by making people more vulnerable and disrupting their lives,\\u201D he said. The upshot is that effective solutions to homelessness, which are often more complicated and take longer to implement, are a hard sell for scared citizens who favor the quick fix of daily crackdowns. \\u201CMobile or walk-in centers where people can deal with their natural needs and get cleaned up,\\u201D said Bluthenthal, running down a list. \\u201CDaily trash pickup and deploying garbage cans so that people can throw their stuff away easily. Giving people lockers that are publicly available so that they can store their most valuable things on a regular basis.\\u201D These, he said, are just some of the ways that the city could reduce the risk of disease while also increasing the resilience of people who are homeless. In the case of the migrant caravan, the use of epidemic language was wildly successful in helping the Trump administration gain support for its anti-immigration goals, despite the absence of an actual epidemic. After migrant families \\u2014 including mothers with infants and small children \\u2014 gathered at the border fence in Tijuana, the US military fired tear gas and rubber bullets to violently disperse the asylum-seekers. That military response foreshadowed the cruelty the migrants would endure once detained by the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the ongoing separation of migrant families and long-term detention of young children. While the street sweeps in Skid Row and the caging of immigrant children have little to do with the spread of COVID-19, all three episodes make plain the power \\u2014 and peril \\u2014 of stoking fear of epidemics. Bluthenthal, the public health expert, has seen firsthand how ineffective the security-forward approach can be in trying to stem disease. \\u201CIt seems crazy to try to quarantine your fifth-largest city,\\u201D he said of Chinese efforts to create a perimeter around a city of 11 million people. \\u201CFrom a public health history standpoint, I don\\u2019t think that anyone\\u2019s tried to do that before.\\u201D Bluthenthal is right: The scale of the security perimeter that Xi\\u2019s government has imposed on China to contain COVID-2019 is truly unprecedented, and it speaks to the faith the Chinese government has in its own capacity to control its population by any means necessary. And despite that, there has been a surge of COVID-19 cases in Italy, South Korea, Japan, and Iran in recent weeks, and many observers are now convinced that a global pandemic is more than likely. All of this has renewed questions about the effectiveness of a Chinese authoritarian response that leaned heavily on twin fears: of the virus itself and of severe punishment for those who contravene the government quarantine. What\\u2019s clear, though, is that far from the exception, China\\u2019s muscular response is a prime example of how governments tend toward authoritarianism in the face of an epidemic. As the COVID-19 epidemic continues to spread, our ability to recognize the line between effective public health and all-out repression will continue to be tested. With COVID-19 now spreading to every continent except Antarctica, we can start to compare different governmental responses to the virus and tease out which components \\u2014 even those as basic but effective as calls for people to consistently wash their hands \\u2014 can help stem the epidemic, and which \\u2014 like threats of severe punishment \\u2014 might make things worse. Only then will we really know which aspects of China\\u2019s response were effective, and which were simply pretext for authoritarian action. Let\\u2019s hope the line between the two doesn\\u2019t disappear completely in the face of our terror at becoming infected.Dan Werb, PhD, is an epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego.

But there\\u2019s another aspect to his campaign that deserves more scorn, if we\\u2019re ever to take him seriously at all: the truly pathetic lack of vision and ambition on display from someone who should be most familiar with the importance of both. If you pay attention to what he\\u2019s actually saying in his stump speeches and his firehose of TV commercials, as I unfortunately have been recently, what jumps out is the lack of any idea big enough to match the moment we're living in. His ads, more than half a billion dollars\\u2019 worth so far, are banal and generic. There\\u2019s nothing there. A snippet from one of his early ads: \\\"He could\\u2019ve just been the middle-class kid who made good, but Mike Bloomberg became the guy who did good.\\\" Another included a gem about Mike\\u2019s desire to \\u201Crestore faith in the dream that defines us,\\u201D where \\u201Cthe wealthy will pay more in taxes and the middle-class get their fair share.\\u201D We\\u2019re not in the presence of a maestro here. Consider his promise to untangle the health care morass with a solution only a next-level thinker could come up with: \\u201CEveryone without health insurance can get it, and everyone who likes theirs, keep it.\\u201D Now compare Bloomberg\\u2019s TV spot to Lyndon Johnson when he launched his War on Poverty. \\u201COur aim is not only to relieve the symptoms of poverty, but to cure it and, above all, to prevent it,\\\" Johnson said. Sure, it was just a line in a speech. But the war on poverty included the passage of Medicare, which changed our country for good and ultimately gave tens of millions of seniors a lifeline. John F. Kennedy knew how important the space race was in 1961 when he asked Congress for a trainload full of money to get to the moon \\\"before this decade is out,\\\" which we did. He framed it as a way to checkmate the Russians militarily. Dwight Eisenhower got Congress to increase gasoline taxes (try to imagine that now) to start construction on the interstate highway system, which he sold, in part, as a national defense project. It changed the country and the electoral map forever, and the Transcontinental Railroad finally connected the nation from coast to coast.Michael Bloomberg has shown no sign he believes we can do big things again. Perhaps his most ambitious plan is simply managing to win an election. \\u201CDefeating Donald Trump \\u2014 and rebuilding America \\u2014 is the most urgent and important fight of our lives,\\u201D he\\u2019s said. He is counting on his lack of vision to carry the day, with the help of as much of his fortune he can spend. Ross Perot thought his wealth would give him an upset in 1992 when he ran against Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush \\u2014 his favorite talking points were about \\\"looking under the hood\\\" of a car and fixing everything, including \\u2014 drumroll \\u2014 \\u201Cwaste in government.\\u201D He received 19% of the vote and soon disappeared from the national stage. There\\u2019s nothing new to this Bloombergian smallness of vision. Last year, when asked about the Green New Deal that is supported by so many leading progressives, Bloomberg said he was \\u201Ca little bit tired of listening to things that are pie in the sky, that are never going to pass, and we\\u2019re never going to afford.\\\" \\u201CI think it\\u2019s just disingenuous to promote those things,\\u201D he said. This brand of cynical, insidious advice to Americans \\u2014 to stop dreaming big, to keep counting their pennies, and stay mired in a sense of hopelessness \\u2014 has been rightly abandoned by the people currently leading the Democratic primary race. And a man who owes his fortune and political prominence to the greatness of New York City should know better. The wonder that is New York exists thanks in large part to the kind of pie-in-the-sky projects \\u2014 impossibly ambitious, realized despite the objections of naysayers and budget curmudgeons \\u2014 that Bloomberg now dismisses. The state\\u2019s sixth governor, DeWitt Clinton, proposed building a canal that would run from the Great Lakes to the Hudson River. His opponents called it \\u201CClinton\\u2019s Folly\\u201D and \\u201CClinton\\u2019s Ditch,\\u201D and predicted all manner of doom. When the Erie Canal was completed in 1825, it made New York the economic powerhouse it still is today. Bloomberg probably would have thought it was similarly unrealistic to propose building the New York City subway system, which carries 6 million people a day. Without it, the city would be a collection of small towns. One can only guess the contempt he\\u2019d have for an idea like the State University of New York, strung together by Nelson Rockefeller from a group of small community colleges and transformed into a system that still provides hundreds of thousands of students with an affordable, quality education every year.In his biography of Nelson Rockefeller, Richard Norton Smith quotes him as saying \\u201Cthere is no problem that can\\u2019t be solved.\\u201D He never said \\u201Cwe can't afford it.\\u201D And there is no record of him bragging on a campaign platform about how rich he was (he really didn't want anyone to know). Bloomberg\\u2019s approach comes from a less visionary tradition, which also has precedents in New York. Before there was President Trump, New York\\u2019s Democratic governor Hugh Carey, whose family was in the oil business, announced at his inauguration in 1975 that \\u201Cthe days of wine and roses are over\\u201D \\u2014 an astonishing insult in a state that had elected Al Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt, the two creators of the New Deal, to the governorship. Carey wasn\\u2019t kidding: Within a year, he and the Democratic mayor of New York, Abe Beame \\u2014 whose parents were Socialists \\u2014 ended free tuition at the City University of New York, which had been in effect since 1847. Bill Clinton went a step further in 1993, proclaiming an end to the \\u201Cera of big government.\\u201D It was the kind of language you expected to hear on Fox News, not from a Democratic president. The result is a country whose philosophy has changed from unbridled optimism to defeated penny-pinching \\u2014 unless, of course, the vast public outlays are directed to big businesses and billion-dollar sports stadiums owned by billionaires. When people like Michael Bloomberg say the Green New Deal is unrealistic, remember the half-trillion-dollar TARP program to bail out the financial sector. Just about anything can magically become realistic if it benefits the right people: the General Motors bailout, vast subsidies for giant agricultural corporations, or the zero dollars in real estate taxes paid by the Dolan family, owners of Madison Square Garden, and the $360 million tax break for Donald Trump's Grand Hyatt in New York. Thankfully, an optimistic spirit is again rearing its head. You\\u2019re seeing it in the progressive grassroots, the high school activists \\u2014 and in the Democratic presidential race, where big ideas for the future are once again in vogue. Today it\\u2019s the people who reflexively say \\u201Cthis can\\u2019t be done\\u201D who we should be worried about. They\\u2019re the ones who\\u2019ve lost touch with the best traditions of our politics. You can hear their chorus of concerns every time these big ideas are floated: Medicare for All? Impossible. Free public college? Too expensive. Tax those who can afford it at a higher rate? Never. These people have given up \\u2014 they should be benched, or sent back to the minor leagues.Jim Callaghan has been writing about New York as a reporter, editor, columnist, and publisher since 1978."},{"author":"Shannon Keating","title":"Opinion: Bernie Sanders Is A Straight White Man. Does That Matter?","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/shannonkeating\/bernie-sanders-identity-politics-democratic-primary-2020","content":"During the Las Vegas Democratic presidential primary debate last month, former mayor Pete Buttigieg \\u2014 who yesterday dropped out of the race \\u2014 accused Sen. Bernie Sanders of a failure in leadership when it comes to reigning in his army of supposedly toxic supporters. \\u201CI think you have to accept some responsibility and ask yourself what it is about your campaign in particular that seems to be motivating this behavior more than others,\\u201D Buttigieg said. It was Sen. Elizabeth Warren to whom the question about Bernie Bros was first directed, and to her credit she didn\\u2019t opt to smear the diverse coalition of progressive voters working to elect Sanders \\u2014 likely realizing that they\\u2019re potential constituents who value many of the same things she does. Instead, she pivoted to point out who, in her view, was the biggest threat on that stage to Democratic unity and progress: former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. But for other candidates, the opportunity to pile on the Democratic frontrunner for the actions of his most visibly and vocally aggressive followers \\u2014 who, granted, probably aren\\u2019t Russian bots, as Sanders has insinuated \\u2014 was too good to pass up. After Buttigieg got in a few jabs, the Vermont senator pointed out (correctly) that the black women involved in leading his campaign are also victims of \\u201Cvicious, racist, sexist attacks\\u201D from other candidates\\u2019 supporters. Though they\\u2019d rather not admit it, every single candidate in the race has been able to claim quite a few asshole surrogates and supporters (including Buttigieg!). It is true, however, that Sanders\\u2019 fans \\u2014 of whom there are many, especially the young and Very Online \\u2014 are particularly loud on social media. Sanders has wholeheartedly condemned the harassment and bullying carried out in his name since the \\u201CBros\\u201D first became a problem for him back in 2016, after which his top aides privately reached out to senior officials at opposing campaigns to apologize for the sexist and racist swarms. Still, by this point, the Bro narrative has been rather exhaustively overhyped, to the extent that the campaign insists it\\u2019s become a distraction and a smear. Particularly because he\\u2019s an old white guy \\u2014 and a cranky one, at that \\u2014 Sanders is frequently assumed to inspire the worst and most bigoted impulses in the people who support him, regardless of their own race and gender. One Sanders skeptic claims he is \\u201Ca man who defines himself around his anger, and he attracts a lot of men who define themselves around their anger, many of whom do, in fact, use it as a license to act abusively.\\u201D Another explains his rapidly expanding, diversifying base with the theory that \\u201Csome young women and some young people of color want to be more like angry white men.\\u201D Bernie fans who aren\\u2019t men must have \\u201Cinternalized misogyny,\\u201D this theory goes, while his many supporters of color have \\u201Cinternalized white supremacy.\\u201D When (white male) identity and its resultant \\u201Ctoxic masculinity\\u201D is assumed to be the driving force of a candidate\\u2019s campaign, it follows that a woman candidate would offer something radically different. Amy Klobuchar, who has reportedly run \\u201Ca workplace controlled by fear, anger, and shame\\u201D in which she \\u201Cdemeaned and berated her staff almost daily, subjecting them to bouts of explosive rage and regular humiliation,\\u201D even went so far at the Las Vegas debate as to suggest that we could stop sexism on the internet by nominating a woman for president. The whole exchange in Vegas perfectly illustrated how a certain brand of neoliberal identity politics, popularized in the Obama era, feels increasingly insufficient to address the most pressing issues of our time. We might all agree, for example, that social media has contributed to the poisoning of our political discourse. But to imply that a woman Democratic nominee in 2020 would stop or even slow sexism (online or otherwise), when Hillary Clinton\\u2019s candidacy did nothing of the kind, strikes me as more than a little delusional.Thanks in part to the promotion of marginalized identity representation and visibility in the United States, more women and people of color have leading roles, top jobs, and other positions of power than they did a generation ago \\u2014 which, proponents argue, means positive trickle-down effects for everybody else. But any feminist or civil rights gains afforded by the efforts and visibility of, say, more women CEOs or queer politicians haven\\u2019t necessarily made significant differences in the lives of those on the margins. That isn\\u2019t to say power should stay in the hands of old, rich white guys, but that even as the pool of leaders (in everything from entertainment to publishing to politics) has grown slightly more diverse, discrimination and bigotry remain everyday facts of life for millions of Americans. Many nonwhite, nonmale people do make it a priority to raise up others when they ascend to powerful positions, but just as many others pull the ladder up behind them. Even our first black president, some black activists and thinkers have argued, fueled the false hope of a post-racial era. Critics have pointed out how Barack Obama prioritized a politics of individualized \\u201Cracial uplift\\u201D rather than one of systemic anti-racist change, and received undue celebration from pundits who preferred to overlook the less savory parts of his record \\u201Cin the name of racial symbolism,\\u201D as Cornel West wrote in 2017. Obama\\u2019s historic presidency, for all its allegorical power, did not in fact result in a post-racial America \\u2014 nor did Hillary Clinton\\u2019s candidacy solve systemic sexism or stem the tides of gendered violence. But a significant subset of progressive Democrats still cling to the hope that, going into the 2020 elections, presidential identity politics might save us. I understand the urgency undergirding so much of the push for representation and why, for example, Warren supporters are so heartened by the idea of a smart and organized woman as president, especially since she\\u2019s so often been undermined for misogynistic reasons, or why Buttigieg supporters felt passionately that his campaign was a huge symbolic win for queer rights. Both have faced real institutional barriers because of who they are, which can sometimes translate into the belief that, after so much bigoted pushback, it\\u2019s simply their turn, regardless of what either of their platforms would mean for the country. But if anything signals what should be the beginning of the end of identity as a primary metric of candidate selection in Democratic politics, it\\u2019s the rise of Sanders and his grassroots, multiracial, intergenerational movement to empower working-class people. For the Brooklyn native and many of his supporters, his identity is beside the point. If Americans elect someone who believes in universal human worth and dignity and refuses to compromise on fundamental issues, then maybe \\u2014 maybe! \\u2014 we might actually get closer to something like a \\\"post-identity\\\" reality than we could ever manage through symbolic representation.One of the latest reported instances of Sanders\\u2019 supporters running amok involved attacks against the leaders of the Nevada Culinary Workers Union after they criticized Sanders\\u2019 Medicare for All plan, because it would effectively eliminate the union\\u2019s hard-won private insurance. Buttigieg mentioned the feud in the Vegas debate, hoping to paint a picture of a Sanders coalition that viciously attacks anyone who doesn\\u2019t believe in his platform. But that storyline didn\\u2019t stop the senator from dominating the polls; in fact, members of the Culinary Workers Union themselves bucked leadership by backing Sanders in the Nevada primary, contributing to his victory there. According to the New York Times, \\u201Cmany rank-and-file union members said they supported Mr. Sanders precisely because of his health care proposal, explaining that they wanted their friends and relatives to have the same kind of access to care that they have.\\u201D This is something that seems to get overlooked in the focus on the most extreme and aggressive end of a wide spectrum of Bernie stans: Behind so many of his supporters\\u2019 vehement anger at unchecked corporate greed is a deeply compassionate impulse of solidarity with other people in this country, regardless of what they have in common and what sets them apart. And that is very much by design; as my colleague Ruby Cramer wrote in December, Sanders is aiming to run \\u201Ca presidential campaign that brings people out of alienation and into the political process simply by presenting stories where you might recognize some of your own struggles.\\u201D So it\\u2019s disorienting to watch a parade of supposed political experts and pundits scaremongering about how Sanders\\u2019 and his supporters\\u2019 rage is divisive, even as he continues to amass a strong multiracial and cross-class coalition. I don\\u2019t think someone who works for the Sanders campaign should be shitposting about opponents, even on a locked account, like former staffer Ben Mora \\u2014 if only because the senator\\u2019s critics are all too ready to pounce on an example of his movement\\u2019s supposed toxicity \\u2014 but I don\\u2019t think private insults made by a lower-rung staffer are necessarily newsworthy, either. For one thing, barely a quarter of American adults use Twitter, where a lot of the Bernie Bro hysteria is centralized. And for another, Sanders is reportedly the most-liked candidate in the Democratic field, according to a recent poll from FiveThirtyEight and Ipsos. Most voters, it seems, are comfortable making a distinction between the worst of the so-called Bernie Bros' behavior and the platform of the candidate they support. I feel similarly about the claims that Sanders is too loud, too angry, too much (which are also leveled, for sexist reasons, against Warren). In Sanders\\u2019 case, the accusations carry with them whiffs of anti-Semitism, alongside the troubling insinuation that anger is somehow an inappropriate reaction to the current state of inequality in the US. But they also reflect an attempt to position Sanders as an avatar of the patriarchy.Sady Doyle, an author and prominent figure from the mid-aughts feminist blogosphere, recently tweeted that she associated Sanders\\u2019 yelling with the horrific treatment she endured from her father growing up, and that Bernie\\u2019s movement \\u201Cenacts dynamics of abuse.\\u201D Likening Sanders, and, by extension, his supporters, to a violent misogynist becomes a frustratingly self-fulfilling prophecy; a number of cruel and vitriolic responses (which seemingly proved her point) no doubt made it easier for Doyle and others who agree with her to brush off the reasonable, good-faith criticism she also received. I\\u2019d wager Sanders\\u2019 supporters are largely aware of the debilitating effects of misogyny, if not experiencing it firsthand. But what overly simplistic readings like \\u201CBernie = Man = Bad\\u201D elide is the many complicated ways in which different kinds of people experience gendered violence. Since time immemorial women have terrorized black people of all genders; cis people have terrorized trans people of all genders; the combinations go on and on. Those who feel triggered by the tenor and volume of Sanders\\u2019 voice \\u2014 to the extent that they\\u2019d seriously struggle to vote for him over Donald Trump \\u2014 resonate on the same frequency, to me, as women who\\u2019ve experienced male violence and thus refuse to share space with trans women. That\\u2019s not to say their trauma is negligible or excusable, but that projecting individual trauma onto entire communities or movements, made up as they are of an incredibly diverse array of humans, does a disservice to us all. Earlier this year, some similar projection occurred when the question of whether Sanders had privately expressed doubts to Warren that a woman could win the presidency became the topic of public debate. As Natalie Shure wrote for Elle at the time, \\u201Cthe impulse to cast Sanders and his supporters as sexist \\u2014 intended as a sharp contrast with the feminists behind Warren or Hillary Clinton before her \\u2014 is based on an analysis of politics as a pop cultural product. In this telling, Warren is the beleaguered underdog heroine, taking on just another old white guy finger-wagging his way to the top. This obfuscates the structural power at work and the degree to which many people are drawn to Sanders\\u2019 candidacy for decidedly feminist reasons: In a starkly unequal country with a woefully inadequate welfare state, women disproportionately suffer the harms of poverty.\\u201D Ultimately, Shure wrote, \\u201C#MeToo doesn\\u2019t urge us to uncritically accept a female presidential contender\\u2019s version of a news story; it urges us to take seriously women\\u2019s pain and fight for them to have control over their lives \\u2014 and no one, least of all victims of sexual violence, is served by collapsing that moral distinction.\\u201DTo some extent, it\\u2019s understandable why Sanders makes such a tempting blank canvas for projecting identity narratives, since the candidate largely refuses to narrativize his identity himself. He doesn\\u2019t talk much, for example, about the fact that, if elected, he would be the first Jewish president in US history, though he\\u2019s done so more this election cycle than he did back in 2016. (He\\u2019s also recently been referring to himself as the \\u201Cson of an immigrant.\\u201D) That\\u2019s one of the reasons his recent remarks at a New Hampshire town hall about how his Jewish heritage influences his politics and worldview struck such a chord; a clip of the exchange has been viewed over 1.5 million times. While other candidates like Warren and Biden \\u201Coften invite you to consider your story through the lens of their own,\\u201D as Cramer wrote in her profile of Sanders late last year, the Vermont senator would rather not use his personal life to connect with voters. \\u201CYou\\u2019re asking about me, and I\\u2019M not important,\\u201D he once said in an interview. To Cramer, he added, \\u201CThe gamble is there are millions of working people who don\\u2019t vote or consider politics to be relevant to their lives. And it is a gamble to see whether we can bring those people into the political process. One way you do it is to say, \\u2018You see that guy? He\\u2019s YOU. You\\u2019re workin\\u2019 for $12 an hour, you can\\u2019t afford health insurance \\u2014 so is he. Listen to what he has to say. It\\u2019s not Bernie Sanders talking, you know? It\\u2019s that guy. Join us.\\u2019\\u201D To his supporters, Sanders\\u2019 refusal to center himself in his campaign makes it clear that he views himself as a mere vessel for a movement that\\u2019s much bigger than one person or one presidency. In many ways, the campaign does traffic in more conventional identity narratives \\u2014 the focus is just on other people\\u2019s identities: those of his campaign staffers and those of potential voting blocs. Surrogates like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez can speak to Sanders\\u2019 platform as it\\u2019s relevant to different minority communities with personal and cultural specificity, while black campaign leaders like Briahna Joy Gray and Nina Turner emphasize how much of Sanders\\u2019 movement is actually shaped by, and for, black women. Sanders himself is well aware that, on the level of optics, he himself is not an ideal messenger. (At a recent CNN town hall, when asked about a VP pick, he said, \\u201CThat person will not be an old white guy. That I can say definitively.\\u201D) And so the campaign emphasizes the senator\\u2019s history of movement ties and support \\u2014 the people are leading him, rather than the other way around. Were he to become president, Sanders has said he would be acting as \\u201Corganizer in chief.\\u201D In some ways, of course, Sanders\\u2019 universalism with a focus on labor isn\\u2019t anything new; every successful presidential candidate has sold the American people on some broader vision, from Obama on hope to Trump on making America great again. And it\\u2019s hard to believe anyone vying to become one of the most powerful people on earth when they tell us it\\u2019s not really about them. And yet, with the slogan \\u201CNot Me, Us\\u201D (an active rhetorical reversal of Hillary Clinton\\u2019s \\u201CI\\u2019m With Her\\u201D) Sanders has fashioned a campaign built and backed by people of all genders, races, and socioeconomic classes who don\\u2019t necessarily see themselves in him as an individual \\u2014 perhaps because they don\\u2019t really need to. Even though former vice president Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are old white guys, for example, the former\\u2019s overwhelming black support in South Carolina won him his first primary in that state over the weekend; meanwhile, a recent poll shows that the latter has just overtaken Biden in support among African Americans nationally. Of course, at this point, voters are selecting from an all-white field \\u2014 but even earlier in the race, black voters weren\\u2019t necessarily flocking to support black candidates.I think often in this never-ending election cycle of Zoe Leonard\\u2019s landmark poem, \\u201CI Want a President,\\u201D written the year I was born. \\u201CI want a dyke for president,\\u201D Leonard writes. \\u201CI want a person with aids for president and I want a fag for vice president and I want someone with no health insurance and I want someone who grew up in a place where the earth is so saturated with toxic waste that they didn\\u2019t have a choice about getting leukemia.\\u201D No matter how many times I read it, the poem can still leave me teary-eyed; it\\u2019s weighted with so much crushing impossibility. Because even if we one day do have a \\u201Cdyke\\u201D or a \\u201Cfag\\u201D for president \\u2014 or a woman, for that matter \\u2014 it seems impossible that we\\u2019ll ever see someone in the White House who truly represents people currently living beneath the poverty line. There have been presidents who grew up in economically precarious situations, and Sanders could potentially join their ranks, but even the sole democratic socialist candidate had to first become a millionaire in order to make it this far. That\\u2019s the strange thing about class. It\\u2019s possible to live your whole life in the same socioeconomic bracket \\u2014 indeed, as the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, class ascendance is becoming a rarer feat \\u2014 but it\\u2019s also possible to slip into and out of poverty. Like disability, class isn\\u2019t as stable an identity as those of race or gender (though race and gender aren\\u2019t necessarily stable either). And like sexual orientation, it\\u2019s not always possible to look at someone and determine their family\\u2019s present or past household income \\u2014 which is one of the reasons why, when discussing identity in US politics, Sanders is so rarely given representation credit for his ability to speak to people who also know what it\\u2019s like to live paycheck to paycheck. What\\u2019s remarkable about the senator\\u2019s campaign is that he drives home the fact almost all of us, save the very rich, are a single medical issue away from complete financial ruin. For all our many differences, this is a grisly reality the working people of this country have in common. Though conservatives and moderates who fear the rise of democratic socialism love to try gotcha-ing Sanders for his \\u201Chypocrisy\\u201D because he owns a lake house, or target his surrogate Ocasio-Cortez when she wears sparkly tops or gets an expensive haircut, the fact that some people have more disposable income doesn\\u2019t preclude them from advocating for a fairer distribution for all. And those of us who\\u2019ve managed, against the odds, to ascend from the working poor to the middle class are not under any illusions that being able to buy a nice dress today means we\\u2019ll never again have to fear losing our jobs and therefore our health care tomorrow.Voters who are more progressively minded but still think Sanders\\u2019 focus on class is too singular tend to worry his campaign isn\\u2019t \\u201Cintersectional\\u201D enough, especially when compared with Warren\\u2019s. Last month, the Nation published an opinion piece (since corrected and updated) by professor Suzanna Danuta Walters claiming that Warren is the \\u201Cfirst intersectional presidential candidate.\\u201D The story includes as examples of Warren\\u2019s \\u201Cintersectional framework\\u201D her ability to link gun control to domestic violence, or criminal justice to disability rights. But she\\u2019s not the only candidate who can lay claim to a platform that concerns multiple intersecting identities and oppressions. Sanders\\u2019 plan for a Green New Deal, for example, prioritizes \\u201CJustice for frontline communities \\u2014 especially under-resourced groups, communities of color, Native Americans, people with disabilities, children and the elderly \\u2014 to recover from, and prepare for, the climate impacts.\\u201D And if some people are claiming Sanders can't serve the interests of multiple different identity groups or communities he doesn't belong to, a lot of the people in those communities beg to differ. Barbara Smith \\u2014 who along with other members of the black women\\u2013helmed Combahee River Collective coined the term \\u201Cidentity politics\\u201D \\u2014 expressed dismay earlier this year in the Guardian that she so often sees \\u201Csupport for identity politics and intersectionality reduced to buzzwords.\\u201D Smith was writing to endorse Sanders for president: \\u201Cbecause I believe that his campaign and his understanding of politics complements the priorities that women of color defined decades ago.\\u201D Smith directly addresses the intersectionality concern: \\u201CSome critics have questioned whether Sanders is concerned about the specific ways that people with varying intersecting identities experience oppression. As a black lesbian feminist who has been out since the mid-1970s, I believe that, among all the candidates, his leadership offers us the best chance to eradicate the unique injustices that marginalized groups in America endure.\\u201D Critic Andrea Long Chu, in response to the Nation\\u2019s piece about Warren\\u2019s supposed intersectionality, nailed in a Twitter thread what\\u2019s so frustrating about assumptions that Sanders isn\\u2019t as strong on issues of race and gender: The piece, she wrote, is \\u201Cv specific to academic feminists who have so convinced themselves that universalism is a luxury of the elite that when a candidate amasses a broad working class coalition with universal rhetoric their brains pop. \\u2026 like do i think bernie sanders really knows what a trans person is? no. nor for that matter does liz warren. but trans people need health care way more than they need some politician to give them a nice vibe. \\u2026 there\\u2019s real humility to universalism insofar as it doesn\\u2019t predicate public goods on visibility or representation. Bernie doesn\\u2019t have to \\u2018see\\u2019 you in order to defend you. it\\u2019s impersonal in a way i find respectful.\\u201D Where critics of Sanders find evidence of potential erasure in his universalist appeals \\u2014 that any moment he discusses the working class in general is a moment when he\\u2019s not specifically addressing the concerns of black women or mothers or trans people \\u2014 his supporters see a radical and widespread commitment to economic justice regardless of who they are.All of this is not to say identity can\\u2019t, or shouldn\\u2019t, play any role in an individual politician\\u2019s narrative. Sanders, even if his personal life remains his campaign\\u2019s B plot at best, still has the power to connect with voters by speaking to his Jewish identity and his upbringing in a rent-controlled Brooklyn apartment. Ocasio-Cortez, too, has made a powerful case for issues she cares about, like a $15 minimum wage, by couching political discussions in her experience as a waiter and a member of the working class. And Warren, in the last two primary debates, has proven to be a formidable Bloomberg opponent by brilliantly connecting her own ordeals of discrimination in the workplace to the indignities allegedly suffered by women under Bloomberg\\u2019s employ. She pushed him to release three women from their NDAs in a matter of days. Warren quoting on national TV the horrible things Bloomberg has reportedly said about women made a very strong case for electing someone who intimately understands what it feels like to be harassed, belittled, and violated due to one\\u2019s gender.But Warren\\u2019s candidacy has also shown us the downsides to an overreliance on identity narratives. More than 200 Cherokees and other Native Americans just signed a letter urging Warren to fully retract her dubious past claims to Native heritage, including her reliance on a DNA test that she publicized last year. Warren has previously apologized, and recently reiterated those apologies in a 12-page letter, but the claims continue to haunt her. Neither is relying on the identity of high-powered surrogates a safe bet; the New York Times, in a recent story about how Warren is winning black activists but losing the black vote, Astead W. Herndon reported that \\u201Cthe progressive activists who have showered her candidacy with validation have a different electoral lens than the black electorate at large. That schism is a distinction some have labeled \\u2018grass tops vs. the grass roots\\u2019 \\u2014 or the belief that the leaders of liberal and progressive organizations have a different political lens than their more working-class members.\\u201D Which is all to say that attempts to politicize the personal can just as often be a liability as they are an advantage \\u2014 a risky game that Sanders, in his refusal to frame his campaign around his identity, has largely decided not to play. As a straight white man, even a socialist Jewish one, that\\u2019s without a doubt in part a function of his privilege. Most nonwhite, nonmale candidates don\\u2019t have the option of making a campaign Not All About Them. Sanders \\u2014 for all that the Democratic establishment might be doing to try to prevent him from clinching the nomination \\u2014 does benefit from looking like the \\u201Cdefault\\u201D political candidate in a way a black person or a woman simply doesn\\u2019t. But if you have a built-in strategic advantage in building this kind of universalist campaign, you might as well use it. Earlier this year, the publishing world\\u2019s equivalent of the identity politics debate centered on the novel American Dirt, about a mother and her son fleeing violence in Mexico for the promise of the US. The book, which was criticized for its harmful stereotypes of Latinx immigrants, was written by a woman who until recently identified as white. In a Twitter thread in the wake of the controversy, writer Kaitlyn Greenidge posed an excellent question: \\u201CWhat if the aim of your art is not to humanize the other but to talk about the systems of power, and the ppl who benefit from them, that turn people into others in the first place? Like what if you asked your audience to take it for granted that someone poorer than them is also human and then moved on from there.\\u201D I wonder if Sanders\\u2019 campaign might be employing something similar: taking for granted the fact that all of us, regardless of our race or gender or socioeconomic status, are human, and therefore deserving of certain rights: clean water, a roof over our heads, freedom from crippling college debt, medical care that won\\u2019t sink us into bankruptcy. Sanders, like any politician, is not a saint or a savior. To many of those who harbor serious doubts about the fundamental value of electoral politics and the structures that govern our society, a vote for him at the end of the day is still harm reduction, still a way in which we are choosing our enemy. And universalism, at its most basic level, is the biggest cliché in the political handbook: We are all more alike than we are different. But anyone still clinging to the hope of identity representation might do well to remember that. ●"},{"author":"Amanda Litman","title":"What To Do If You Hate The Democratic Nominee","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/amandalitman\/what-to-do-if-youre-democrat-who-hates-the-nominee","content":"After the 2016 election, you promised yourself you\\u2019d do everything you can to beat Trump in 2020. You marched and protested, knocked doors in the midterms, wrote postcards to voters, donated to anyone whose video caught your eye, and maybe even got caught up in some ridiculous social media squabbles. Now the time has finally come. The 2020 election is here, and the Democratic primary is very slowly narrowing, with only a handful of candidates remaining. You\\u2019ve been preparing for this for three years, and yet: When you look at the possibilities, you\\u2019re deflated. Or maybe you feel it more viscerally: You cannot stomach the idea of casting a ballot for ______, let alone knocking a door for them or giving them money. You know you have a moral responsibility to act, but there is simply no way you can do it on behalf of ________. Don\\u2019t worry. There is another, equally important, way to make a difference this November that won\\u2019t require you to fake it through a canvassing shift: Go local. With your time, money, attention, and most importantly, your vote, you can help beat Trump and build sustainable power for Democrats without ever saying the Democratic nominee\\u2019s name. First, here\\u2019s what to do with your time: Within an hour\\u2019s drive of nearly every zip code in America, there is an election where a Democrat \\u2014 one who\\u2019s not running for president \\u2014 needs your help. If you live in or near a state like Alabama, Georgia, Maine, Montana, Texas, North Carolina, or Iowa, that election might be huge, like a Senate race. Maybe it\\u2019s a high-stakes governor\\u2019s race, like in Missouri, North Carolina, West Virginia, or New Hampshire. More critically, in all 50 states, there are down-ballot elections, ranging from must-win Statehouse and Senate elections to district attorneys, school board, county clerks, tax collector, judges, justices of the peace, and library boards (to name just a few of the many positions that might be on your ballot). And too often, folks who do show up at the polls fail to cast their votes for positions outside the top two or three, in part because they feel they don\\u2019t know enough to make a choice. Go knock doors for those state and local candidates. Your energy will yield dividends \\u2014 because the voter contact you do will make a difference for the entire ticket: young people and communities of color, especially, who often feel dismissed or ignored by national candidates, can be more directly energized by local issues and candidates. And at the end of the day, it doesn\\u2019t really matter which Democratic campaign gets someone to the polls as long as they get there. Even if the candidate you support loses, the campaign itself strengthens party infrastructure for the next cycle. If the candidate wins, even better: A Democrat is now in office who can govern, deliver on their promises, and help prevent the GOP from causing further harm. Second, here\\u2019s what to do with your money: It\\u2019s possible that the Democratic nominee will be someone to whom you flat-out refuse to make a donation. It\\u2019s also possible that the Democratic nominee is someone who doesn\\u2019t want your money in the first place. Either way, forget about them. No matter who the nominee is, there will be literally billions of dollars spent on their behalf, probably focused in a handful of battleground states. Meanwhile, candidates for city council and statehouses are going to be struggling to pay for basic things they desperately need as they knock thousands of doors and personally talk to voters. Take whatever money you\\u2019d budgeted for beating Trump, and split it in down the middle. Give half of it to local candidates who catch your eye. Give the other half to an organization (or a few) that will exist past Election Day 2020. Focus on groups that work with local candidates \\u2014 we humbly suggest our own group, Run for Something, of course, but any will do \\u2014 or groups that engage young people and\\\/or communities of color. Give to organizations that do deep relationship-building in states that a presidential campaign is never going to organize in because the Electoral College doesn\\u2019t incentivize it. If you can afford to, make your donation recurring and plan to let it run into 2021. Third, here\\u2019s what to do with your attention if you hate the eventual nominee: Commit to amplifying local candidates on every social media network you\\u2019re active on. You can mute the presidential nominee\\u2019s name on Twitter if you want, or unfollow them on Instagram and Facebook; replace them with a local news source (if there still is one in your community) and with every candidate who will be on your ballot in November, and any ballot referendums, too. Then go wild with the retweet and share buttons. You might be the only one in your circle of friends who cares about these elections. Be the trendsetter who gets others fired up. And finally, here\\u2019s what to do with your vote: Whether you vote is public, but whom you vote for is private. It\\u2019s your right to cast your ballot for whomever you prefer. But especially if you\\u2019re a person with any kind of privilege, you have a responsibility to think beyond your self-interest. This election is about the most vulnerable among us who need you to be an ally. While it might be tempting to take a principled stand and not vote, the facts are what they are: The general election will be between Trump and the eventual Democratic nominee. You don\\u2019t get to go off menu. The people who will be most harmed by your failure to vote against Trump are people who are already seriously hurting \\u2014 that is a responsibility to take seriously, especially if you live in one of the battleground states where the margin could be dangerously close. That being said: Whatever you decide to do in the presidential election, make sure you vote for the rest of the ballot. It is all too common for folks to show up at the polls, check the boxes for the first race or two, and then just turn it in unfinished, often because they feel like they don\\u2019t know enough to make an informed decision. That\\u2019s why the doors you knock, articles you share, and money you donate all matter. By directing your efforts to state and local elections, you\\u2019ll help beat Trump, build sustainable power for Democrats, and, perhaps most importantly, start to feel good about politics again. Your rage for the Democratic nominee might dissipate, or it might not. (And if you love the eventual Democratic nominee, great! By helping local candidates, you\\u2019ll ensure that our Democratic president will have governing partners, so all the policies we\\u2019ve spent the last year debating can actually become reality.) Either way, you\\u2019ll know you did everything you could. No matter the results, you can wake up the day after Election Day 2020 without regrets. Amanda Litman and Ross Morales Rocketto are the cofounders of Run for Something.

While Matthews has since apologized, it was an astounding and unconscionable moment: one of the country\\u2019s most prominent political commentators disparaging the campaign of a man who could very well be America\\u2019s first Jewish president. And it revealed something powerful. A few hours earlier, one of America\\u2019s most celebrated Democratic strategists, James Carville, went on air to say the winners in Nevada were Sanders and Vladimir Putin. As I watched, I realized these weren\\u2019t just random or offhand comments; they\\u2019re the last gasp of a political elite that\\u2019s been radically out of touch with the lives of normal people for most of the 21st century, increasingly inept at explaining the enormous pain and discontent felt by the working- and middle-class voters who make up the base of the Democratic Party. To put it another way, a generational transition is happening in the Democratic Party \\u2014 and it\\u2019s clear that many of its current leaders and talking heads don\\u2019t understand why. From my perspective, the reason a party stalwart representing the last half-century of Democratic politics is losing to an independent, anti-establishment outsider is pretty straightforward. After all, millions of Americans are suffering from the consequences of a generation\\u2019s worth of bad decisions made by the political establishment, both Democratic and Republican. The communities torn apart by deportations, those jailed by the rise of mass incarceration, the families reeling from the toll of the war in Iraq, young people trying to live their lives under the yoke of crushing student debt, and everyone suffering from skyrocketing inequality after the financial crisis now simply understand that these crises required the willing complicity of leaders in both parties, including even prominent Democrats like Joe Biden. The actual problems facing Americans have gotten really bad, and people rightly blame consultants and elected officials, both Democrats and Republicans, for bringing our society to the brink. Simply put, this is why people are drawn to Bernie. They\\u2019re looking for new leaders who either didn\\u2019t contribute to those crises or \\u2014 even better \\u2014 have spent their entire careers opposing the policies that led to them. They are looking for leaders whose solutions actually scale up to the problems facing our society, because they understand there\\u2019s an entire generation of politicians who were on the wrong side of some of the defining fights of our lives, and Joe Biden embodies them. And yet, it\\u2019s clear that few of the people you see discussing politics on cable TV understand that. They insist Biden\\u2019s poor showing has been the fault of lackluster debate performances. Just as they failed to understand Trump\\u2019s rise, they fail to see that their theories have been discredited. And they\\u2019ve all but called Democratic voters stupid, because these talking heads are unable to grapple with the obvious: Sanders is winning by speaking to the hopes and fears of a rising generation of Democrats who look and think a lot more like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez than Joe Biden. There are signs of hope, however. Progressives like Alexandra Rojas and Abdul El-Sayed are now providing commentary at CNN that raises the level of discussion to a much higher level. Yvette Simpson is often sparring with Rahm Emanuel and Chris Christie at ABC News. And Anand Giridharadas has been holding his own network accountable and it sounds like the message is being heard. But the shift is happening at a glacial pace, and in the meantime, cable TV keeps on embarrassing itself on a daily basis. The reason is simple: the lives of many of its talking heads are totally divorced from the enormous pain of having an unaffordable medical bill, or $200,000 in student loan debt, or not having even $500 in the bank. Many in my generation see this clearly. We are diverse, worse off than our parents, and came of age during the Iraq War and the financial crisis. We understand the existential threat of the climate crisis, and see an authoritarian right-wing government that wants to suppress multiracial democracy at every turn. The Republican Party, despite having won the popular vote only once in my lifetime, nevertheless controls the Presidency, the Senate and the Supreme Court. And top scientists at the UN tell us we have about 10 years to act in order to stave off ecological collapse. To us, things look and feel deeply, deeply broken, which is why a political revolution seems a more pragmatic and necessary vehicle for hope than Biden\\u2019s prediction of a post-Trump epiphany among Republicans. On an even deeper level, my generation, despite being plugged in and connected, feels deeply alone. The movements we built under Obama \\u2014 Occupy Wall Street, a network of immigrant DREAMers, the climate movement, Black Lives Matter \\u2014 have been fueled in part by a deep desire to find community and identity in a country that is increasingly unable to respond to our aspirations and tells us that we must fend for ourselves. Sanders, on some deep level, has given voice to these individual movements by linking them together into a song of solidarity: \\u201CAre you willing to fight for someone you don't know?\\u201D Amid such a compelling offer, the smug and empty \\u201Cliberalism\\u201D of the supposedly serious people in charge finds itself unmoored, bereft of ideas to solve our many crises. Sanders\\u2019 big idea is to return the Democratic Party to its roots in the powerful labor and civil rights movements of the mid-20th century. The universal social programs Bernie Sanders is fighting for are not radical \\u2014 they\\u2019re commonsense and cost-effective ways to provide the basic things we all need to thrive. In most European countries, his agenda would belong in a center-right party. It\\u2019s why Democrats haven\\u2019t been convinced by the yearslong fear-mongering about his candidacy. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says: \\u201CWe aren\\u2019t pushing the party left, we are bringing the party home.\\u201D My mother is a union member who experienced the cruelty of navigating our byzantine health care system after suffering a stroke three years ago. My dad is angry watching my two younger siblings suffer from a mountain of student debt while they try to catch up with soaring rents. They\\u2019ve lived in this country for decades and feel under attack by this president and the racism he\\u2019s encouraged among our citizens. The first time they ever voted was for Barack Obama, because he gave them hope. This time, like many of the immigrant and working-class voters of Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, both of my parents are supporting Bernie Sanders. The TV pundits and wealthy consultants can\\u2019t explain it. But it\\u2019s because they feel someone finally understands their struggles and is willing to fight those who created those problems in the first place. It\\u2019s hope and change they can believe in.

But what about the teens? Young people are going to be the ones living with the consequences of what happens in the 2020 election. Many of them don't have the right to vote, but they should be heard \\u2014 so we asked 11 teenagers from across the country to watch the debate last night and let us know what they thought. Here's what they had to say, edited for length and clarity. Malavika Kannan, 19 Stanford University @malavikawritesOverall: The debate put us in the surreal position of watching seven white candidates grapple, collide, and dance around the issue of race. While the Democratic victor is guaranteed to be white, the losers of this debate were undeniably people of color. It was amusing at best, and maddening at worst, to see white men like Biden, Buttigieg, and Bloomberg vying to raise their hands and point fingers at one another about past policies that harmed people of color. Tom Steyer, in one of his few relevant utterances of the night, announced that everything operated under the \\u201Cgiant subtext of race,\\u201D and he was right. I liked: Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar were refreshingly cogent debaters. Perhaps both women were at an inherent disadvantage in a debate that required candidates to yell, interrupt, and take up space \\u2014 despite their convincing performances, the women senators struggled to make anything stick. The candidates I was least impressed by: Nobody seemed to break through the white noise or offer anything new. Bernie Sanders, perhaps comfortable in his frontrunner status, made characteristically little effort to appeal to new voters outside of his usual discourse. Meanwhile, Buttigieg, Biden, and Bloomberg felt like progressively more out-of-touch versions of one another, like a series of those Snapchat filters that show you how you\\u2019ll age.Satchel Walton, 16 DuPont Manual High School, Louisville, KentuckyWhat was missing: Neither the environment nor climate change was mentioned by the moderators. Not once. It got a few mentions from Sanders, Steyer, and Buttigieg, and the issue has been briefly discussed in previous debates, but it is frankly absurd that the issues that will be the biggest threats to our way of life in the 21st century weren\\u2019t debated. I\\u2019m still waiting for the pointed question to the candidates who oppose nuclear power, or a question to all candidates about how they will fight the powerful fossil fuel lobbies or convince world leaders to come along with them, or any question about one of the myriad of environmental issues other than climate change, such as mountaintop removal, access to drinkable water, or the pollution of waterways, land, and air. The moment I\\u2019ll remember: Biden\\u2019s certitude that \\u201CI will win South Carolina.\\u201D He said he\\u2019d win. Then the moderators asked him what would happen if he didn\\u2019t. He said he would win. Asked again in the spin room, he said he would win South Carolina. If Saturday\\u2019s results roll in and Biden doesn\\u2019t win, it will be clear that he\\u2019s done. What I didn\\u2019t like: It is frustrating that at each debate candidates come with studies or articles that factually contradict each other but the moderators and news media can\\u2019t tell us who is correct. Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden bickered about who wrote a particular bill. Was it Klobuchar or Biden? I don\\u2019t know! They both claimed to have written it, and it\\u2019s a simple and knowable fact. But the moderators didn\\u2019t say. The \\u201CHow much will Medicare for All cost?\\u201D debate happens at every single debate. Yet we still haven\\u2019t clarified if it would save money or if Sanders\\u2019 plans would annually cost three times as much as the American GDP. I just want one good article from an unbiased, credible source showing what the different studies the candidates are citing actually show about the facts behind the claims. Irene Franco Rubio, 20 Arizona State University @IFrancoRubioWhat was missing: Children are still being separated from their families, but immigration reform was not even touched upon. Climate change was only mentioned when foreign affairs was brought into question, though it was not of the utmost importance. As a young Latinx person, both of these issues are of top priority considering my community in Phoenix is especially impacted when it comes to immigration and the future of this planet is at stake. Bernie and Warren\\u2019s campaigns are committed to inspiring people who do not normally participate in democracy to show up at the polls this election year. But what is it all worth if these new or reintegrated voters are being targeted by voter suppression tactics in states across the nation? Democrats should be talking about the relevance and presence of voter suppression. I was least impressed by: Bloomberg. He is a billionaire with an obvious personal agenda. His stop-and-frisk policy in New York was a form of racial profiling and an evidently racist tactic that was intended to oppress people of color. This reminded me of SB1070 in Arizona, an anti-immigration bill that allowed law enforcement officials to racially profile within predominately Latinx and immigrant communities.Sophia Kianni, 17 Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology @sophiakianniI liked: Bernie Sanders \\u2014 he had answers prepared and, considering the fire he was faced with, responded relatively well. Linking his comments to Obama\\u2019s was smart. He also pointed out that 47 out of 50 polls have shown him beating Donald Trump, debunking claims he would be unable to do so. Joe Biden also had a surprisingly solid night, and his choice to be polite and avoid butting in made him look more levelheaded than his counterparts. I didn\\u2019t like: Pete Buttigieg looked desperate to get speaking time, and he interrupted Sanders and other candidates at every possible moment he could. He came off as arrogant and rude. How did the moderators allow him to sing praises about black voters without asking about his nonexistent minority support? I was also unsettled by Michael Bloomberg\\u2019s comment that he \\u201Cbought\\u201D Democrats their seats in Congress. My favorite moment: Elizabeth Warren taking on Michael Bloomberg, talking about how he poured money into her Republican opponent! It was an incredibly effective way to demonstrate how recently he has changed his positions \\u2014 including his view on stop-and-frisk \\u2014 to become a \\u201CDemocrat.\\u201D What was missing: The fact that Bloomberg was asked about his choice to ban trans fats in New York City but there was no time to ask about climate change is deeply concerning and appalling. And why were candidates asked about North Korea and China but not India?! They should have discussed Trump\\u2019s support of Modi, despite the Indian leader\\u2019s persecution of Muslims. Ryan Pascal, 17 High school student, Los Angeles @ryanapascalI liked: Elizabeth Warren impressed me the most. While her (mostly male) opponents shouted and interrupted each other, she remained calm and collected. It\\u2019s important to note that the candidates around her who blew up were male because I believe that had she acted the same way as a woman, people would view her as unfit, unhinged, and emotional. A moment I\\u2019ll remember: When the candidates discussed gun safety. It\\u2019s an issue that I am very passionate about, along with millions of other Americans \\u2014 particularly, young people. The topic got a substantial amount of time and each of the candidates made strong points. Even Pete Buttigieg made a poignant statement, saying older politicians\\u2019 inaction on gun safety legislation helped usher in a new \\u201Cschool shooting\\u201D generation. His point that he was a high schooler during Columbine resonated with me, as a high schooler who sees the impact of gun violence. The fact that someone from the Columbine generation is now old enough to run for president puts the gravity of the crisis into perspective. What was missing: I wish the candidates had spent more time discussing climate change. Tom Steyer tried to inject a comment or two concerning the topic, but there was no serious examination. Allyson Smith, 19 Howard University, Washington, DC @allyn.smith \\\/ @senpaiversesOverall: I will be honest: No one impressed me. It was a very hostile, unsecure space in which personal jabs stood in for the answering of serious questions. I feel as though this debate really showed me the state of the Democratic Party in terms of individualism. The only two candidates that showed comradery were Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. It was a very disappointing night. What was missing: Reparations. Although much of the debate was mostly spent on tackling the Black vote, I feel like the candidates should have spent more time on this topic due to the variances of platforms and ways in which this could be implemented. As of now, Elizabeth Warren is the only candidate actively trying to incentivize HBCUs \\u2014 why aren\\u2019t we talking more about this?! She\\u2019s not a perfect candidate by any means, but this does make me eager to see her plan of execution on this matter. Everyone is trying to secure the Black vote, but who is trying to actually assist blackness? Final thoughts: This debate was PURE chaos. Literally a HOT-ASS mess, and it solved nothing nor gave me any insight about the platforms or issues these candidates are trying to address. Billy Mykel, 16 Argyle High School, Sanger, Texas @mykelbilly My favorite moment: Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s attack on Bernie Sanders\\u2019 ability to beat President Trump among moderate voters and how people in swing districts would flee from the senator\\u2019s far-left policies. Buttigieg\\u2019s allusion to President Trump being reelected and the House being lost due to divisions in the Democratic Party spoke to what really is the center issue of this debate and election in my mind: Just how progressive is the future of the party? I was also impressed with former vice president Joe Biden\\u2019s performance compared to previous debates. He was able to steer the conversation in his favor several times. His comparison between Sanders\\u2019 voting record and the Big Pharma and tobacco lobbyists was especially powerful. What was missing: I wish the topic of student loans was addressed more in tonight's debate. While it was brought up by individual candidates during the discussion of education, I wish I could have heard more of their opinions on the issue and more solutions to it. I also wish that the conversation about education went into student mental health, which is something that affects many people across the nation and was only mentioned once during the whole night. These two issues are a serious concern to the nation\\u2019s youth and are a major cause of many of the systemic issues we see with poverty, depression, anxiety, and suicide in the US.Zyahna Bryant, 19 University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia @ZyahnaBWhat I liked: I was surprised by Tom Steyer\\u2019s call for reparations. It is important to mention the fact that there are no people of color remaining in the race. Because of this, in many of the racial justice\\u2013focused conversations that would perhaps center reparations for Black people, the topic is often left out of the discourse. If I had to make a prediction of who I thought would bring that up, I am not sure that Steyer would have been my guess. What I didn\\u2019t like: I am continually confused about why Pete Buttigieg remains on the stage and in the race. He sometimes has insightful points, but overall he does not appear to have much of a real vision or blueprint for the future of the country. I am also very unimpressed by Amy Klobuchar. Again, not completely sure why she is still in the race. And I really didn\\u2019t like when Joe Biden claimed to have a grasp on the Black vote in South Carolina. I think his relevance and association with this idea of electability is bound up in the proximity he has to Obama \\u2014 and the nostalgia\\\/memory of the Obama presidency among southern Black voters. Biden continues to sell himself as Obama 2.0 and I am hopeful that voters in South Carolina see through it. What was missing: I think that this debate was very messy. There was quite a focus on shade and reads between candidates, but in order to beat someone like Trump, I do think that we are going to need to hear more policy. This is a good time to showcase platform pieces in a strategic way and reach the audience who may be on the fence. I need to see more of that. Emily Bach, 16 Oakton High School, Oakton, Virginia @emilyjeanbachOverall: The moderating of this debate made it difficult to differentiate winners from losers. A combination of poor rules enforcement, frequent interjections, and cross-talk created messy conversations with messier implications for viewers. My favorite moment: Bernie Sanders\\u2019 answer on the Israel\\u2013Palestine issue, specifically in response to concerns among parts of the Jewish electorate, exhibited a lot of political courage. Calling Benjamin Netanyahu a \\u201Creactionary racist\\u201D is easily the most radical position adopted by the candidates on the stage, and one that could pay off for Sanders among pro-Palestine supporters. His answer \\u2014 coupled with his critiques of the interventions in Iran, Guatemala, and Chile \\u2014 indicate the ways in which a Sanders presidency could be incredibly consequential in terms of foreign policy and drastically reshape the face of American military influence abroad. What was missing: I hoped that the candidates would spend more time addressing the #MeToo movement, particularly in light of Harvey Weinstein\\u2019s recent guilty verdict. South Carolina has some of the most regressive sexual education policies in the US, a key indicator of the likeliness of sexual assault, making the state a unique stakeholder in the fight against sexual violence. This could have easily been incorporated into conversations about education or Bloomberg\\u2019s NDAs. While some candidates were close to discussing the issue, they ultimately missed the mark.Kennedi Casey, 17 Martinsville High School, Martinsville, Indiana @ken_noellWho I liked: My favorites were Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, and Bernie Sanders. All three were very straightforward as to what they expect or want to accomplish if they win the presidency. I give props to Klobuchar for putting herself out there during the debate. Throughout the election process, I have not heard much from or about her, but last night I feel as if she really pushed forward to be able to get herself heard. Who I didn\\u2019t like: Michael Bloomberg. I feel as if he is only running for office since he has the money to do so. My favorite moment: When the moderator asked what proof Warren had regarding the allegation that Bloomberg had told one of his former employers to abort her child, and Warren answered, \\u201CHer words.\\u201D I admire this, since women are more likely than men to be told that their words are not the truth. Warren wanted to make it shown that she will listen to people and believe them when they talk about things that they have experienced. Overall: I feel as if this debate was informative, but also complete and utter chaos. I understand that debates are intense and everyone wants to share their opinions, but I want them to also express human decency.Marcelo Villar-Ojito, 16 High school student, Miami @marcelo_voWho I liked: It was tough to discern who was actually making a good point and who was just shouting louder than the other people on the stage. However, Elizabeth Warren showed some restraint. Throughout the debate, there were many interruptions during designated speaking times, but Warren held her tongue more than everyone else. Her responses and attacks, while charged, were backed by evidence and statistics. It\\u2019s always good to see a politician use facts. What was missing: The debate didn\\u2019t focus enough on education costs. Many candidates on the stage have conflicting public stances on college tuition, but once again it wasn\\u2019t clear how they plan to pull off their different proposals. It\\u2019s customary for a presidential candidate to promise a slew of things on the campaign trail, but as seen from previous years and past presidents, only so much can be done once in office, even with a clear path. Without a clearly articulated plan, it\\u2019s difficult to know what to expect. I\\u2019m sure they have ideas on how they want to achieve lower tuition; I just want to understand them.

Wade, 47 years after the case was decided. I had just started working my first job with a decent salary and benefits in 2015 when I discovered I was pregnant. When I told my boyfriend, he apologized and said he needed to focus on his future, and this would mess that up. He offered to send money to compensate me. I made two decisions after that. First, if I was to go through with this pregnancy, I would do it on my own. Then I thought about my future and what the best choice was for me. That's when I made my second decision. I decided to get an abortion. In Louisiana, that\\u2019s easier said than done. First, I wasted three weeks going back and forth, an hour each way, to what I believed was a health center that could help me get an abortion. It turned out to be an anti-abortion crisis pregnancy center \\u2014 one of more than 2,500 across the country, multiplying while abortion providers are being regulated out of existence. There, I was asked deeply personal questions, made to sit through two ultrasounds, watch a video of complete lies tying abortion to breast cancer and other health risks, and told multiple times that if I just came back for one more appointment, they could schedule my abortion. At one point, someone told me that I wasn\\u2019t \\u201Cthe type to get an abortion.\\u201D One in four women in the US has an abortion in their lifetime. There is no type. The state of Louisiana is trying to paint abortion providers as not having their patients\\u2019 best interests at heart. In reality, abortion providers were the only people I found who weren\\u2019t manipulative and coercive. It wasn\\u2019t until I went to Planned Parenthood that I finally got the information I needed. I was told where I could get an abortion and what the process would be like. I traveled 250 miles each way to Hope Medical Group in Shreveport, home to one of the three remaining abortion clinics in the state: once for state-mandated counseling, and once for my procedure. Both times, the doctors and staff at the health center made me feel supported, not judged. I was asked multiple times to confirm that this was what I wanted and that I was not being pressured into ending my pregnancy. They empowered me to make my own decision. Unlike the crisis pregnancy center. Unlike the state government. In early January, 207 anti-abortion politicians wrote an amicus brief to the Supreme Court regarding the upcoming Louisiana case, arguing that the right to abortion is \\u201Cunworkable.\\u201D The threat has never been more clear. As a woman in Louisiana, my opinion should carry more weight than these 207 mostly male politicians who are not women in Louisiana (That\\u2019s right: None of the brief\\u2019s signers are Louisiana women who would be affected by the ruling. And only 13 of them are women.) What I know from personal experience is that it\\u2019s already very hard to get an abortion in Louisiana. The state has put up a series of hoops women must jump through \\u2014 including state-mandated counseling designed to convince you not to have an abortion, and a waiting period designed to put you in time out and make you travel back and forth to multiple appointments. I jumped through their hoops and more. I don\\u2019t wish my experience on anyone. Like most women, I do not regret my abortion. I was able to keep my livelihood, without worrying about whether having a child would make me an undesirable employee or about how I would make ends meet. Today I am still working in that job, helping low-income residents with housing. There are 1 million women of reproductive age in Louisiana. Our choices about our bodies and our futures are individual decisions. Politicians in Washington and in Baton Rouge can write their opinions about abortion in legal briefs, in newspapers, in speeches to their donors. They\\u2019re entitled to those opinions. But they are not entitled to use their position to make my decision for me.Jasmine Rivers is an avid supporter of women's rights, who enjoys watching reruns of The Office and supporting her local Planned Parenthood."},{"author":"Josue De Luna Navarro","title":"How Cruelty At The Mexican Border Became An American Export","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/josuenavarro\/cruelty-at-the-border-american-export","content":"In the early weeks of 2020, hundreds of Central American families once again woke up and started a long northward journey together. It\\u2019s a journey they\\u2019re forced to take to avoid persecution, economic instability, and the consequences of the climate crisis. Though the Trump administration has made it all but impossible for Central Americans to get asylum in the US, a new caravan of immigrants has set out from Honduras on foot in hopes of reaching the United States to seek asylum. They are already facing the cruelty of US border enforcement thousands of miles before reaching the US border itself. Honduran security forces have thrown tear gas at the caravan and Guatemalan authorities have turned away immigrants at the border, the AP reports, while Mexico has declared flatly they won\\u2019t allow any immigrant to get to the United States. Through a combination of threats and tariffs, the US is cajoling countries on the caravan route to turn back these desperate asylum-seekers on its behalf. Homeland Security personnel aren\\u2019t confined to their own homeland anymore, either \\u2014 according to the AP, embedded Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are \\u201Cproviding advisory and capacity building support\\u201D at the Guatemala\\u2013Honduras border as well. The Trump administration has been uniquely cruel to these refugees, from its notorious family separation practices to its \\u201CRemain in Mexico\\u201D policy that forces asylum-seekers to remain in immigrant camps in Mexico. Trump himself has even called on authorities to illegally shoot immigrants. But the southward expansion of border enforcement is a project that the US Customs Border and Protection has been working on for more than 15 years. All the way back in 2004, CBP commissioner Robert Bonner declared: \\u201CAmerican borders are the last line of defense, not the first line.\\u201D Honduran asylum-seekers now know that firsthand. The CBP\\u2019s 2020 strategic plan advocates a \\u201Cmulti-layered comprehensive approach\\u201D to border control. It envisions the CBP working with international partners \\u201Cto develop a seamless network of integrated law enforcement capabilities spanning the border environment.\\u201D Or, as a mission statement earlier in the document declares directly: \\u201CWe safeguard the American homeland at and beyond our borders.\\u201D In his book Empire of Borders, author Todd Miller quotes former US soldier James Campbell, who said the goal of this approach is to ensure that \\u201Call borders face south\\u201D \\u2014 and that immigrants never reach the US\\u2013Mexico border in the first place. Accordingly, the Trump administration has frozen aid and deployed tariffs to force impoverished Central American countries and Mexico to enforce this most expansive vision of the US border. The bullying worked. Last June, after Trump threatened higher tariffs on Mexico, the country dispatched 15,000 soldiers to its southern border with the goal of turning back asylum-seekers headed north. By all accounts, they\\u2019re doing so aggressively. In August, the Trump administration deployed 65 CBP and 24 ICE agents to Guatemala City to assist in border control. There, as U.S. News and World Report reported this month, ICE agents have been assisting Guatemalan law enforcement in the arrest of immigrants in the caravans. Immigrants themselves are aware of these risks. But whatever the cruel measures deployed against them, most say the risk is worth escaping the conditions they\\u2019re fleeing. \\u201CWe aren\\u2019t living here, we\\u2019re just surviving,\\u201D Honduran asylum-seeker Elmer Garcia, 26, told the Associated Press. \\u201CSo it doesn\\u2019t make much difference if you die there, or die here.\\u201D In times like these, it\\u2019s easy to feel disempowered by the magnitude of the issue. But there is a simple way for us to protect immigrants risking their lives seeking refuge: We must push Congress to defund the border industrial complex. All the anti-immigrant operations carried out by ICE and CBP are funded by our own taxpayer dollars. And every last one of those dollars is appropriated by Congress. So, tell your member to commit to cutting all money for ICE and CBP. Seeking asylum is a legal right, and the freedom of movement is a human right. Let\\u2019s defund hate and uphold our collective right to freedom.

We live in a cynical culture, and yet the young, beautiful, talented, and famous still thrill us. They remind us we\\u2019re still optimistic, still capable of being awed. Kobe Bryant was one of the greatest athletes in the world, someone whose beauty and grace and power on the court was, even for total laypeople like me, still so very obvious and so very stunning. He was only 41, a dedicated father, a beloved son, a caring husband, a good friend. The eight people who died with him, including three young girls \\u2014 Payton Chester, Alyssa Altobelli, and Bryant\\u2019s own daughter Gianna \\u2014 had so much promise and were beloved by so many people. They are all grieving today, and my heart hurts for all of them. And also. You know the and also, don\\u2019t you? That Kobe Bryant was accused of raping a woman? My heart hurts for her too. It\\u2019s uncomfortable to raise the worst thing someone has ever done when that someone dies, especially when they are beloved. And I suppose it matters I write this as someone who thinks that very, very few of us are all good or all bad; few of us are saintly, even fewer irredeemable. We can admire aspects of a person\\u2019s talent without erasing the ways they also did irreparable damage. We can be horrified and angry about what someone did without writing them off as worthless, without seeing them go away \\u2014 to jail, to the grave \\u2014 and saying \\u201Cgood riddance.\\u201D But is it an affront to bring up the bad things someone did, so soon after they die, when their loved ones and their admirers are still grieving? How bad do those bad things have to be to merit immediate mention? How good do the good things have to be to justify silencing the rest? (Do we imagine, for example, that when Harvey Weinstein dies, his talents and wonderful movies will merit courteous silence on his alleged sexual abuses?) How do you balance the pain that raising sexual assault allegations will cause family and fans against the pain felt by so many survivors of sexual violence who are again watching a beloved man being internationally lauded, the inconvenient parts of his story \\u2014 the woman who says he raped her \\u2014 politely excised? These are not easy questions. There is no scale to weigh them on. Kobe\\u2019s extraordinary ability is key to his story. And it is not the whole story. Out of some mislaid definition of respect, we are so excellent at sidelining the inconvenient parts \\u2014 at least when the inconvenient parts are women, and the one who is inconvenienced is a man we would prefer to keep admiring without complication. The inconvenient part of Kobe\\u2019s story was a teenager, 19 years old. She worked at a hotel where Kobe stayed. The details are all out there if you want to know them. Kobe initially told the police nothing happened. Then when the police told him they had blood and semen evidence, he said, well, ok, something did happen, but it was consensual. The woman had a bruise on her neck. She had genital injuries and vaginal tears consistent with trauma. Her underwear and a T-shirt of Kobe\\u2019s were stained with her blood. The full weight of Kobe Bryant\\u2019s money, power, and influence came down on her. His lawyers suggested she was sexually promiscuous. One psychology professor studied the coverage of the case and found that more than 40% of news stories questioned the truthfulness of the woman\\u2019s account; only 7.7% questioned Kobe\\u2019s honesty. The young woman \\u2014 the teenager \\u2014 settled out of court. As part of the agreement, Kobe apologized. We like to think of celebrity-watching as an escape from real life, but it\\u2019s more of a mirror. The way we bestow celebrity status reflects what we value; so too does where and how and why we deem celebrities good or bad or admirable or deplorable. The Kobe Bryant rape case reflected something very ugly back at us, and the fact that we just don\\u2019t know what to do with that information upon his death shows that, yes, we have changed \\u2014 at least editors and anchors and reporters and commentators are wringing their hands about how to deal with it. But we are still very much in flux. We still don\\u2019t know how to tell human stories when a life ends, only heroes\\u2019 journeys or villains\\u2019 defeats. A lot of people want Kobe to be an uncomplicated luminary, a great man without inconvenient addendums, and yet here is the inconvenient shadow of a female form darkening the background. Maybe the stories we tell about our culture\\u2019s most resonant figures should strive to be true, for better or worse. Maybe the reason we care about Kobe Bryant dying is because his life was never just about Kobe Bryant, but about all of the aspirations and values we pinned onto him, and it is for exactly that reason that there is no disrespect or invasion of privacy in insisting that the inconvenient parts live alongside the admirable ones, that the ugly is a neighbor to the exquisite. People are grieving for a much-admired man, for too many lives cut short, for promise snuffed out, and for families in pain. Others \\u2014 especially those whose lives have been impacted by sexual violence \\u2014 may be grieving in another direction, painfully reminded of all the ways women are erased so great men may be sanctified. We can make space for both experiences without shouting each other down or suggesting that one set of emotions has less of a right to be expressed than another does. That same work of compassion also calls on us to remember that no person is an island. All our lives leave ripples. Some lives are tsunamis. Compassion is not summarizing the beauty of the wave; it\\u2019s picking through the wreckage, reckoning with who was hurt. Awe without honesty isn\\u2019t respect; it\\u2019s myth. Admiration of only the easy parts is fanaticism, not reverence. And if we want a world in which our stories are more honest than the heroes-and-villains framework allows, then we have to start by telling the whole truth.Jill Filipovic is the author of The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness.

I could smell the smoke as soon as I landed in Sydney. You can smell it in New Zealand and South America. When the doors of my Qantas plane opened and I stepped onto the jet bridge, I was met with the unmistakable scent of my country ablaze. I left the airport and found a country I barely recognized: Blankets of smoke on the streets of inner Sydney that were so thick on some days that you couldn\\u2019t see to the end of the road. People wearing masks as they made their way to work. Evening news broadcasts packed with apocalyptic scenes from down south, where the fires were raging worst: darkness in the middle of the day, children under bloodred skies, unimaginable death and destruction. Everywhere I went, the fires were the main topic of conversation. Friends told me they were having trouble sleeping, wide awake at night thinking about loved ones in danger zones or simply worried about Australia\\u2019s future. At my cousin\\u2019s harborside wedding in mid-January, we led a thankful toast for the heavy rain that had arrived to drench the celebrations. It was the first anyone could recall in months. Most stark, though, was the change in political tenor. A conservative government that had surprised everyone \\u2014 including themselves \\u2014 by romping to victory just seven months before in an election dominated by discussions of taxes on investment properties was now very much in the fire zone. People were floored that the prime minister decided to vacation in Hawaii amid the disaster, but the real fury went deeper.

It won\\u2019t hurt you!\\u201D \\u2014 was suddenly being pilloried for his lack of any real climate policy.

In his 2019 State of the Union address, he said of sky-high drug prices: \\u201CThis is wrong, this is unfair, and together we will stop it \\u2014 and we\\u2019ll stop it fast.\\u201D Americans are facing a prescription drug cost crisis of devastating proportions, all while big pharmaceutical companies and their CEOs are making money hand over fist. In 2016, for the first time in a long time, policymakers seemed to be on the same page about the need to take on Big Pharma and tackle this challenge. Instead, three years since Trump committed to getting this done, prices continue marching upward, patients are still paying the price, and people across the country deserve to know why. Just recently we learned that despite historic profits and continued massive payouts to its executives and shareholders, Big Pharma has once again brazenly raised the prices of over 500 drugs this year by an average of 5.4% \\u2013 double the rate of inflation. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar\\u2019s former employer Eli Lilly increased the cost of its popular diabetes drug by 6%. And pharmaceutical companies have increased their prices for drugs for patients with cancer, HIV, arthritis, depression, asthma, and many other common health issues \\u2014 by more than 10% in some cases. So why is this? How could Trump make such a clear commitment, have the buy-in of members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, and still make no actual progress? Unfortunately, the answer is clear: Big Pharma has taken just a portion of its record profits and invested in doing everything possible to prevent any policy changes that would put its carve-outs, giveaways, sweetheart deals, or profits at risk. And nowhere is this corruption more egregious than within Trump\\u2019s administration. Here are just a few examples. It starts at the top. Before Azar joined the administration, he was a top executive getting paid millions of dollars by Eli Lilly, including a severance package of $1.6 million, which was paid out prior to joining the administration. Keagan Resler Lenihan \\u2014 the chief of staff at the FDA and former senior counselor to the HHS secretary \\u2014 ran lobbying efforts for the pharmaceutical company McKesson as senior director of government affairs from 2011\\u20132016. In November, federal prosecutors launched a new criminal investigation into McKesson's opioid work; the company is currently facing an investor lawsuit regarding drug price-fixing. The director of the Domestic Policy Council for the White House is Joe Grogan. From 2011 to 2017, he was a lobbyist for the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences. The House Oversight Committee looked into Grogan's conflict of interest; Rep. Elijah Cummings said it appeared to \\\"run afoul of the Trump Administration\\u2019s own ethics rules.\\\" Since joining the administration, Grogan has worked to roll back drug pricing control efforts, including inviting a member of his former employer\\u2019s advisory board to speak to a working group, ostensibly trying to bring down drug prices. The Atlantic reported that he \\\"seems poised to take his momentum into drug pricing, pushing largely to maintain the 'status quo.'\\\" The revolving door between government and Big Pharma has been well oiled in this administration. Mary-Sumpter Lapinski, who worked in government affairs for Bristol-Myers Squibb from 2002\\u20132007, served as a counselor to the health and human services secretary for public health and science. As of April 2019, Lapinski is the vice president of global government affairs for biopharmaceutical company Greenwich Biosciences. These are just a few examples from the very top of Trump\\u2019s health care and drug policy world \\u2014 but the list of people in this administration who have been bought and paid for by Big Pharma, and the list of people who have left the administration and cashed out with a Big Pharma job, is extensive and growing. This is corruption, plain and simple. It\\u2019s corruption that doesn\\u2019t just hurt taxpayers, it impacts every community in the country. And it\\u2019s corruption that needs to end. That is why Accountable.US just launched a new campaign called Patients Over Pharma to shine a spotlight on this corruption and help people across the country learn the facts. Because we believe that people deserve to know the truth about what policymakers are doing on this issue, whom they are being influenced by, and what they can do to fight back. The Patients Over Pharma campaign will focus on exposing the deep ties between the Trump administration and the pharmaceutical industry, the revolving door between Big Pharma and the federal government, and how this corruption is hurting patients and preventing any meaningful progress toward reducing the cost of prescription drugs. We will expose new facts about the deep ties between drug companies and elected officials and policymakers, and make sure those in power keep their promise to lower the costs of prescription drugs for American patients and their families. As part of this work, we will be keeping tabs and making sure the public stays updated on the latest on Trump administration officials who've made millions of dollars from the pharmaceutical industry, the number of pharmaceutical companies and lobbying groups represented in the administration, the revolving door between it and Big Pharma, and more. Patients Over Pharma will be pushing for meaningful reforms, like the House-passed Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019. Trump is backpedaling from his prior support while Senate leaders are declaring it dead on arrival, but we\\u2019re going to make sure people understand the Big Pharma influence that is driving this opposition and what they can do about it. We will be guided by a simple philosophy: Our government should be working in the interests of patients and families, not the pharmaceutical industry, its lobbyists, or its profits. Where corruption exists, the American people deserve to know about it \\u2014 and we\\u2019re going to do everything we can to help make that happen. After three years of broken promises, delayed action, and blatant corruption, it\\u2019s time for patients and families to learn the facts and demand immediate action.Kyle Herrig is the president of Accountable.US."},{"author":"Kate Andrias","title":"How To Make Every Job A Good Union Job","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/kateandrias\/opinion-how-to-make-every-job-a-good-union-job","content":"Cierra Brown works at a McDonald's in Durham, North Carolina. She earns little more than minimum wage, and even with a second job at a local hospital she can\\u2019t afford health insurance and pays for her diabetes medication out of pocket. She is frequently asked to stay late and close the store, hours after the bus stops running. If she complains, she knows she could lose her job \\u2014 and nothing would change anyway. She\\u2019s far from alone. More than 40% of US workers make less than $15 an hour. Amid this national crisis for the working class, support for unions has risen to its highest level in 50 years. But our current labor laws make the protections of a union virtually impossible to obtain for Cierra and tens of millions of other workers like her. If you\\u2019re a lawmaker who wants to dramatically improve the lives of US workers, fixing those broken laws should be at the top of your to-do list. The solutions are well known and already used in democracies around the world \\u2014 including virtually everywhere in Europe. And they would work here too, not just for fast-food workers like Cierra but for the Uber drivers, warehouse staffers, home care workers, and on-demand delivery drivers who are being employed in ever-greater numbers in today\\u2019s economy. The core problem facing these workers is that our current labor laws only require organizing and bargaining to be done at the individual worksite. In order for Cierra to win a union contract, for example, a majority of the workers at her McDonald's outlet would need to vote to unionize. But there\\u2019s so much turnover, it\\u2019s hard to know who works at the restaurant. Meanwhile, their boss has made clear he\\u2019s against a union, and they know from other workers\\u2019 experience that if they file for a union election, they\\u2019ll likely face illegal threats and maybe even firings. Even worse, McDonald's corporate would not be required to join the bargaining, nor would workers at other McDonald's locations be allowed to join. In a better system, workers across the fast-food industry would be covered by a sector-wide bargaining agreement. Their employers would no longer need to compete by lowering wages and reducing benefits to match the most worker-hostile company in their sector. Instead, competition would be based on the quality of their products or the excellence of their services. Our current system has profound shortcomings: First, worksite-by-worksite bargaining creates a major incentive for employers to fight unionization in order to avoid having to pay higher wages than their competitors. Second, it encourages corporations to outsource work to nonunion contractors or to classify employees as independent contractors. Third, it creates divisions between the lucky workers who belong to a union and those who do not, making it harder to win better conditions for all workers. A system that provides rights to all workers across a given sector, not just everyone at one worksite or one franchise, solves these problems. The many democracies that already have such a system have far greater collective bargaining coverage than the United States does. Not surprisingly, researchers have found that broad, sector-wide collective bargaining coverage tends to reduce economic inequality. Sectoral bargaining is particularly effective at raising wages and benefits in industries that are highly fissured, and ones with high numbers of independent contractors. In the US, those are the industries in which women, people of color, and immigrants are disproportionately represented \\u2014 yet another reason why this system would promote deeper social equality. A consensus is building for such a system here in the US. Clean Slate for Worker Power, a coalition of more than 80 participants from labor, academia, and nonprofits, convened out of Harvard Law School\\u2019s Labor and Worklife Program, today released a set of sweeping recommendations to fundamentally rewrite US labor laws. The report calls for sectoral bargaining, as well as other proposals that would help shift the balance of power in this country back into the hands of working people like Cierra. Why push for such reform now? We can\\u2019t afford to wait. Our country is suffering from staggering economic inequality, in large part because of the decline of the labor movement. Unions redistribute wealth \\u2014 from owners to workers, from rich to poor. Their decline explains why we now lack a check on concentrated economic power. It also explains much of the current crisis of political inequality. As wealth gets more and more concentrated, elites build greater and greater political power; they translate that into favorable policies that make them even richer. When unions were strong, they not only helped limit the concentration of wealth, they also engaged millions of everyday people in the political process; that in turn helped ensure the government was responsive to the needs and desires of low-income and middle-class people. The decline means working people have lost their most effective voice in our democracy. And it explains the mounting problems in working people\\u2019s everyday lives \\u2014 not just low wages, but unpredictable schedules, dangerous working conditions, and too many employers who fail to treat their workers with dignity and respect. History shows us that when workers join together and form their own organizations, they\\u2019re able to counter the power of corporations, with game-changing results for our economy and society. Our legal system must enable working people to build those organizations and use them effectively. The time has come for a system of bargaining for all.Kate Andrias is a law professor at the University of Michigan Law School."},{"author":"Zoe Tillman","title":"Trump Official Federico Klein Charged In Capitol Riot Released","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/zoetillman\/trump-official-federico-klein-released-capitol-riot","content":"WASHINGTON \\u2014 A former Trump administration appointee charged with clashing with police during the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol will be allowed to go home, a judge ruled Monday, denying prosecutors' request to keep him behind bars. Federico Klein's alleged actions on Jan. 6 were \\\"deeply troubling\\\" and revealed \\\"some propensity for violence, as well as a blatant disregard for the law,\\\" US District Judge John Bates in Washington, DC, wrote. Klein, 42, is facing an eight-count indictment, including multiple felony charges for assaulting and interfering with police at the Capitol and trying to obstruct Congress from certifying the results of the presidential election. But Bates found that other factors weighed in favor of releasing Klein as his case goes forward, including the lack of evidence that he planned for violence or took a leadership role; the fact that prosecutors hadn't objected to release for other Capitol riot defendants charged with assaulting police; and Klein's minimal past criminal history. \\\"Klein\\u2019s conduct was forceful, relentless, and defiant, but his confrontations with law enforcement were considerably less violent than many others that day, and the record does not establish that he intended to injure others,\\\" Bates wrote. Klein, who lives in Annandale, Virginia, has been in jail since his arrest on March 4 and will now be released to home detention. That means he can only leave his house for work, education, medical appointments, religious observances, court dates and meetings with his lawyer, and a small number of other preapproved reasons. The decision in Klein's case is the latest setback for the US attorney's office in Washington after the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit issued an opinion late last month that made it harder for prosecutors to successfully argue for pretrial detention in Capitol riot cases. Bates reversed a federal magistrate judge who had ordered Klein to stay in jail, finding that the DC Circuit's March 26 decision in the case of alleged Capitol rioters Eric Munchel and Lisa Eisenhart \\u2014 which set precedent that federal district judges such as Bates must follow going forward \\u2014 \\\"impacts the analysis.\\\" Prosecutors have withdrawn detention requests in some cases in the weeks since the DC Circuit issued the opinion in the Munchel case, particularly for defendants who aren't charged with assaulting police or taking a leadership role in planning for violence on Jan. 6. Klein had worked in the Office of Brazilian and Southern Cone Affairs and was still employed at the State Department when he allegedly participated in the insurrection. According to charging papers, Klein joined a mob of people who gathered at the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol and attempted to push through a line of police officers protecting one of the entrances to the building. Prosecutors presented screenshots from police body cameras that they said showed him using a riot shield to shove against officers and also to wedge a door open. They alleged that other open-source videos from the scene recorded Klein calling to the crowd behind him, \\\"We need fresh people, we need fresh people.\\\"Prosecutors argued that Klein's former position and the fact that he'd held top secret security clearance meant he was a danger to the community because he'd shown a \\\"contempt\\\" for the oath he took to defend the US Constitution. That argument proved persuasive before US Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui last month; Faruqui said that Klein had \\\"sworn an oath to protect then switched sides.\\\" But Bates wasn't convinced that Klein's past role in the Trump administration hurt his case for release now. Klein's alleged actions on Jan. 6 were \\\"troubling\\\" and represented a \\\"substantial and deeply concerning breach of trust,\\\" Bates wrote, but the judge wasn't clear how his previous job \\\"heightens\\\" his dangerousness going forward. Bates noted there was no suggestion by the government that Klein might try to abuse classified information he previously had access to and no evidence that he was affiliated with extremist groups. Bates cited other cases involving alleged Capitol rioters charged with hitting or deploying a Taser against police \\u2014 and where there also wasn't evidence of advance planning \\u2014 in which prosecutors didn't argue for detention. Those other cases didn't involve the same \\\"duration of force\\\" alleged in Klein's case, the judge wrote, but noted that Klein's \\\"most forceful conduct was directed to advancing and maintaining the mob\\u2019s position in the tunnel, not toward inflicting injury.\\\" \\\"He does not pose no continuing danger, as he contends, given his demonstrated willingness to use force to advance his personal beliefs over legitimate government objectives,\\\" Bates wrote. \\\"But what future risk he does present can be mitigated with supervision and other strict conditions on his release.\\\" In addition to home detention, Klein will be prohibited from going to the Capitol grounds, attending any political protests, contacting anyone else accused of participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection, and possessing any firearms or weapons. He'll also be subject to GPS monitoring. Bates did ding Klein for arguing that his conduct on Jan. 6 wasn't as serious as other defendants because he didn't actually make it inside the Capitol, calling that argument \\\"nonsensical.\\\" A spokesperson for the US attorney's office declined to comment. Klein's attorney Stanley Woodward Jr. did not immediately return a request for comment."},{"author":"Caroline Haskins","title":"Daunte Wright Killed By Police In Minnesota","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/carolinehaskins1\/daunte-wright-police-shooting-minnesota","content":"Police shot and killed a 20-year-old Black man on Sunday outside Minneapolis \\u2014 just a few miles away from where Derek Chauvin is on trial for the killing of George Floyd. Police in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, said in a statement that officers pulled a driver over for a traffic violation at around 2 p.m. on Sunday, then learned that he had an outstanding warrant. They began to arrest him, but \\u201Cthe driver re-entered the vehicle,\\u201D and then an officer shot him. Police did not release the victim's name, but Katie Wright identified him as her son, 20-year-old Daunte Wright. The shooting led hundreds of people to gather in front of the Brooklyn Center Police Department headquarters on Sunday night. Police fired tear gas, projectiles, and flash-bang grenades at protesters, as captured by pictures and videos tweeted from the scene. Later, at around 11:30 p.m., police declared the protests \\u201Cunlawful\\u201D and threatened to arrest anyone who remained, Minnesota Public Radio News reported. Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington claimed on Monday morning that about 20 businesses had been looted. Earlier in the day, hundreds had congregated at the scene of Wright\\u2019s death. Police officers arrived in riot gear, according to Minneapolis Star Tribune reporter Kim Hyatt. Some protesters smashed police car windshields, and a police officer shot a man with a rubber bullet, Hyatt tweeted. Wright\\u2019s mother, Katie, said her son was taking his new car to get it cleaned when he was pulled over by police, according to a tweet by MPR News reporter Tim Nelson. In a video shared on Facebook Live, Katie Wright said he was pulled over for having air fresheners in his car. (In some states, it's illegal to dangle air fresheners from a rearview mirror.) Brooklyn Center police did not disclose a specific \\\"traffic violation\\\" in its statement. The officers involved were wearing body cameras, which police believe \\\"were activated during this incident.\\\" Wright\\u2019s girlfriend was reportedly in the car at the time of the shooting. Brooklyn Center police said a female passenger in the car was treated for injuries at a local hospital. Wright is the father of a young child, Daunte Jr., who will turn 2 years old in July, according to Star Tribune reporter Kim Hyatt. Wright\\u2019s death comes at a time of heightened tension in and around Minneapolis, with a verdict looming for the May 2020 killing of George Floyd. Floyd's death sparked a surge of protests around the country last year, and police around the country responded to these protests with violence. Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed Floyd, has been on trial for murder since early March. When the trial began government buildings in Minneapolis were surrounded by barricades and fences, and authorities called in thousands of police officers and National Guard members. The National Guard arrived in Brooklyn Center on Monday morning in the wake of Sunday's shooting, according to Star Tribune reporter Andy Mannix. Harrington, the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, said state troopers are also being deployed to the area, and state officials are considering a curfew, according to Minneapolis Public Radio reporter Tim Nelson. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, a statewide agency that aids in certain state and local police investigations, tweeted Sunday that agents are en route to Brooklyn Center to investigate the shooting. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz tweeted Sunday that he was \\u201Cclosely monitoring the situation in Brooklyn Center\\u201D and is \\u201Cpraying for Daunte Wright\\u2019s family as our state mourns another life of a Black man taken by law enforcement.\\u201D Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott tweeted Sunday that the shooting was \\u201Ctragic.\\u201D He asked protesters to be peaceful, and for police to not respond with force.

One kick wasn\\u2019t enough to break through the locked door keeping hundreds of other rioters from entering the building, according to federal prosecutors, so Jerod Hughes joined the kicking, forcefully opening the gateway to chaos. Capitol rioters caused damages whose repair costs are estimated at $2.5 million, but according to the office responsible for maintaining the building, that estimate is a small fraction of the costs necessary to restore the historic building. On the day of the insurrection, rioters kicked doors, smashed windows, and ruined shutters. Some rioters used chemical irritants and fire extinguishers, which damaged statues and paintings in the Rotunda, the Crypt, and the National Statuary Hall, the office of the Architect of the Capitol said in an email. In February, the congressional Appropriations Committee approved a $30 million request for the Capitol architect\\u2019s team of \\u201Chighly specialized professionals\\u201D to treat and maintain damaged fabric and artwork and fund the National Guard\\u2019s temporary perimeter fencing. But according to Brett Blanton, the architect of the Capitol, those funds are not enough to cover a campuswide security assessment. In testimony to members of Congress, Blanton said that before the attack, his team was outside preparing the inauguration stage and painting the stands white and blue. Within hours, rioters destroyed the platform, damaged and stole sound systems and photography equipment, ripped two historic Olmsted lanterns from the ground, and tracked wet paint all over the stone balustrades and Capitol hallways. A BuzzFeed News analysis of court documents in the Capitol riot cases shows the range of damage and theft caused by rioters on Jan. 6, from breaking windows to stealing police gear. Many wanted souvenirs or trophies to bring home with them, including a member of Congress\\u2019s bottle of wine, a Fox News\\u2013branded football, and more. Of the more than 350 people charged so far in connection with the riot, 35 have been charged with destruction of government property and 21 are charged with theft of government or private property, according to a review of court records. The estimated value of the damage has consequences for defendants \\u2014 if it\\u2019s less than $1,000, the charge is a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of one year in prison. But if the government estimates the damage at more than $1,000, the crime becomes a felony that carries up to 10 years in prison. The same goes for people charged with stealing government property.Just outside the House chamber, Chad Barrett Jones, of Coxs Creek, Kentucky, allegedly used a flagpole to break the glass of the door.

Liberals are eager for Biden to reshape the bench after four years on the sidelines, but they\\u2019ve also already shown they\\u2019re prepared to call him out if his picks don\\u2019t embody the depth of professional and racial diversity they want to see. The White House announcement of Biden\\u2019s first nominees on March 30 was met with an immediate chorus of praise from liberal advocacy groups and Democrats in Congress. But that evening, two Latino civil rights organizations, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) and LatinoJustice PRLDEF, released a statement saying they were \\u201Cextremely disappointed\\u201D that just one of the 11 nominees was Latinx. \\u201CToday\\u2019s public rollout of judicial nominations in the expectation of unalloyed praise simply demonstrates the Administration\\u2019s apparent obtuseness about the importance of the Latino community in the nation\\u2019s legal system,\\u201D Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of MALDEF, and Juan Cartagena, president and general counsel of LatinoJustice PRLDEF, said at the time. Other liberal groups have applauded Biden\\u2019s focus on diverse picks while also noting that they weren\\u2019t happy to see nominees with backgrounds as federal prosecutors or corporate lawyers \\u2014 two traditional paths to the bench that some liberals want Biden to move away from. This week, two dozen public interest organizations sent a letter to White House counsel Dana Remus expressing \\u201Cconcern\\u201D that there weren\\u2019t any nominees \\u201Cwith genuine experience representing consumers and workers,\\u201D according to a copy reviewed by BuzzFeed News. That Biden is already facing pushback from his own base on judicial nominees contrasts with the largely united front conservatives presented when it came to former president Donald Trump\\u2019s choices for the bench. Republican senators and conservative groups objected to a handful of Trump nominees who they didn\\u2019t believe had solid enough conservative credentials or if there were concerns about qualifications or inflammatory past writings. But Trump didn\\u2019t face public criticism from Republicans this early, and the objections were never about categories of nominees or the White House\\u2019s overall approach. Biden has pledged to nominate judges who are not only diverse in terms of personal identity but also in their career trajectories. The majority of judges confirmed under Trump were men (75%) and white (83%), according to the federal judiciary\\u2019s public database, and a large number of them previously worked as assistant US attorneys or represented corporate clients at private law firms. Biden\\u2019s first slate includes several potentially history-making picks, including a New Jersey district court nominee who would be the first presidentially appointed Muslim American federal judge, along with four former public defenders and a civil rights lawyer. Widening the umbrella means inviting input \\u2014 and, potentially, criticism \\u2014 from an array of communities and organizations. Robert Raben, a former Clinton White House official who has advocated to diversify the bench, said he\\u2019s pleased to see the growing interest in judges across the progressive movement, even if it makes the work of selecting nominees more complicated for the White House. He\\u2019s long lamented that Democrats haven\\u2019t made federal judges a priority for voters and an integral part of their broader policy agenda the way conservatives have for years. When Trump, Senate Republicans, and conservative activists would talk about what they wanted in judges, they tended to focus on a few core issues, such as abortion opposition, gun rights, deregulation, and conservative legal philosophies. The Democratic Party\\u2019s \\u201Camalgam of dozens of interests,\\u201D on the other hand, makes selecting nominees that the base will rally around harder, Raben said. While he said he was \\u201C100% certain\\u201D Biden would make good on the pledge to choose diverse judges, he was \\u201Cdelighted\\u201D to see advocacy groups speaking out. \\u201CIn a system where squeaky wheels get grease, you have to squeak,\\u201D Raben said. Linda Jun, senior policy counsel at Americans for Financial Reform, one of the groups that sent the letter to Remus this week advocating for more professional diversity, said their coalition wanted to make sure the White House got the message about \\u201Cthe need to have judges who have the perspective of doing work representing regular people.\\u201D Jun said her organization, which formed after the financial crisis of 2008, hadn\\u2019t always been involved in advocacy around judges but \\u201Cevolved\\u201D over the past decade, especially after the 200-plus federal judges confirmed under Trump. \\u201CThere\\u2019s not just automatic loyalty or support [for Biden], and I think that\\u2019s a good thing,\\u201D Jun said. \\u201CWe want to push the administration to be better. It\\u2019s not just, \\u2018You\\u2019re not Trump\\u2019 or \\u2018You\\u2019re on the left and that\\u2019s enough and we\\u2019re going to accept that.\\u2019\\u201D Federal judgeships are lifetime appointments, which makes the stakes higher than they are for other presidentially nominated posts. Presidents typically defer to home-state senators to choose district court nominees; senators can suggest candidates for appeals court seats, but the White House takes more of a lead role, since those courts set precedents and judges\\u2019 ideological backgrounds are more likely to matter in decision-making. Presidents who try to go around senators risk losing support \\u2014 and, most importantly, votes \\u2014 during the Senate confirmation process. For a brief period in late 2017, Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana publicly sparred with then\\u2013White House counsel Don McGahn after he accused McGahn of trying to steamroll him on a federal appeals court nominee. HuffPost reported in December that Remus sent a letter to Democratic senators asking for diverse district court candidates and making clear that that was a priority for the Biden administration. The deference to home-state senators means outside groups sometimes have to lobby beyond the White House. After Colorado\\u2019s Democratic senators recommended Regina Rodriguez \\u2014 an attorney with a corporate-focused practice and a former assistant US attorney \\u2014 to the Biden administration for a district court judgeship, Demand Justice, a liberal group focused on the courts, launched an opposition campaign around the fact that Rodriguez lacked the professional diversity they wanted Biden to focus on. Rodriguez ultimately got the nomination. Other parts of her background underscore the overlapping interests the Biden administration is trying to balance. She was the lone Latina on the list, and her previous nomination to the Colorado court under former president Barack Obama was held up by the Republican-controlled Senate. Demand Justice released a mixed statement in response to Biden\\u2019s first slate. The group praised his pace on judges and selection of former public defenders, but, without mentioning Rodriguez or other nominees by name, said that \\u201Cold habits die hard for some senators who are used to recommending corporate lawyers and prosecutors for federal judgeships.\\u201D In an interview this week, Brian Fallon, executive director of Demand Justice, said he was \\u201Cfairly optimistic\\u201D about Biden\\u2019s future nominees. He said he understood Rodriguez and a few other names on the list represented \\u201Cunfinished business from 2016\\u201D and that Remus and her team could now start from scratch in working with senators as more seats open up. One highly anticipated announcement is for one of two vacancies on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, a uniquely powerful court that serves as the main forum for fights over executive power. Biden nominated US District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson \\u2014 a former federal public defender and a Black woman who is widely considered a frontrunner for the next Supreme Court vacancy \\u2014 for one of those seats. There are a dozen circuit court vacancies, 10 of which were announced after Biden was sworn in.

He was 99. \\u201CIt is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty The Queen announces the death of her beloved husband, His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,\\u201D Buckingham Palace said in a statement. \\u201CHis Royal Highness passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle. Further announcements will made in due course. The Royal Family join with people around the world in mourning his loss.\\u201D The prince had been admitted to the hospital earlier this year to receive treatment for an infection and surgery for a preexisting heart condition. He was released in mid-March.Married for more than 70 years, Philip was the longest-serving royal consort in British history. He was by his wife\\u2019s side as she oversaw a country and a royal family that has been transformed wildly from when she first assumed the throne in the early 1950s. \\u201CHe has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years,\\u201D the Queen said in 1997, in a speech to mark their 50th anniversary, \\u201Cand I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim, or we shall ever know.\\u201D Together, the pair had four children \\u2014 Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew, and Prince Edward \\u2014 as well as eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. Philip completed more than 22,000 solo public engagements, gave almost 5,500 speeches, made more than 600 foreign trips, and was involved in more than 780 organizations and charities during his extensive time in public life. He often jokingly referred to himself as \\u201Cthe world\\u2019s most experienced plaque-unveiler.\\u201D The occasionally gaffe-prone prince finally officially retired from his royal duties in 2017, at the age of 96, although he continued to be seen at weddings and other events. Theresa May, the former prime minister, said at the time of the prince\\u2019s retirement that the UK owed Philip their \\u201Cdeepest gratitude\\u201D for his many years of service to the country: \\u201CFrom his steadfast support for Her Majesty the Queen to his inspirational Duke of Edinburgh Awards and his patronage of hundreds of charities and good causes, his contribution to our United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and the wider world will be of huge benefit to us all for years to come.\\u201DBorn on a dining room table on June 10, 1921, in Corfu, Greece, Philip was the only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Princess Alice of Battenberg. He was the youngest of five children, with four older sisters. Following a coup, his family left Greece in December 1922 after his uncle, King Constantine I, abdicated. The young prince was spirited away in a crib fashioned out of a fruit box. The exiled family initially moved to France before spreading out across Europe. With his mother institutionalized with schizophrenia, Philip was sent to numerous schools, including Cheam prep school in England, Schule Schloss Salem in Germany, and the Gordonstoun School in Moray, Scotland. \\u201CI just had to get on with it,\\u201D the prince later said, of his tumultuous childhood. Throughout this time, Philip is said to have rarely seen his parents. Toward the end of his childhood his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, was believed to be his main guardian. Two of his sisters married members of the Nazi Party, and when one died in a 1937 plane crash, Philip was photographed marching along with Nazis in her funeral procession in Germany. The prince himself, though, was never a member of the Nazi Party. Indeed, after school, Philip attended Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, Devon, before fighting the Axis powers in World War II. It was while he was at the naval college that Philip was asked to show 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth and her sister, Princess Margaret, around during a visit by their father, King George VI, in 1939. (The two had first met as children at a 1934 wedding.) Following the encounter, Philip and Elizabeth, distant cousins, kept in touch and years later formed a relationship. With the outbreak of World War II, Philip was persuaded by his uncle to join the navy, rather than the air force. \\u201CIt seemed easier to join [the military] than be called up,\\u201D he told the BBC in 1995. \\u201CIt was inevitable that I was going to be in one of the services during the war. People of that age \\u2014 we just did. But, I mean, before that it hadn\\u2019t really occurred to me. I had vaguely thought, What could I do? Bit difficult being stateless.\\u201D In 1941 he worked aboard HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean, and in 1944 he rose to the rank of first lieutenant. He was on hand to witness the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay in 1945, as well as the Allied prisoners of war being released to British ships. \\u201CThese people were naval people. They were emaciated ... tears pouring down their cheeks, they just drank their tea, they really couldn\\u2019t speak,\\u201D he later recalled. \\u201CIt was a most extraordinary sensation.\\u201D After the war, the prince eventually returned to the UK, but the Telegraph reported that in letters to Princess Elizabeth he said he was \\u201Cstill not accustomed to the idea of peace,\\u201D claiming to be \\u201Crather fed up with everything and feeling that there was not much to look forward to and rather grudgingly accepting the idea of going on in the peacetime navy.\\u201D By the summer, though, his relationship with the future monarch had blossomed, and he wrote in a later letter, \\u201CTo have been spared in the war and seen victory, to have been given the chance to rest and to re-adjust myself, to have fallen in love completely and unreservedly, makes all one\\u2019s personal and even the world\\u2019s troubles seem small and petty.\\u201DForeign-born and an exiled royal, Philip was a controversial choice as a husband for the future Queen, but love won out. Philip and Elizabeth were engaged in 1946, although the princess\\u2019s father, George VI, asked for the announcement to be delayed until after his daughter\\u2019s 21st birthday, so the news was only made official in July 1947. Around this time, Philip renounced his Greek and Danish royal titles (his father was the grandson of King Christian IX of Denmark) and became a British subject, adopting the surname Mountbatten. On Nov. 20, 1947, Philip and Princess Elizabeth were married at Westminster Abbey in a ceremony broadcast on radio to 200 million people around the world. Some 10,000 congratulatory telegrams were sent to the couple, while the newlyweds also received more than 2,500 wedding gifts. Just before the marriage, Philip was officially given the title of Duke of Edinburgh. (The Queen ultimately bestowed the title of prince upon him in 1957.)After honeymooning at the Balmoral estate in Scotland, the newlyweds moved to Malta, where Philip resumed his career in the navy, rising to the rank of commander. In 1948, Philip and Elizabeth had their first child, Prince Charles, who was born at Buckingham Palace. His sister, Princess Anne, was born two years later. On Feb. 6, 1952, King George VI died while Philip and his wife were visiting Kenya. The Duke of Edinburgh was the one who told Princess Elizabeth that her father had died and that she was the new Queen of England. She was just 25 years old.The Queen\\u2019s ascension to the throne meant the end of Philip\\u2019s naval career. \\u201CIt was naturally disappointing,\\u201D he later said. \\u201CI had just been promoted to commander and the fact was that the most interesting part of my naval career was just starting.\\u201D In 2011, to mark the prince\\u2019s 90th birthday, the Queen bestowed him with the title of Lord High Admiral of the Navy, the ceremonial head of the force, in a move seen by some as recognition of the sacrifices he made professionally for his wife. As the male consort to a powerful woman in a still traditionally conservative era, Philip struggled for some time to forge an identity. \\u201CThere was no precedent,\\u201D he later recalled. \\u201CIf I asked somebody, \\u2018What do you expect me to do?\\u2019 they all looked blank. They had no idea, nobody had much idea.\\u201D The prince occupied himself, in part, by becoming a qualified pilot and by spearheading modernization efforts at Buckingham Palace and other royal residences.He also undertook a considerable amount of charity work during his lifetime, including championing environmentalism during his decades with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). While insisting he wasn\\u2019t \\u201Ca bunny hugger,\\u201D Philip framed his passion for conservation as a matter of practicality, rather than politics. \\u201CIf we\\u2019ve got this extraordinary diversity on this globe, it seems awfully silly for us to destroy it,\\u201D he said in a 2011 interview. \\u201CAll these other creatures have an equal right to exist here, we have no prior rights to the Earth than anybody else, and if they\\u2019re here, let\\u2019s give them a chance to survive.\\u201D Natural historian and broadcaster David Attenborough described the prince as extremely knowledgeable and recalled being intimidated by him on their first meeting. \\u201CHe\\u2019s formidable, he\\u2019s daunting, partly because of his position, but also because he is a very considerable intellect,\\u201D Attenborough said. \\u201CThe first time I met him, it was absolutely clear that if you turned up and you hadn\\u2019t mastered the papers, he would detect it very quickly and you would be in trouble.\\u201D In 1956, Philip also set up the Duke of Edinburgh\\u2019s Award program to encourage young people to complete social and physical development tasks. The popular scheme, inspired by Philip\\u2019s own time at Gordonstoun, continues to this day in dozens of countries around the world.Later in life, Philip became infamous for his sometimes controversial and racist remarks during royal visits. During a tour of a Scottish factory in 1999, for example, he said of a fuse box, \\u201CIt looks as though it was put in by an Indian.\\u201D And a year earlier, he said to a British trekker in Papua New Guinea, \\u201CYou managed not to get eaten, then?\\u201D His remarks often caused headaches for the royal family, painting him as an out-of-touch relic from another era. But his cousin, Countess Mountbatten, told the BBC that the prince\\u2019s off-the-cuff, plain-speaking style actually endeared him to many people. \\u201CHe always speaks his mind, sometimes not necessarily with a high degree of tact,\\u201D she said. \\u201CBut on the other hand, I think that people have come to expect that of him, and they really rather enjoy it and they think, how nice to hear somebody actually say what they think.\\u201DPhilip\\u2019s environmental adviser, Martin Palmer, who first met the duke in 1985 and cofounded the Alliance of Religions and Conservation with him in 1995, acknowledged he could be prickly. \\u201CGet him on a bad day and it\\u2019s quite hard work,\\u201D he said. \\u201CGet him on a good day, and you really don't want to be with anybody else.\\u201D Perhaps the prince\\u2019s most passionate fans, though, lived on a small island in Vanuatu. There, a remote community revered the prince as a deity and the embodiment of an ancient warrior.In 2011, it was announced Philip would be reducing his royal duties following his 90th birthday. He told the BBC at the time, \\u201CI reckon I\\u2019ve done my bit so I want to enjoy myself a bit now, with less responsibility, less frantic rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say.\\u201D In December of that year, he spent a number of days in the hospital after experiencing chest pains. He was also admitted to a hospital due to a bladder infection in 2012, and in June 2013 spent 10 days at the London Clinic after undergoing abdominal surgery. In April 2016, Philip joined the Queen in celebrating her 90th birthday at a series of events across the country. He also hosted Barack and Michelle Obama, then the president and first lady, at Windsor Castle, driving them into the property himself. The prince underwent hip replacement surgery in April 2018. He also survived a car crash at Sandringham Palace in January 2019, in which his vehicle collided with another and overturned. He later wrote to a woman who was injured in the other vehicle to tell her he was \\u201Cdeeply sorry.\\u201DIn May 2017, it was announced that Philip would be standing down from his royal duties. A statement from Buckingham Palace said the Duke of Edinburgh had \\u201Cdecided that he will no longer carry out public engagements from the autumn of this year.\\u201D \\u201CIn taking this decision, The Duke has the full support of The Queen,\\u201D the palace said. Recalling how the prince was the first royal to install computers in his office, historian Christopher Lee told the BBC in 2017 that the prince should be remembered as a naturally curious man. \\u201CHe will want to know about the big issues. He will know every single touch, nuance on Brexit, for example. He is briefed on everybody he is likely to meet, even people he will never meet and he takes it in,\\u201D Lee said. \\\"I think he\\u2019s never stopped being an admiral. Admirals are like that, they have to be, and admirals never retire.\\u201D"},{"author":"Paul McLeod","title":"Biden Signs Gun Control Orders, Urges Congress To Act","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/paulmcleod\/biden-gun-control-policy","content":"WASHINGTON \\u2014 President Joe Biden announced a series of executive actions on gun control Thursday. They are the first government steps in years to curb gun violence, but they also show the limits of what a president can do without Congress on board. \\u201CGun violence in this country is an epidemic and an international embarrassment,\\u201D Biden said Thursday during a ceremony at the White House Rose Garden. The actions include cracking down on untraceable \\u201Cghost guns,\\u201D funding anti\\u2013gun violence programs in communities, and limiting the availability of stabilizing braces that can make handguns akin to short-barreled rifles. But Biden acknowledged that there is only so much he can do. He spent much of his speech imploring Congress to take action. Changing the law to enact an assault weapons ban or fix the country\\u2019s loophole-ridden background check system can only be done with Congress. Whether any substantial gun control measure can pass the Senate, where Republicans have enough seats to filibuster a bill to death, is an open question. Those talks are currently happening behind closed doors. \\u201CI know it\\u2019s painful and frustrating that we haven\\u2019t made the progress that we\\u2019d hoped for,\\u201D Biden said after specifically mentioning expanded background checks and an assault weapons ban. \\u201CNo matter how long it takes, we\\u2019re going to get these passed. We\\u2019re not going to give up.\\u201D Of the measures announced Thursday, likely the most significant is a crackdown on so-called ghost guns, which are assembly kits of gun parts that are sold without serial numbers or background checks. These allow buyers to quickly put together a fully functioning, untraceable firearm. \\u201CAnyone from a criminal to a terrorist can buy this kit and in as little as 30 minutes put together a weapon. I want to see these kits treated as firearms,\\u201D said Biden. He said his administration will require these kits to be made with serial numbers subjected to background check rules, essentially applying the same standards that come with selling a fully assembled gun. The administration is also pushing out hundreds of millions of dollars for anti\\u2013gun violence programs in communities and beginning a study of firearms trafficking. Some of these measures will have limited real-world impact. The administration is drafting red flag legislation to authorize law enforcement to seize guns from people who are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. But this legislation is just a template, and it is not clear any states will adopt it. Several states have already drafted and passed red flag laws. Notably absent from the list is an expansion of which gun sellers must perform background checks. Some people are able to sell many guns per year without being subject to the background check standards of retailers because they are not considered to be in the gun sales business. But Biden hinted that more actions will be coming in the future. The executive orders come shortly after deadly mass shootings in Atlanta and Boulder. On Wednesday, an older couple and their two young grandchildren were shot dead in South Carolina; former NFL player Phillip Adams, who killed himself early Thursday morning, is believed to be the shooter. Gun advocacy groups cheered the executive actions as well as the appointment of David Chipman, a former senior adviser to the gun control group Giffords, as the next director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \\u201CGhost guns allow anyone anywhere to easily obtain an untraceable firearm, and the Biden administration\\u2019s decision to treat them like the deadly weapons they are will undoubtedly save countless lives,\\u201D said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety. Gabby Giffords, a shooting survivor and former member of Congress, who founded the advocacy group named after her, said the actions will \\u201Chelp address a crisis that devastates communities across the country on a daily basis.\\u201D The next major gun control push from Democrats will be to try to fix the country\\u2019s broken background check system, which is rife with exemptions and flat-out breakdowns, such as law enforcement not being able to complete background checks within the strict three-day waiting period. Senate Democrats are trying to lay the groundwork for a bill that expands background checks. In partnership with a regulatory expansion by the White House on individual sales, this could get the US to something loosely equivalent to a universal background check system for the first time. But Republicans remain dug in against any new gun control measures. At least 10 Republican votes are needed in the Senate to override a filibuster and pass any gun legislation. There were no signs on Thursday that politicians are budging from their usual positions. Republicans and pro-gun groups blasted Biden\\u2019s announcement as a violation of the Second Amendment and ineffective at stopping mass shootings. \\u201CThe answer is not to restrict the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens, the answer is to go after violent criminals and come down on them like a ton of bricks,\\u201D tweeted Sen. Ted Cruz."},{"author":"Scott Lucas","title":"You Probably Already Have Some Type Of Vaccine Passport","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/scottlucas\/vaccine-passports-already-exist","content":"On Monday, TV personality Dr. Drew tweeted his opposition to COVID-19 vaccine passports, saying, \\u201CThese vaccine passports segregate people and strip them of their freedom to travel internationally. Vaccinations are important, and I encourage everyone to get the Covid vaccine, but how would you feel if international travel also required other vaccinations?\\u201D On Tuesday, he walked it back \\u2014 but to thousands of people on Twitter, it seemed like a good question. It is not. While vaccine passports have emerged as the latest flashpoint in the COVID-19 pandemic, most people already have some form of documentation verifying they've been vaccinated against certain diseases. And many public health experts say such proof will be key to getting life back to normal while preventing future COVID-19 outbreaks. \\u201CPeople have suffered for over a year, and they want their lives back,\\u201D Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CThey want to go to restaurants, see movies, travel to see their loved ones, and return to the workplace. Vaccine passports offer a pathway to a more rapid and safer return to normal life.\\u201D As vaccines become more widely distributed, the prospect of COVID-19 vaccine passports is becoming a reality for many people. The European Union is likely to launch them in June. Israel, which leads major nations in vaccines administered so far, has already introduced one. China has one too. The UK is debating its own version. New York state has introduced a voluntary \\u201CExcelsior Pass\\u201D that shows proof of vaccination or a negative test for access to sporting events, music venues, and businesses. At least eight major airlines are working on a version of a coronavirus passport, as is Walmart. More than 64 million people, or nearly 1 in 5 Americans, have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 so far. But the federal government \\u2014 including Anthony Fauci, chief of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases \\u2014 has so far made clear it won\\u2019t lead efforts to produce a national vaccine passport. Instead, it is working to corral the more than a dozen versions being developed in the private sector. Many Republican leaders have balked at such measures, suggesting they would constitute a governmental overreach. On Friday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an executive order banning the use of COVID-19 vaccination passports in the state. On Sunday, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves told CNN that he also opposed them. On Tuesday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott joined in. \\u201CThe passport is a good idea,\\u201D Howard Markel, a pediatrician and medical historian, told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CHow it has become politicized is very disturbing and difficult for people in public health to understand.\\u201D That politicization has had a real impact. A recent poll found that only 50% of US residents would support a voluntary document that verifies vaccination.The debate in the US is in many ways a rerun of those about lockdowns and contact tracing. Should people in the US accept restrictions on their personal liberty in the name of public health? Will these temporary measures stay around long after they are needed? Will people's privacy be protected? But the idea of vaccine passports is nothing new: The US already has a patchwork of private and public entities that require people to show they have been vaccinated. \\u201CWe already keep records of vaccinations in our medical records. Schools keep records of kids. Many hospitals keep them for their staff. These should be familiar,\\u201D Gostin said. To travel internationally, many people already have to prove they have been vaccinated. To enter the US, immigrants must provide a record of vaccination against diseases \\u2014 14 in all \\u2014 including hepatitis A and B, two types of influenza, polio, and chickenpox. Records are kept in a booklet issued by the World Health Organization. The US Armed Forces, which sends its members all over the world, requires around a dozen vaccinations depending on where a person is deployed. Proof of vaccination is also required to enroll kids in school in all 50 states. In Florida, where DeSantis is governor, children in kindergarten through 12th grade are required to be vaccinated against six diseases. California and Texas each require seven. Since vaccination requirements for schools are handled at the state level \\u2014 there is no federal mandate \\u2014 many states allow personal belief or religious exemptions for parents to opt out. California is among the states that removed such exemptions after a dangerous measles outbreak that started at Disneyland in 2015 hit the state. For as long as there have been vaccines, public health officials have required people to prove they have received them. As historian Jordan E. Taylor wrote in Time magazine, beginning in the 19th century, US authorities mandated that people show that they had been vaccinated against smallpox. Immigration officials required proof of vaccination at Ellis Island in New York and Angel Island in San Francisco. Businesses mandated it as a condition of employment. And during local outbreaks, police would demand people show they had been vaccinated.There are real concerns about vaccine passports. Some people worry about their digital rights or invasion of privacy. But Gostin, who coauthored a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association about the possible ethical issues, said vaccine passports would contain very little information. \\u201CIn many ways vaccine passports protect your privacy. They don't require you to disclose any information, other than if you got a vaccine or not,\\u201D he wrote. Others raise doubts about the fairness of requiring proof of vaccination in the US, since so far Black and Latinx communities have been vaccinated at disproportionately low rates. Experts take that seriously but suggested that those concerns will diminish as vaccines become more widely available. \\u201CEquity can't be an afterthought,\\u201D Gostin said. \\u201CWe can't have passports while there's vaccine scarcity. Within a month or two, the vaccines will be chasing the people, not the reverse. Everyone will have a fair shot at getting it.\\u201D Public health experts stressed that it\\u2019s understandable if people feel unsure about vaccine passports and encouraged them to speak with their healthcare providers if they had questions. \\u201CMy recommendation is to consult your doctor or the websites of the WHO or the CDC,\\u201D said Markel. \\u201CHave a good conversation with your doctor. We don't want to bully people.\\u201D"},{"author":"Zoe Tillman","title":"Alleged Capitol Rioter Cooperating With Prosecutors","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/zoetillman\/capitol-riots-jon-schaffer-plea-deal-talks-oath-keepers","content":"WASHINGTON \\u2014 Federal prosecutors are in \\u201Cadvanced plea negotiations\\u201D with an alleged Capitol rioter with Oath Keeper ties in exchange for his cooperation with the ongoing investigation of the Jan. 6 Capitol insurgency, a new filing in federal court revealed Monday. The public filing had apparently been made in error \\u2014 prosecutors had intended to file it under seal because the defendant, Jon Schaffer, was already providing information to the government. Revealing his cooperation \\u201Cmay reveal the existence, scope, and direction of the ongoing and confidential investigation,\\u201D Assistant US Attorney Ahmed Baset wrote in the brief, which was quickly removed from the public docket but has been viewed by BuzzFeed News. It was not immediately clear how the document ended up on the public docket. The government had previously shared in public court filings and hearings that it is extending plea offers to some of the more than 350 people charged to date with participating in the Capitol insurrection. But prosecutors have been nonspecific about the timelines and terms of those plea negotiations and in this filing said its negotiations with Schaffer were \\u201Cthe first and most advanced\\u201D involving \\u201Cany of the over 300 Capitol Riot defendants.\\u201D Among other things, Schaffer, who is 53 and from Columbus, Indiana, was charged with spraying US Capitol Police officers with \\u201Cbear spray\\u201D as he and other rioters tried to push officers back in order to force their way into the Capitol. Prosecutors said Schaffer, whom they note is well known for his role as the guitarist and main songwriter for the heavy metal band Iced Earth, was captured on surveillance tape inside the Capitol building carrying \\u201Cbear spray\\u201D and holding clear sunglasses. He was arrested on Jan. 17 and has been in detention since then. At the time of his arrest, prosecutors noted a connection between Schaffer and organized extremist group the Oath Keepers, pointing out that he was wearing a baseball cap reading \\u201COath Keepers Lifetime Member\\u201D on Jan. 6. In a separate case, a dozen alleged Oath Keepers members and associates have been charged with conspiracy for their role in the events of that day, although Schaffer has not been identified in court papers as being involved with that group of defendants. The Indiana Oath Keepers chapter released a statement a week after Schaffer was arrested saying he is \\u201CNOT\\u201D a member of that group. Monday\\u2019s filing didn\\u2019t include any details about what information Schaffer has shared with investigators. \\u201CIf alerted to this information, investigation targets against whom the defendant may be providing information about could be immediately prompted to flee from prosecution, destroy or conceal incriminating evidence, alter their operational tactics to avoid future detection, attempt to influence or intimidate potential witnesses, and otherwise take steps to undermine the investigation and avoid future prosecution,\\u201D Baset wrote.A spokesperson for the US attorney\\u2019s office in Washington, DC, and Schaffer\\u2019s attorney did not immediately return requests for comment. On Sunday night, the government publicly filed a request with the court to push back deadlines in Schaffer\\u2019s case and indicated in general terms that they were discussing a plea deal. On Monday at around 3:55 p.m., according to an automatic email alert that goes out from the court\\u2019s internal filing system whenever a new document is posted on the public docket, the government filed a supplement with the court that included more details about the status of Schaffer\\u2019s case, intending it to be under seal; it is no longer on the public docket. The prosecutor, Baset, wrote that Schaffer had participated in a \\u201Cseries of debrief interviews\\u201D since early March. In exchange for Schaffer\\u2019s cooperation, the government was considering giving up its effort to keep Schaffer in jail while his case is pending and instead allow him to go free until he is sentenced. \\u201CBased on these debrief interviews, the parties are currently engaged in good-faith plea negotiations, including discussions about the possibility of entering into a cooperation plea agreement aimed at resolving the matter short of indictment,\\u201D Baset wrote. Baset wrote that because Schaffer was the first case to involve plea talks, the terms of any agreement \\u201Crequired extensive review and approval at various levels of government necessitating more time than usual to approve and negotiate.\\u201D The government asked the judge to suspend deadlines in the case for another two weeks \\u201Cto provide additional time to exhaust all avenues of negotiation.\\u201D Schaffer hasn\\u2019t been indicted by a federal grand jury and Baset wrote that keeping Schaffer\\u2019s case in its current position would help move along the plea talks. If plea talks failed, Baset added in a footnote, \\u201Cthe government is in a position to rapidly obtain an indictment\\u201D against him. As prosecutors noted in their original criminal complaint against Schaffer, he has long been open about his anti-government views. In a 2017 interview, according to prosecutors, he referred to the federal government as a \\u201Ccriminal enterprise.\\u201D In the fall of 2020, at the \\u201CMillion MAGA March\\u201D he gave an interview in which he declared: \\u201CIf somebody wants to bring violence, I think there\\u2019s a lot of us here that are ready for it.

It\\u2019s time to usher in a new generation of progressive leadership into the Democratic Party.\\u201D Kelly\\u2019s early campaign mirrors those that have been successful for Justice Democrats in recent years, after the group helped skyrocket Ocasio-Cortez to victory over former Rep. Jim Crowley in 2018. In 2020, the group had similar successes with Reps. Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush, who knocked off former Democratic Reps. Eliot Engel and Lacy Clay. Several other high profile challengers, including Kara Eastman in Nebraska, Alex Morse in Massachusetts, and Jessica Cisneros in Texas, came close but ultimately fell short. \\u201CThe biggest thing I\\u2019ve taken from other Justice Democrats candidates is the validation of what we feel as everyday regular people is correct,\\u201D Kelly said.

Kelly said that she specifies not just the Green New Deal (which she called \\u201Chip hop to Congress compared to a lot of the old songs we\\u2019ve been playing\\u201D), but Green New Deal union jobs for a reason. \\u201CThe union has been a way for us to [have] a pathway out of poverty,\\u201D she said. \\u201CAnd it\\u2019s a way for us to do it again.\\u201D Cooper is a member of the conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. In a press release Monday, Justice Democrats branded Cooper as \\u201CRepublican-lite\\u201D and hit him for supporting the Balanced Budget Amendment as recently as 2019, which would cut funding for safety net programs, as well as 2012 legislation to raise the Social Security age and cut Medicare and Medicaid. He was, as the group noted, one of just 11 Democrats who voted against former President Barack Obama\\u2019s stimulus package in 2009.

Roberto Minuta, 36, of Prosper, Texas, and Joshua James, 33, of Arab, Alabama, were arrested and charged in March but indicted by a federal grand jury on Wednesday, along with 10 others associated with the Oath Keepers who have already been charged in the conspiracy. The new indictment also reveals that, in the hours before the Capitol was breached, Minuta, James, and another unidentified individual, known in the indictment as \\u201CPerson Ten,\\u201D had a series of phone calls with Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes. Rhodes, who was in Washington, DC, on the day of the riot, did not enter the Capitol and has not been charged.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a US Capitol Police officer following the riot. Garret Miller is charged not only with participating in the insurrection and resisting officers at the Capitol but also with making a string of threats in the hours and days that followed. In response to a tweet from Ocasio-Cortez on Jan. 6 about impeaching former president Donald Trump, Miller replied, \\u201CAssassinate AOC.\\u201D He later sent a series of messages via different social media platforms threatening to lynch the as-yet-unidentified US Capitol Police officer who fatally shot Ashli Babbitt during the insurrection. Miller believed that the officer is Black, according to a new court filing from prosecutors earlier this week, and his messages about the officer included \\u201CHe\\u2019s a prize to be taken\\u201D and \\u201CHe will swing. . . . I had a rope in my bag on that day.\\u201D Capitol Police have not disclosed any information about the officer to date. \\u201CWe going to get a hold of him and hug his neck with a nice rope,\\u201D Miller wrote in a Facebook chat on Jan. 18, according to the government.Black Capitol Police officers described the racist threats and abuse they faced from the largely white crowd of insurrectionists that descended on the Capitol on Jan. 6, including repeatedly being called the n-word. Earlier this week, two Black Capitol Police officers filed a civil lawsuit against Trump, arguing he was personally responsible for inciting the riot; both officers sustained physical and emotional injuries, and one \\u201Clost count\\u201D of how many times he was called racial slurs by rioters, according to the complaint. Miller has been in custody since he was arrested on Jan. 20, and earlier this month had asked a judge to reconsider a federal magistrate judge\\u2019s original detention order and to release him pending trial. At a hearing on Thursday, Miller\\u2019s lawyer F. Clinton Broden argued that although Miller\\u2019s post-insurrection messages were \\u201Ctroubling,\\u201D there were strict release conditions that could ensure the safety of the community, such as placing him on house arrest and 24-hour monitoring. He also noted that Miller wasn\\u2019t charged with assaulting police or using weapons during the riot and hadn\\u2019t acted on any of his online threats before he was arrested. US District Judge Carl Nichols denied Miller\\u2019s request and ordered him to stay in jail, giving special weight to Miller\\u2019s \\u201Cspecifically formulated and articulated plans\\u201D to track down and kill a Capitol Police officer. In announcing the decision immediately after hearing arguments, Nichols read aloud some of the threatening messages that the government had quoted in its brief advocating to keep Miller behind bars. Nichols said that it was true that Miller wasn\\u2019t charged with the same level of violence as some people arrested after Jan. 6, but the evidence also showed he wasn\\u2019t \\u201Csuddenly swept up\\u201D in the crowd that day. The government presented Facebook messages that Miller sent before Jan. 6 where he discussed bringing tactical gear \\u2014 including a bulletproof vest and a grappling hook \\u2014 and guns to DC; there\\u2019s no evidence he actually brought firearms to the Capitol and he isn\\u2019t charged with that. The government had also argued that Miller\\u2019s messages and conduct after Jan. 6 showed no remorse for participating in the insurrection. When he was arrested, according to court filings, he was wearing a T-shirt with a picture of Trump along with the text \\u201CTake America Back\\u201D and \\u201CI Was There, Washington D.C., January 6, 2021.\\u201D The vast majority of people charged with joining the mob of hundreds of Trump supporters who descended on the Capitol have been allowed to go home while their cases are pending. Prosecutors have focused detention fights on cases that involve assaults on police officers, destruction of property, and allegations that people took a leadership role and conspired in advance to commit violence or disrupt Congress from certifying the results of the presidential election. The US attorney\\u2019s office in Washington, which is prosecuting the Jan. 6 cases, faced a recent setback in its efforts to keep some defendants in jail \\u2014 the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit issued a decision last week that made it harder for prosecutors to win pretrial detention in cases that don\\u2019t involve specific allegations of violent activity and an ongoing threat to the community. Broden cited that ruling on Thursday, as a number of defendants challenging their detention have done in the days that followed, but it ultimately didn\\u2019t help Miller\\u2019s case.

A woman identified as a fifth victim was hospitalized. Police first received a report of shots fired around 5:30 p.m. at a two-story business complex, Lt. Jennifer Amat, a spokesperson for the Orange Police Department, told reporters. When officers arrived at the scene, they were initially unable to enter the building courtyard because the gates on both the north and south sides had been locked from the inside with a bicycle-type cable lock, Amat said. Two officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect from outside the gates.After forcing entry into the courtyard, officers found the suspect, who had sustained a gunshot wound, and two victims, including the 9-year-old boy, who was dead. An adult woman, who had also been shot, was found with the boy and taken to a local hospital, as was the suspect. Both the victim and the suspect remained in critical condition as of Thursday morning, Amat said. During a subsequent search of the complex, officers located three additional victims \\u2014 two adult women and one adult man \\u2014 who were all deceased. Those three victims were located in suites that are part of Unified Homes, a real estate company that specializes in dealing mobile homes. No other businesses at the complex were affected by the shooting, Amat said. Amat said officials recovered a semiautomatic handgun as well as a backpack, which they believe belonged to the suspect, containing pepper spray, handcuffs, and ammunition.The suspect, identified as Aminadab Gaxiola Gonzalez, 44, of Fullerton, California, is believed to have known all the victims. Amat said police believe the preliminary motive is related to a business and personal relationship between the suspect and the victims. \\u201CThis was not a random act of violence,\\u201D she told reporters during a briefing Thursday morning. She added that the child is believed to be the son of one of the victims who worked at the business. Officials believe the woman victim who was found in the courtyard with the boy was his mother, though that relationship is still under investigation. \\u201CIt appears that a little boy died in his mother\\u2019s arms as she was trying to save him during this horrific massacre,\\u201D Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said. Family members identified the victims on GoFundMe as Luis Tovar, 50, his daughter Genevieve Raygoza, 28, Leticia Solis, and 9-year-old Matthew Farias. The boy's mother, Blanca Tamayo, was identified as the surviving victim who is being treated at the hospital. \\u201CWe are still in shock and trying to fathom and grasp our heads around this tragic event,\\u201D the GoFundMe said. \\u201CPlease keep all of us affected in your prayers, including our loved one who is still fighting for her life in critical condition.\\u201DSpitzer said that because there were multiple victims the suspect is eligible for the death penalty. He added that his office will also be evaluating whether the suspect was lying in wait, another circumstance that would make him eligible for death, by apparently locking the courtyard gates. Gonzalez has been charged with four counts of murder, one count of attempted murder, and two counts of attempted murder of a police officer, the district attorney's office announced Friday. \\u201CIt is a horrible, horrible tragedy that Mr. Gonzalez made a decision to use deadly force to deal with issues he was dealing with, apparently, in his life,\\u201D Spitzer said. \\u201CBut he will suffer and face the consequences.\\u201D The Orange shooting is being described as the worst in the city in nearly 24 years. \\u201CI can tell you that we haven\\u2019t had an incident like this in the city of Orange since 1997,\\u201D Amat said. \\u201CIt\\u2019s just such a tragedy for the victims, their families, our community, and our police department.\\u201D \\u201CI\\u2019m deeply saddened by reports of a mass shooting in Orange County, and I\\u2019m continuing to keep victims and their loved ones in my thoughts as we continue to learn more. My team and I will continue to monitor the situation closely,\\u201D Rep. Katie Porter, whose district includes part of Orange, tweeted.California Gov. Gavin Newsom also tweeted out condolences, calling the shooting \\u201Chorrifying and heartbreaking.\\u201DThe incident comes on the heels of mass shootings in Georgia and Colorado in the last two weeks.

Tuesday\\u2019s ruling from a federal district judge in New York only affects the campaign\\u2019s ability to enforce a contract that former staffer Jessica Denson signed in 2016. But Denson filed the case as a class action, and her lawyers can now argue to extend the decision to apply to anyone who worked on the 2016 campaign and signed the same agreement. US District Judge Paul Gardephe found that nondisclosure and nondisparagement clauses in the 2016 campaign\\u2019s employment agreement that restricted what staffers could share publicly \\u2014 not just about the campaign but also about Trump, his family members, and his businesses \\u2014 were too vaguely worded and ill-defined to be enforceable. The language was \\u201Cunduly burdensome\\u201D and chilled Denson and other former staffers from speaking out about \\u201Cmatters of public interest,\\u201D the judge wrote. \\u201CIt is difficult if not impossible for Denson or another Campaign employee to know whether any speech might be covered by one of the broad categories of restricted information; whether that speech might relate to one of the several hundred potential subjects of the non-disclosure provision; or whether that speech may relate to a matter that President Trump will determine is confidential,\\u201D Gardephe wrote. It\\u2019s not clear if staffers working on Trump\\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign were required to sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) \\u2014 Trump\\u2019s post-presidency office and the campaign\\u2019s attorneys didn\\u2019t return a request for comment. But should Trump run for office again, the latest decision in Denson\\u2019s case at minimum serves as a warning against requiring staffers to sign contracts that indefinitely bar them from speaking about a broad range of subjects regarding Trump, his businesses, and his family. \\u201CToday\\u2019s beautiful ruling rebukes this unmitigated censorship, and I am so grateful that my years of trial have resulted in this illegal roadblock to transparency, accountability, and justice being struck down,\\u201D Denson said in a statement. Trump isn\\u2019t the only candidate to use NDAs, which can vary in terms of how broadly they limit what staffers and volunteers can talk about in public. In early 2020, the Nation reported that Michael Bloomberg\\u2019s presidential campaign had staffers sign NDAs; a campaign spokesperson said at the time that the agreements only covered campaign strategies and plans and wouldn\\u2019t bar someone from talking about harassment. Last month, former presidential candidate Andrew Yang\\u2019s campaign in the New York City mayoral race announced it would no longer ask volunteers to sign NDAs after facing public backlash. Trump had a history of requiring his employees to sign NDAs before he became president, according to the Associated Press, and carried the practice not only into his 2016 campaign, but also to the White House. NBC News reported last year that when Trump made a surprise visit in 2019 to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, he required doctors and staff involved in treating him to sign NDAs; two physicians refused to sign and were not allowed to see him. The article noted that privacy laws already barred medical service providers from sharing personal health information. Denson has been fighting with the Trump campaign for more than three years over the agreement she signed in 2016. The campaign hired Denson as a national phone bank administrator in August 2016, and she was later promoted to director of Hispanic engagement. She was required to sign an employment agreement that barred her from sharing \\u201Cconfidential information\\u201D or publicly disparaging Trump, his companies, or his family members. The agreement included a section that stated that if a dispute came up related to those terms, Trump or his family members had the right to take it to private arbitration instead of having it litigated in public court proceedings. In November 2017, Denson filed a lawsuit against the Trump campaign in state court in New York, claiming she\\u2019d been discriminated against and harassed by other campaign officials and had faced a hostile work environment; she didn\\u2019t lodge claims against Trump himself. What followed were a string of cases brought by Denson and the campaign against one another in arbitration, state court, and federal court. The campaign accused Denson of violating the nondisclosure and nondisparagement clauses of the employment agreement by filing her original lawsuit. An arbitrator sided with the campaign and ordered Denson to pay nearly $50,000, but in February 2020, after several more rounds in court, an appeals court in New York tossed out the arbitrator\\u2019s award to the campaign. Denson brought a class action that challenged the validity of the employment agreement itself, arguing that the campaign couldn\\u2019t enforce it against anyone who signed it, not just her. In Tuesday\\u2019s ruling, Gardephe rejected the campaign\\u2019s argument that Denson lacked standing to bring the case and claim that the agreement was unlawfully restricting her right to speak publicly about Trump and the campaign. The judge noted that Denson\\u2019s fears of facing legal consequences for speaking out weren\\u2019t abstract, given the number of times Trump or a campaign official tried to enforce or threatened to enforce nondisclosure and nondisparagement agreements over the past four years involving former campaign and White House staffers, including agreements with Omarosa Manigault Newman, Cliff Sims, and Alva Johnson. Lawyers for the campaign had argued that Denson couldn\\u2019t show that she faced any real risk because she\\u2019d criticized Trump on social media in recent years and the campaign hadn\\u2019t taken legal action against her. But Gardephe found that wasn\\u2019t enough to overcome the campaign\\u2019s \\u201Cpattern\\u201D of trying to enforce such agreements against Denson and other ex-staffers. Gardephe wrote that Trump and the campaign\\u2019s previous threats and legal claims showed that it was \\u201Cnot operating in good faith to protect what it has identified as legitimate interests,\\u201D but instead had tried \\u201Cto suppress speech that it finds detrimental to its interests.\\u201D"},{"author":"Zahra Hirji","title":"Biden\u2019s Infrastructure Plan Is No Green New Deal, Left Says","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/zahrahirji\/biden-infrastructure-plan-green-new-deal","content":"President Joe Biden on Wednesday proposed spending more than $2 trillion to overhaul the nation\\u2019s aging infrastructure, from roads to water pipelines and electric grids, in a way that tackles climate change and creates jobs. The proposal\\u2019s shared focus on cutting pollution, supporting vulnerable populations, and generating new jobs echoes the core tenets of the Green New Deal resolution championed by the Democrats Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. But progressive politicians and climate groups say Biden\\u2019s plan falls far short of the Green New Deal, which proposes the US hit net-zero emissions by 2030. Biden\\u2019s plan, they say, doesn\\u2019t dedicate nearly enough money as necessary. \\u201CIt is imperative that we act on a once-in-a-generation opportunity to use our governing majorities and build on the success of the landmark $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan,\\u201D Congressional Progressive Caucus chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal said in a statement shortly before Biden rolled out his plan on Wednesday, in a speech in Pittsburgh. \\u201CIt makes little sense to narrow his previous ambition on infrastructure or compromise with the physical realities of climate change.\\u201D Organizers and congressional offices who spoke with BuzzFeed News said that they were encouraged by some of the initiatives included in the plan but that it doesn\\u2019t go nearly far enough. \\u201CI think it\\u2019s a step towards our vision of a Green New Deal,\\u201D Ellen Sciales, a spokesperson for the youth climate group Sunrise Movement, told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CBut the truth is this does not meet the scale and the scope of what we need to meet the true scale and urgency of the climate crisis.\\u201D This is just Biden\\u2019s latest climate move, following the US rejoining the Paris climate agreement, pausing new oil and gas leasing on public lands, and creating high-level climate roles, task forces, and committees across the federal government. Those earlier moves were executive orders largely focused on the steps Biden could take alone. In contrast, \\u201CThe American Jobs Plan\\u201D is a proposal for Congress to green-light grants, tax breaks, job creation programs, and more to help the public, especially disadvantaged communities, prepare for and respond to the climate crisis. \\u201CThe plan targets 40% of the benefits of climate and clean infrastructure investments to disadvantaged communities,\\u201D according to a White House fact sheet. \\u201CAnd, the plan invests in rural communities and communities impacted by the market-based transition to clean energy.\\u201D One congressional office pointed to the plan\\u2019s focus on targeting benefits toward disadvantaged communities, calling it encouraging. \\u201CIt demonstrates that the White House is listening, but the next step is to make sure that the scale meets where we\\u2019re at,\\u201D Maurice Mitchell, the director of the Working Families Party, told BuzzFeed News about the plan\\u2019s focus on those communities. \\u201CIf these were regular times, then the scale of the bill would probably meet the needs of regular times. These are not regular times.\\u201D Under the proposal, the US would expand tax credits for clean energy generation and storage; invest $10 billion to launch a Climate Conservation Corps to employ people to conserve public lands and boost climate resilience; put $16 billion toward supporting jobs to plug abandoned oil and gas wells; allocate $174 billion to expand the US electric vehicle market, including setting a target of building 500,000 electric vehicle chargers by the end of the decade; and devote $45 billion to replace every lead pipe and service line across the country. If passed by Congress and signed into law, this plan would dramatically expand the money going into US climate resilience, pollution cleanup, conservation, electrification, and energy efficiency. And groups like the Sunrise Movement see many pieces of this proposal, including the inclusion of a Climate Conservation Corps, as a big win. \\u201CWe think it\\u2019s historic,\\u201D Sciales told BuzzFeed News. Still, the Sunrise Movement and other progressives don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s historic enough. Congressional staffers for progressives in the House and Senate told BuzzFeed News that while the plan encompasses some of what\\u2019s laid out in various Green New Deal plans, the amount of money it dedicates is not close to what they\\u2019ve had in mind. \\u201CIs it the amount we want to see invested? Not quite,\\u201D said one aide to a progressive senator, who asked not to be named while the White House is just starting to roll its plan out. \\u201CThere\\u2019s still room to push for more, and that\\u2019s what progressives do.\\u201DDemocrats have introduced a number of separate bills in recent weeks that would push more funding toward infrastructure and climate change. For example, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Andy Levin introduced a green procurement that would fund purchases of sustainable American-made products. They also joined others in Congress to introduce the Build Green Act, which would invest $500 billion over the next decade to modernize infrastructure and transition the country to electric public vehicles and rail. The Congressional Progressive Caucus on Monday introduced the THRIVE Act, proposing $10 trillion on infrastructure spending. The agenda, which was first introduced last year by former representative and current Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, has been sponsored by a large coalition of congressional Democrats. The Green New Deal Network \\u2014 a coalition of organizations including the Working Families Party, the Sunrise Movement, the NAACP, and the Sierra Club \\u2014 announced that they would pressure Biden and senators to incorporate the THRIVE agenda into the recovery plan with nationwide actions. One senior administration official told reporters that the plan reflected Biden\\u2019s commitment to meet the moment and show that the United States \\u201Ccould deliver.\\u201D \\u201CWe can demonstrate to the American people that the type of historic and galvanizing public investment programs we\\u2019ve had in the past but have not seen it in earnest since the creation of the interstate highway system and the space race in the1960s can revive, revitalize our national imagination, and put millions of Americans to work,\\u201D the official said on a briefing call with reporters on Tuesday night. Asked by BuzzFeed News if the plan approached a Green New Deal on Wednesday morning, a Biden official said, \\u201CNo. It\\u2019s the American Jobs Plan.\\u201D"},{"author":"Katherine Miller","title":"The Pandemic Is Ending.

The future-free year: Nobody knew exactly when the dire situation would end or how, so there couldn\\u2019t quite be the reasonable expectation of what would come next, in which x and y choices, sacrifices, and calculations would deliver z in the future, or feel worth it, like you\\u2019d made the smart call. We all sacrifice in the present for the future: That\\u2019s human nature and good business sense. But you can see this idea of the optimized future shaping elements of entertainment, business, and culture. Disney and Marvel built a 23-movie enterprise that\\u2019s become the predominant shared cultural property \\u2014 one in which each element leaves you spiritually hanging, waiting for the next property to deliver on the promise of the setup. Uber turned taxis into a domination pursuit where eventually, theoretically, its scale would crush all competitors, and profits would pour forth. Pro baseball and basketball teams seem even more willing to tank games or trade away the present for future assets; both games have totally reshaped themselves chasing a new understanding of statistical efficiency. Despite being the real channels through which life and business get conducted, Twitter, Instagram, etc., feel \\u2014 on some level \\u2014 temporary, like a phase everyone's going through before we get back to real biz. The underpinning of that middle-distant future is the idea\\\/reality that there\\u2019s a subterranean level of data flowing all around us. Since the publication of Michael Lewis\\u2019s 2003 book Moneyball brought advanced baseball analytics to a wider audience, iPhones have turned each of us into walking box scores, interacting daily with platforms that have brought business metrics to a wider audience. The data\\u2019s just waiting to be bottled up and turned into better analytics that will explain the past, reveal the present, identify market inefficiencies, and help forecast the future. Today is merely part of the great A\\\/B test in the sky. Then the pandemic dropped a concrete wall between the present and the \\u201Cafter.\\u201D This isn\\u2019t like one of those The Secret, Precious Gift of This Period arguments, where you would see a single word adorned with flowers in a pink Instagram frame. There are obviously no secret, precious gifts given by the pandemic, which will hopefully be the worst thing to ever happen to so many of us. The pandemic was like jamming ice picks in a glacier that\\u2019s already sinking. We all know we\\u2019re never getting that year back; it\\u2019s just gone. And maybe prior to the pandemic, you were living linearly in the present, in which each decision existed in the sparse echo of its own weight, one thing leading mysteriously to the next. But for a segment of the population, and arguably in some of our business affairs, some of us lived in the present in part as a service to the future. In that light, where the moving parts of people\\u2019s lives stalled for a year, the ethos of an optimized future where the economy would finish changing and the disruption would end sounds absolutely ridiculous. The idea of a baseball team waiting for five years from now to win, or trading their star player for prospects; or a company achieving such scale that the economics will finally make sense; or one of these apps that employs contract workers who don\\u2019t make much, for a company that doesn\\u2019t make money, against small businesses who also lose out... What are we doing here? When we live in a world where we might just lose a year of our lives? Fewer than 100 days into a new presidency, MSNBC has a reporter in Iowa with \\u201CDECISION 2024\\u201D on the screen! It\\u2019s ludicrous. Even casting aside more utopian aims, what exactly are we doing in the present if we\\u2019re not even winning games and making money? While trying to articulate this admittedly nebulous feeling about the present vs. the future, I ended up reading about Uber and Instagram, a baseball team, a basketball team, a novel about lying, a memoir about Silicon Valley, and The Innovator\\u2019s Dilemma, one of the business texts behind the economics of disruptive technology. In that last book, originally published in 1997, the late Clayton Christensen argued that strong businesses thrive on sustaining technology \\u2014 the little advances that improve the products you already use \\u2014 and those same businesses miss the disruptive technology that destroys them. Disruptive technology creates new markets, usually with just-good-enough technology pitched toward a new need. Good management wasn\\u2019t any help; good management responded to the paying customer rather than anticipating a nonexistent market at lower margins. Successful companies set up companies within to resist those pressures and seek out new markets. Twenty years later, the book offers a lesson on the relative nature of The Future: Many of the case studies concern the disk-drive industry of the 1980s and \\u201990s during the development of the desktop computers that nobody much owns anymore. Other chapters tell the story of discount retailers like Kmart cutting into the business of Sears; in 2021, the vacant, old Sears properties are serving as vaccination sites. Christensen writes of inkjet printers and the personal digital assistants that preceded smartphones, objects that you can imagine disappearing from a house with little pops. Case study: the temporary nature of triumph. Case study: inevitability. Case study: standing in the ocean and trying to fight the waves. \\u201CNot only are the market applications of disruptive technologies unknown at the time of their development,\\u201D he writes, \\u201Cthey are unknowable.\\u201D You usually can\\u2019t see the end. It\\u2019s weird, though: As millions of vaccinations roll on, we might arrive at an actual, observable ending. One day soon, hopefully, suddenly, we\\u2019ll be ourselves after the pandemic. You can feel that chaotic pulse running now as more and more people get vaccinated. Opening your phone can be like opening and closing a door to find: a person crying for unclear reasons, then two people in hysterics, then one despondent, then one celebrating their vaccination. The world's like boats waiting in the locks. Who knows, exactly, what any of us will be like after a lost year. You might let the pandemic year slip under the waves and return to the way you were, or go hard this summer, or live more fully but quietly, or get stuck behind in the mental prism of the pandemic, or oscillate between different states. For the rest of our lives, once there\\u2019s really an ending (and who knows exactly when it will be deemed Over), we\\u2019ll read aggregate studies of and data points about how health, education, and business changed throughout the pandemic, and what COVID-19 did to this country. But could the most advanced analytics explain what happened to you during the pandemic? If you and I were baseball players or presidential candidates, there would be a set of metrics, regressed into a series of complicated analytics with a singular value about what I\\u2019d contributed, and maybe a public-facing forecast about how we\\u2019ll do post-pandemic. You\\u2019d be able to track where a model of six factors and ancestral data about how those similar to myself have performed after a year of their life disappears. To get weirder with it, if I were a tech company or a social media platform, like the actual entity, you\\u2019d consider whether there remained more growth for me or whether I\\u2019d fall away, washed by new disruption and a market inefficiency I\\u2019d left untended. And this is where I could write one of those bloodless dirges about how tech\\u2019s turning everything the same, and with it, a little bit worse. I don\\u2019t rigidly believe that, because that argument sometimes runs along highbrow lines (drones lining up to take the same, monotonous Instagram photo), when in reality a lot of people are just having some fun (taking goofy photos with friends, watching superhero movies). But just as athletes and politicians are living humans who can mean so much more than they do in a statistical model, you wouldn\\u2019t want your life or livelihood to exist solely on paper, or only within the box of your phone, pegged endlessly to your future potential. But for a time, the entire machine broke down and one could see the ways in which living with a foot in the future (whether in how it will look on the phone, or toward the metrics, or toward a jackpot profit that nobody really believes an unsustainable business will produce) saps some real life and logic out of the present. And since only the present is guaranteed \\u2014 since things can end without you even knowing it \\u2014 you want as much life and logic as possible, all the time. So, then, on this one front alone, the pandemic is like when a passing car\\u2019s window catches the sun and blinds you \\u2014 temporary, painful, and vivid \\u2014 before your vision returns to normal. ●"},{"author":"Zoe Tillman","title":"Lawsuits Against Trump Are Stacking Up Over Capitol Riot","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/zoetillman\/trump-lawsuits-capitol-riot-police","content":"WASHINGTON \\u2014 Lawsuits seeking to hold former president Donald Trump personally \\u2014 and financially \\u2014 responsible for the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6 are stacking up. This week, two US Capitol Police officers who said they were on the front lines at the Capitol on Jan. 6 sued Trump, arguing that he was liable for inciting the violence and for the physical and emotional injuries they sustained during clashes with rioters. There are already two lawsuits filed by Democratic members of Congress \\u2014 Reps. Bennie Thompson and Eric Swalwell \\u2014 that accuse Trump and his allies of conspiring to interfere with their official duties by pushing the false claims of voter fraud that underpinned the Capitol insurrection. A fourth case, filed a few weeks before the January riot, accuses Trump and Republicans of violating federal civil rights law by focusing postelection challenges and fraud falsehoods on areas with large Black populations. Trump has denied that he was responsible for inciting the violence of Jan. 6, and his defense against these cases is likely to feature an argument that his promotion of the \\u201CStop the Steal\\u201D campaign \\u2014 the lie that President Joe Biden\\u2019s win was illegitimate and that there was widespread fraud \\u2014 was political speech protected by the First Amendment. His lawyers haven\\u2019t filed responses yet to the post\\u2013Jan. 6 cases, but they\\u2019ve already raised a First Amendment defense in the postelection civil rights case filed on behalf of Black voters. There\\u2019s more potential legal fallout from \\u201CStop the Steal\\u201D looming over Trump. Earlier this week, a lawyer for Dominion Voting Systems told Axios that the election tech company hadn\\u2019t ruled out suing Trump or anyone else who promoted false claims that Dominion and its products were involved in an election fraud scheme. Dominion and another voting systems company, Smartmatic, have already filed billion-dollar lawsuits against Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell, and Fox News. In the case filed in federal district court in Washington, DC, on Wednesday, longtime Capitol Police officers James Blassingame and Sidney Hemby alleged that Trump \\u201Cinflamed, encouraged, incited, directed, and aided and abetted\\u201D his supporters who rioted on Jan. 6. They pointed to the weeks of postelection tweets and public remarks from Trump claiming the election was stolen and promoting demonstrations before Jan. 6 that had turned violent. They noted a tweet that Trump sent early on Jan. 6 urging Republicans to \\u201CFIGHT!\\u201D as well as his speech at the \\u201CStop the Steal\\u201D rally just before the riot began when he said, \\u201Cif you don\\u2019t fight like hell, you\\u2019re not going to have a country anymore.\\u201D Blassingame and Hemby were worried about the size of the crowds assembling near the Capitol when they reported to work on Jan. 6, according to their lawsuit, but weren\\u2019t briefed about what to expect. Trump supporters had spent weeks planning for Jan. 6 and talking about the potential for violence on public social media platforms, but Capitol Police officials testified before Congress after the insurrection that they weren\\u2019t prepared for the size of the crowd and the violence that followed. Capitol Police officials aren\\u2019t named as defendants in the case along with Trump. A lawyer for Blassingame and Hemby, Patrick Malone, told BuzzFeed News in an email that the lawsuit \\u201Cis focused on the instigator of the violence, not on those who in hindsight might have mitigated some of the harm.\\u201D Trump didn\\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment via his post-presidency office, and a lawyer who is representing him in other postelection cases, Jesse Binnall, declined to comment. The lawsuit described how a \\u201Ctidal wave of insurrectionists \\u2026 quickly outnumbered\\u201D the officers stationed outside of the Capitol. Rioters \\u201Ccrushed\\u201D Hemby against a door as they tried to get inside, and hit him and sprayed him with chemical irritants \\u2014 he was bleeding from a cut below his eye and had \\u201Ccuts and abrasions\\u201D all over his body. Blassingame, meanwhile, was inside the building and the small group of officers he was with were overwhelmed as rioters streamed through windows and doors, according to the complaint. He was \\u201Cslammed\\u201D into a stone column by a \\u201Cforceful surge,\\u201D and rioters repeatedly hit him with fists, flagpoles, and other weapons. Blassingame and Hemby are Black, and the lawsuit described how Blassingame \\u201Clost count\\u201D of how many times rioters called him a racial slur. Black officers have previously described facing an outpouring of racist attacks on Jan. 6. \\u201CForemost in Officer Blassingame\\u2019s mind was the terrifying certainty that the insurrectionists were interested in him and the other officers not going home to their families that night,\\u201D the lawsuit states. He eventually moved away from the mob and was involved in helping members of Congress evacuate to another part of the Capitol. The lawsuit notes that some people around him weren\\u2019t following COVID-19 protocols as far as wearing masks or social distancing, but he had to stay where he was; the complaint didn\\u2019t say that he ever tested positive for the disease. The lawsuit states that in addition to their physical injuries that day, both officers struggled with emotional and mental health problems in the weeks that followed. Blassingame \\u201Cis haunted by the memory of being attacked, and of the sensory impacts \\u2013 the sights, sounds, smells and even tastes of the attack remain close to the surface,\\u201D the lawsuit states. \\u201CHe experiences guilt of being unable to help his colleagues who were simultaneously being attacked; and of surviving where other colleagues did not.\\u201D One thing the latest lawsuit has in common with those filed by Thompson and Swalwell, besides arguing Trump is responsible for the violence, is that they quote Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who joined the vast majority of his Republican colleagues in voting to acquit Trump of impeachment charges brought by House Democrats that he incited the violence. At the time, McConnell said that Trump was \\u201Cpractically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day\\u201D and suggested he could still face civil lawsuits or even criminal prosecution. Attorney General Merrick Garland testified at his Senate confirmation hearing in February that he would pursue leads in connection with the criminal investigation into the insurrection \\u201Cwherever they take us,\\u201D but didn\\u2019t commit to investigating any particular person. Trump and other speakers and organizers involved in the \\u201CStop the Steal\\u201D rally on Jan. 6 that preceded the riot have not been criminally charged to date. The Capitol Police officers\\u2019 complaint did pull quotes from criminal cases that have been brought against people charged with participating in the insurrection who said they stormed the Capitol at Trump\\u2019s direction. Trump has been taken to court over violence by his supporters before. In 2016, anti-Trump protesters sued then-candidate Trump after they were assaulted by Trump supporters at a campaign rally in Louisville, Kentucky. The plaintiffs argued that Trump was responsible for the actions of his supporters because he had repeatedly said, \\u201Cget \\u2019em out of here,\\u201D in response to the protests. A district court judge tossed some of the claims against Trump but ruled that the incitement allegation could go forward. In June 2018, a federal appeals court reversed the lower court judge and dismissed the claim, concluding that because Trump \\u201Cdid not specifically advocate imminent lawless action,\\u201D his comments of \\u201Cget \\u2018em out of here\\u201D were protected by the First Amendment. The court noted that Trump had also said, \\u201CDon\\u2019t hurt \\u2019em.\\u201D That decision, from the US Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, isn\\u2019t binding on federal judges in Washington. During Trump\\u2019s second impeachment trial in February, both sides argued over the significance of a 1969 decision by the US Supreme Court, Brandenburg v. Ohio, that drew a line between \\u201Cmere advocacy\\u201D \\u2014 even if it supported violent acts \\u2014 and \\u201Cincitement to imminent lawless action.\\u201D In the aftermath of Jan. 6, legal experts have split on whether Trump\\u2019s comments, advocacy, and tweets leading up to the insurrection as well as throughout that day would legally be considered incitement."},{"author":"Zoe Tillman","title":"Biden Judge Nominees Mark Push To Diversify Federal Courts","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/zoetillman\/biden-judges-federal-court-diversity","content":"WASHINGTON \\u2014 The White House on Tuesday announced President Joe Biden\\u2019s first slate of federal court nominees, putting forward a list of barrier-breaking candidates in an aggressive first push to counterbalance the wave of conservative judges confirmed over the past four years. As had been widely expected for months, Biden will nominate US District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for the powerful US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, to fill Attorney General Merrick Garland\\u2019s former seat. A post on that court \\u2014 long a springboard to the US Supreme Court \\u2014 cements Jackson\\u2019s status as a frontrunner if a justice steps down under Biden, especially since Biden pledged to choose a Black woman for the high court. As a former public defender and member of the US Sentencing Commission, Jackson\\u2019s nomination also elevates a judge with the kind of diverse professional background that liberals hoped Biden would embrace. The White House announced 10 federal court nominees and one nominee for the District of Columbia Superior Court. Biden\\u2019s other two federal appeals court nominees are, like Jackson, Black women: Tiffany Cunningham, a veteran patent lawyer in Chicago, was tapped for the Federal Circuit, which handles a docket heavy with intellectual property cases. Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, a private practice lawyer in Washington who is also a former public defender, is being nominated for the 7th Circuit. Only eight Black women have served on federal appeals courts, according to federal judiciary records. The list of nominees features several judges who would make history if confirmed to lifetime appointments on the federal bench. US Magistrate Judge Zahid Quraishi, nominated for a federal district court seat in New Jersey, would be the first presidentially appointed Muslim American federal judge. DC Superior Court Judge Florence Pan, nominated for Jackson\\u2019s seat on the DC federal district court, would be the first Asian American woman to serve on that court. Judge Lydia Griggsby of the US Court of Federal Claims, nominated for the federal district court in Maryland, would be the first BIPOC woman on that bench. Liberal advocacy groups launched public pressure campaigns since Biden won in November to make judges a priority and undercut the influence of the more than 200 conservative-leaning judges confirmed under former president Donald Trump. Biden\\u2019s transition team started accepting lists of potential nominees from outside groups, soliciting names from home state senators, and vetting candidates before he took office with an eye to announcing a batch of nominees early in his first year.The White House also made a point of highlighting the professional diversity of nominees \\u2014 liberal groups had urged the administration to broaden the pipelines to the bench and move away from the historic dominance of former prosecutors and corporate lawyers. Tuesday\\u2019s list featured four former public defenders \\u2014 one of whom, Margaret Strickland, nominated for the federal district court in New Mexico, currently has a private civil rights and criminal law practice \\u2014 along with four former assistant US attorneys. Speaking with reporters on background on Tuesday, a senior administration official noted that with 11 nominees, Biden was moving more quickly to fill more seats right away than his immediate predecessors; former presidents Trump and Barack Obama announced their first federal court nominees a few weeks earlier than Biden, but they didn\\u2019t roll out as large a number right out of the gate. Biden faces a steep road to matching the more than 220 federal judges confirmed under Trump, who now make up roughly a quarter of all active judges. New vacancies have steadily opened up since Biden was sworn in, mostly judges who were confirmed under former president Bill Clinton and are now eligible to take what\\u2019s known as senior status, allowing them to have a more flexible caseload while opening up their seat to a new judge. As of Tuesday, there were 100 vacancies nationwide. The federal judiciary\\u2019s policymaking arm has advocated for years for Congress to approve more judgeships across the lower courts and presented a new proposal earlier this month to add 79 more seats. Congress hasn\\u2019t acted on the judiciary\\u2019s requests, and it\\u2019s not clear if the latest push will gain traction \\u2014 it\\u2019s been nearly 20 years since Congress approved any new federal judgeships, and more than 30 years since lawmakers approved a comprehensive overhaul of the bench that included new circuit judgeships. Liberal groups have publicly urged Biden to prioritize judicial nominations to take advantage of the Democratic majority in the Senate, frequently pointing out that Obama\\u2019s slower pace early on gave Republicans an opportunity to block nominees and hold seats open once they regained control. Three of Biden\\u2019s picks had been nominated under Obama for the federal bench but never received final votes in the Senate: Pan, New Jersey federal court nominee Julien Neals, and Colorado federal court nominee Regina Rodriguez. The senior Biden administration official told reporters on Tuesday to expect a \\u201Csteady drumbeat\\u201D of nomination announcements and that the White House would move \\u201Cquickly\\u201D to fill vacancies as seats opened up, but didn\\u2019t provide a specific timeline. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer released a statement saying that the \\u201CSenate will work quickly to confirm President Biden\\u2019s superb and accomplished judicial picks.\\u201D The official said that, as has historically been the practice under Democratic and Republican presidents, the White House would defer to home state senators in considering nominees for the federal district courts, but take a more leading role in choosing nominees for the circuit courts. Appeals courts set precedent and are where a judge\\u2019s ideological background is more likely to make a difference in decisions. Biden\\u2019s priorities are choosing nominees with strong qualifications and whose backgrounds \\u2014 both demographically and professionally \\u2014 represent the \\u201Cfull diversity\\u201D of the public and the legal profession, the official said. There was a chorus of statements from liberal advocacy groups praising the historic diversity of Biden\\u2019s first batch of nominees. Brian Fallon, executive director of Demand Justice, one of the groups that has publicly urged Biden to choose more professionally diverse judges, put out a statement saying Tuesday\\u2019s announcement represented a \\u201Cwelcome shift\\u201D in terms of prioritizing judicial nominations. But he also expressed disappointment that not all of the nominees came from \\u201Cunderrepresented\\u201D backgrounds, such as public defender offices and civil rights practices, saying that \\u201Cold habits die hard for some senators who are used to recommending corporate lawyers and prosecutors.\\u201D \\u201CWe know Biden's stated preference for civil rights lawyers and labor lawyers for district courts is only as good as the buy-in it generates among home-state senators. This means progressives need to double down on pressuring these senators, and that is what we intend to do in the months ahead,\\u201D Fallon said. Two Latino civil rights groups criticized the fact that just one of the 11 names on Biden's first list, Rodriguez, is from the Latino community. Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Juan Cartagena, president and general counsel of LatinoJustice PRLDEF, said in a joint statement that they were \\\"extremely disappointed\\\" with the Biden administration. \\u201CAs the nation\\u2019s largest minority group, with substantial projected growth nationwide, Latinos have been playing and will play an increasing role in our nation\\u2019s legal system, litigating many of the most important legal issues that will arise across the country in every area of law. There is no excuse for perpetuating the exclusion of Latino jurists from the federal bench. Five of the 13 federal circuit courts of appeals have no Latino or Latina active judges, and the all-important D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has never had a Latino or Latina judge in its entire history,\\\" Saenz and Cartagena said. In response to the statement from Saenz and Cartagena, a White House spokesperson told BuzzFeed News in an email that Biden \\\"is committed to ensuring that the federal judiciary reflects the diversity of the country, and that of course includes making sure Latinos are fully represented on the bench.\\\" \\\"We\\u2019ve been in touch with MALDEF and numerous other stakeholders on identifying high-qualified nominees for vacancies and will be rolling out additional candidates in the future,\\\" the spokesperson wrote. The majority of Trump\\u2019s federal court nominees were white and male, something that even sitting judges have spoken out against. At a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee last week, US District Judge Carlton Reeves of Mississippi testified that the \\u201Cpresent trajectory risks a crisis of legitimacy\\u201D on the bench, specifically noting the lack of BIPOC judges on courts that serve parts of the country with higher proportions of Black and Latino residents. \\u201CThese and countless other comparisons reveal a disturbing fact: as our country becomes more diverse, our courts are becoming more homogenous,\\u201D Reeves said. The Trump administration placed an emphasis on choosing younger, conservative-leaning nominees who could make the most of a lifetime appointment. The Biden official told reporters that the White House didn\\u2019t have a litmus test for age but was \\u201Ceager\\u201D to consider nominees in every age bracket, including judges who would join the bench in their thirties. Tuesday\\u2019s list included five nominees in their forties, five nominees in their fifties, and one \\u2014 Judge Rupa Ranga Puttagunta, an administrative law judge in DC nominated for the DC Superior Court \\u2014 who is 39. The Trump administration and Senate Republicans had reached out to judges who were confirmed under previous GOP administrations and eligible to take senior status about stepping down while Trump was in office to maximize their progress on nominations. Asked if the Biden administration would take the same approach, the senior administration official said the White House was focused for now on current vacancies. After four years with an ally in the White House, conservative advocacy groups are redirecting their resources into opposing Biden\\u2019s picks. Carrie Severino of the Judicial Crisis Network tweeted in response to Tuesday\\u2019s announcement that Biden was \\u201Cworking overtime to appease the far left, and we can expect his judges to rubber stamp their extreme radical agenda.\\u201D"},{"author":"Zoe Tillman","title":"Prosecutors Drop Fight To Keep Alleged Capitol Rioters In Jail","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/zoetillman\/capitol-riot-detention-zip-tie-eric-munchel","content":"WASHINGTON \\u2014 Federal prosecutors have dropped a long-standing fight to keep two alleged Capitol rioters in jail, marking one of the highest-profile setbacks for the government in these cases so far. The US attorney\\u2019s office in Washington had spent the past two months arguing to keep Eric Munchel and Lisa Eisenhart behind bars while their cases are pending. In February, a federal judge in DC sided with the government and ordered the mother-son codefendants to stay in jail. But the government notified the judge on Monday that they were backing down; the decision comes three days after a federal appeals court ruled that the DC judge had failed to justify the detention order when the two weren\\u2019t charged with assaulting anyone or destroying property. Munchel \\u2014 who was photographed inside the Capitol wearing tactical gear and carrying plastic zip-tie handcuffs \\u2014 and Eisenhart have been in jail since their arrests on Jan. 10 and Jan. 19, respectively. They\\u2019ll be released to home detention and location monitoring, which is what a federal magistrate judge in their home state of Tennessee originally ordered shortly after their arrests; they\\u2019ll only be allowed to leave home for work, school, medical appointments, religious services, court appearances, and a handful of other preapproved reasons. In exchange for dropping the detention fight, the government also asked that the two be barred from accessing the internet and using encrypted messaging applications without advance approval and that they be prohibited from contacting anyone involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Munchel and Eisenhart agreed to those conditions. Last week\\u2019s decision from the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in Munchel and Eisenhart\\u2019s case set a new precedent that binds all of the federal judges in DC presiding over the Jan. 6 cases. It was the first of the Capitol riot cases to reach the appeals court, and the ruling had immediate ripple effects; hours later, a judge in another Capitol riot case cited it in back-to-back decisions, allowing two members of an alleged conspiracy involving members of the Oath Keepers militant group to go home pending trial. Eisenhart's lawyer Gregory Smith told BuzzFeed News in an email that, \\\"I don\\u2019t think the Court of Appeals\\u2019 decision left the prosecutors with many options, but I am nevertheless pleased we were able to work out an understanding that will finally allow for my client\\u2019s pretrial release.\\\" Munchel's lawyer and a spokesperson for the US attorney\\u2019s office did not immediately return requests for comment. Munchel and Eisenhart are facing a three-count indictment, charging them with trying to obstruct Congress from certifying the results of the presidential election \\u2014 a felony that carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison \\u2014 and two misdemeanor counts for illegally entering the Capitol and disorderly conduct. Prosecutors argued that the fact that the two picked up plastic zip-tie handcuffs they found inside the Capitol was proof they were looking to restrain or kidnap other people there. Prosecutors also pointed to statements the defendants had made before and after going inside about being ready to \\u201Cfuck shit up\\u201D and \\u201Cfight.\\u201D The government could have continued fighting to keep Munchel and Eisenhart in jail following the DC Circuit ruling. In a 2\\u20131 decision, the appeals court sent the case back to US District Judge Royce Lamberth instead of reversing him outright and ordering Munchel and Eisenhart to be freed, giving prosecutors a chance to meet the new standard articulated by the circuit. But in order to successfully reargue for detention, the government would've had to meet a higher bar for proving there were no pretrial release conditions that would keep the community \\u2014 and Congress \\u2014 safe.

In a 2\\u20131 decision, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit ordered a lower court judge to reconsider his decision to keep Eric Munchel and his mother, Lisa Eisenhart, in jail while their cases go forward. US District Judge Royce Lamberth had ruled in February that Munchel \\u2014 who was photographed inside the Capitol wearing tactical gear and holding plastic zip-tie handcuffs \\u2014 and Eisenhart presented \\u201Ca clear danger to our republic\\u201D and that there were no release conditions that would \\u201Creasonably ensure the safety of the community.\\u201D But DC Circuit Judge Robert Wilkins wrote Friday that Lamberth\\u2019s 17-page opinion failed to articulate how the two posed a danger when they hadn\\u2019t actually been charged with committing specific violent acts at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Lamberth wrote that the allegations against Munchel showed that he was \\u201Cwilling to use force to promote his political ends,\\u201D but the appeals court found that the judge didn\\u2019t explain how he reached that conclusion when there was no evidence Munchel hurt anyone or broke anything. \\u201CIn our view, those who actually assaulted police officers and broke through windows, doors, and barricades, and those who aided, conspired with, planned, or coordinated such actions, are in a different category of dangerousness than those who cheered on the violence or entered the Capitol after others cleared the way,\\u201D Wilkins, joined by Judge Judith Rogers, wrote. Munchel and Eisenhart will remain in jail as the case goes back to Lamberth for another round of arguments. Friday\\u2019s opinion marks the first time the appeals court has weighed in with a specific framework for how lower court judges should think about pretrial detention in the Capitol riot cases. The decision sets precedent that is now binding on all of the district court judges in DC and moves the bar higher for the government to successfully argue for pretrial detention for other defendants who, like Munchel and Eisenhart, aren\\u2019t charged with assaulting police, property destruction, or conspiracy and have minimal or no previous criminal record. \\u201CIt cannot be gainsaid that the violent breach of the Capitol on January 6 was a grave danger to our democracy and that those who participated could rightly be subject to detention to safeguard the community,\\u201D Wilkins wrote. \\u201CBut we have a grave constitutional obligation to ensure that the facts and circumstances of each case warrant this exceptional treatment.\\u201D The ripple effect of that ruling could be felt almost immediately after the appeals court released its opinion. In three consecutive detention hearings in the Oath Keepers conspiracy case on Friday, US District Judge Amit Mehta cited the decision, asking both the prosecution and defense to speak to whether it applied to those instances. Ultimately, Mehta granted bond to both Connie Meggs and Donovan Crowl, noting that while both entered the Capitol building along with other Oath Keepers, they did not play a leadership role in planning or carrying out the alleged conspiracy, nor is there evidence that they committed acts of violence. He called Crowl \\u201Ca close call\\u201D and confined him to house arrest until trial. \\u201CWhat the circuit is emphasizing is the question here is a narrow one,\\u201D Mehta said. \\u201CWhat risk does the person pose to an individual or democratic institutions?\\u201D The judge turned to the Munchel ruling a third time to consider Kelly Meggs\\u2019 request for release from jail. The husband of Connie Meggs, he is accused by the prosecution of being a leader of the group of Oath Keepers who pushed their way into the Capitol, and of helping recruit, finance, and organize the events of that day. Encrypted messages and phone records presented by the government show that he was in touch with Oath Keeper leadership, including the group\\u2019s founder, Stewart Rhodes. In addition, prosecutors presented evidence yesterday that the defendant misled the court and the FBI about his participation in firearms training last year. Earlier this month, Kelly Meggs had claimed in a filing that he \\u201Cnever served in the military nor has he undergone any paramilitary training,\\u201D but evidence first published by BuzzFeed News revealed that, in fact, he and his wife had attended two \\u201Cgunfighting\\u201D training sessions run by a former US Marine last year. \\u201CI think Mr. Meggs is in a very different position than the defendants were in Munchel,\\u201D said Mehta, who denied his request for release from jail. \\u201CMr. Meggs has presented as someone who through his words and his deeds and his conduct is someone who is dangerous.\\u201DThe vast majority of the more than 300 people charged in the insurrection have been allowed to go home post-arrest while their cases go forward with no objection from the government. The US attorney\\u2019s office in Washington has mostly focused its requests for detention on cases that involve allegations of assault on police, conspiracy and advance planning, and destruction of property. But in some cases, prosecutors have argued that a defendant\\u2019s actions on Jan. 6 had sufficiently violent overtones or that they\\u2019d made threats of future violence that justified keeping them behind bars. In Munchel and Eisenhart\\u2019s case, prosecutors argued Munchel grabbed the plastic handcuffs after finding them in the Capitol \\u201Ccomprehending that they are instruments of restraint and kidnapping.\\u201D The government cited video that Munchel recorded on Jan. 6 that captured him saying he was \\u201CFucking ready to fuck shit up.\\u201D Lamberth wrote in his February opinion that Eisenhart was \\u201Ca self-avowed, would-be martyr,\\u201D noting that after the riot she gave a media interview in which she said that she would \\u201Crather die as a 57-year-old woman than live under oppression\\u201D and \\u201Cwould rather fight.\\u201D As for the fact that neither defendant was charged with specific violent acts, Lamberth wrote that the \\u201Cportrayal of the alleged offenses as mere trespassing or civil disobedience is both unpersuasive and detached from reality.\\u201D \\u201CStorming the Capitol to disrupt the counting of electoral votes is not the akin to a peaceful sit-in,\\u201D he wrote. But Wilkins wrote that district judges had to consider a defendant\\u2019s dangerousness and potential threat to the community if allowed to go home \\u201Cin context.\\u201D He wrote that Lamberth failed to show how Munchel and Eisenhart posed a danger to Congress going forward \\u201Cnow that the specific circumstances of January 6 have passed.\\u201D \\u201CThe appellants had a unique opportunity to obstruct democracy on January 6 because of the electoral college vote tally taking place that day, and the concurrently scheduled rallies and protests,\\u201D Wilkins wrote. \\u201CBecause Munchel and Eisenhart did not vandalize any property or commit violence, the presence of the group was critical to their ability to obstruct the vote and to cause danger to the community. Without it, Munchel and Eisenhart \\u2014 two individuals who did not engage in any violence and who were not involved in planning or coordinating the activities \\u2014 seemingly would have posed little threat.\\u201D Judge Gregory Katsas wrote a partial dissent, but only to go even farther than his colleagues in saying that he would have ordered pretrial release for Munchel and Eisenhart right away, instead of sending the case back to Lamberth for another round of arguments. A federal magistrate judge had originally agreed to release Munchel and Eisenhart to home confinement with location monitoring, and Katsas wrote that Lamberth \\u201Cgave no plausible explanation for why these stringent conditions would not reasonably ensure public safety.\\u201D \\u201CTheir misconduct was serious, but it hardly threatened to topple the Republic. Nor, for that matter, did it reveal an unmitigable propensity for future violence,\\u201D Katsas wrote. Judges will often reject the suggestion that the party of the president who nominated them has any bearing on their decisions. But the ideological diversity of the panel in Munchel and Eisenhart\\u2019s case \\u2014 which was unanimous in pushing back against the government \\u2014 is notable given the politically charged context around the Capitol insurrection cases. Wilkins was confirmed under former president Barack Obama, Rogers was confirmed under former president Bill Clinton, and Katsas was confirmed under former president Donald Trump. Lawyers for Munchel and Eisenhart and a spokesperson for the US attorney\\u2019s office in DC did not immediately return requests for comment."},{"author":"Ryan Brooks","title":"Biden Press Conference Focused On 2024 But Had No COVID Questions","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/ryancbrooks\/biden-coronavirus-pandemic-2024","content":"In his first formal White House press conference, President Joe Biden was asked repeatedly whether or not he will run for president in three years. He was not asked one question about the ongoing pandemic. Biden started off the press conference with an announcement that his administration was upping its goal to administer 200 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines within his first 100 days in office, up from a goal of 100 million doses set in December. The rest of the press conference focused on issues including changing the Senate\\u2019s rules, voting rights, immigration, and whether Biden saw himself as running for reelection. During the start of the press conference, Biden told reporters that his administration had been focused on \\u201Curgent problems\\u201D like COVID-19 and economic fallout from pandemic-related shutdowns. Reporters quickly moved to questions around other issues before asking whether Biden would run for reelection and why he hadn\\u2019t quickly set up a reelection campaign like Donald Trump had. Biden said he expects to run for president again in 2024, and a reporter followed up asking, \\\"So is that a yes that you're running for reelection?\\\" \\\"Look, I don't know where you guys come from, man,\\\" Biden said. \\\"I'm a great respecter of fate. I've never been able to plan four and a half, three and a half years ahead for certain.\\\" Absent from the press conference was any further discussion of the pandemic, even as around 1,000 people a day continue to die of COVID-19, with an average of around 55,000 new cases reported per day over the last week. While vaccinations climb at a steady pace, with more than 14% of the people in the US now fully vaccinated, health officials are warning that the steep decline in cases seen since January appears to be leveling off. And in several states across the Northeast and the Midwest, new cases seem to be rising once again. In Michigan, where the rise in new cases is most severe, an alarming surge in hospitalizations and ICU admissions, particularly among younger people who are not yet vaccinated, has spurred criticism of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who loosened restrictions in the state in recent months. More contagious coronavirus variants continue to spread nationwide. \\u201CI continue to be worried about the latest data and the apparent stall we are seeing in the trajectory of the pandemic,\\u201D CDC director Rochelle Walensky said at a White House COVID-19 briefing on Wednesday. \\u201CThe decisions we make now will determine what the pandemic looks like in the days and weeks ahead.\\u201D \\u201CWe\\u2019ve made such extraordinary progress in the last several weeks, and if we choose to invest in prevention right now, we will ultimately come out of this pandemic faster and with fewer lives lost,\\u201D she added. Governors in states across the country have lifted mask mandates and moved to reopen completely. US health officials have pointed to an alarming rise in cases across Europe to warn against such rapid rollbacks as vaccine rollout continues. \\u201CWhen you see that leveling off at a high level, there is always a risk of a surge back up \\u2014 and in fact, unfortunately, that is exactly what is happening in Europe right now,\\u201D National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony Fauci said on Fox News Sunday. \\u201CThey thought they were home free and they weren\\u2019t and now they are seeing an increase.\\u201D"},{"author":"Hamed Aleaziz","title":"Biden Says He\u2019s Negotiating With Mexico To Take Back More Families","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/hamedaleaziz\/biden-negotiating-mexico-immigrant-families","content":"President Joe Biden said he is negotiating with Mexico to \\u201Ctake back\\u201D more immigrant families crossing the southern border as Trump-era restrictions are being rolled back. During his first press conference since taking office, Biden was put on the defensive regarding his handling of the southern border and vowed to speed up the release of unaccompanied children from cramped Border Patrol stations. One of the Trump-era policies Biden has kept in place is the practice of turning back many immigrants at the southern border under a public health order meant to curb the spread of the coronavirus, known as Title 42. Unaccompanied children have been the exception, but in recent weeks, the number of families crossing the border and being allowed to stay in the US has increased after Mexican officials passed a law prohibiting undocumented immigrant children from being held in detention centers. With no space to hold the families in US facilities, and Mexico refusing to take them back, they\\u2019ve started to be released in Texas border cities like McAllen and Brownsville. Biden on Thursday said he was negotiating with the president of Mexico to address the refusals to take back families at the border: \\u201CI think we are going to see that can change.\\u201D He added that the families \\\"should all be going back\\u201D and that only unaccompanied children would be the exception. The ACLU has been in negotiations with the US government for several weeks over blocking the use of Title 42 against families, and recently agreed to a delay in any judgment by the federal court to allow for a continued discussion. Biden\\u2019s comments, however, appeared to raise the possibility that those negotiations could be jeopardized. \\u201CWe put our Title 42 case for families on temporary hold in exchange for good faith promise to negotiate. But POTUS JUST said his hope is that U.S. wants to expel ALL families if Mexico will allow them,\\u201D Lee Gelernt, the leading ACLU attorney on the case, tweeted. \\u201CThen litigation may be only choice.\\u201D Biden on Thursday acknowledged the problem of overcrowding in Border Patrol stations but said his administration would soon transfer 1,000 children out of those facilities and into the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services. In recent days, HHS officials have scrambled to add additional capacity to help relieve the overcrowding. Still, Biden insisted that decisions to send children to the border were more rooted in the situation facing their families in their home countries than the policy choices of a president. As of Wednesday, the number of unaccompanied children in CBP custody had jumped again to 5,156, which appears to be the highest number in the last several weeks. Border agents had encountered more than 700 children on Wednesday alone. HHS officials have expanded capacity and are now holding nearly 12,000 children."},{"author":"Arianna Rebolini","title":"I'm Still Thinking About This Book About The Worst Earthquake In US History A Year After Reading It","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/ariannarebolini\/alaskan-earthquake-book-helped-me-through-pandemic","content":"\\u201CThere are moments when the world we take for granted instantaneously changes,\\u201D Jon Mooallem writes in the opening pages of his 2020 book, This Is Chance!, \\u201Cwhen reality is abruptly upended and the unimaginable overwhelms real life. We don\\u2019t walk around thinking about that instability, but we know it\\u2019s always there: at random and without warning, a kind of terrible magic can switch on and scramble our lives.\\u201D Mooallem is talking about the Great Alaskan earthquake \\u2014 a 9.2 magnitude quake that struck on March 27, 1964, decimated Anchorage, led to over 100 deaths, and remains the most powerful earthquake in US history \\u2014 but when I read the book for the first time last March, the scene felt uncomfortably familiar. At the time, I was beginning to suspect we were on the brink of our own catastrophe. My husband and I had, fortuitously, just moved to a new apartment so we no longer had to share a bedroom with our 6-month-old son, but after just three days of figuring out my new commute we were told we should probably work from home. Out on walks to explore our new neighborhood, neighbors were starting to wear masks; stores were starting to close. Soon those daily walks ended, too. But it was early enough that I believed in the brevity of this newly named pandemic\\u2019s effects. We\\u2019d all stay at home for a couple of weeks, maybe a month or two, until we got a handle on the spread. But then my husband\\u2019s salary was cut; soon after, mine was, too. We said goodbye to our nanny. We tried to find toilet paper. I sat on the floor of the shower and sobbed. You know how this story goes; you were there, too. We, like those at the epicenter of the 1964 quake, would soon find ourselves in a \\u201Cjumbled and ruthlessly unpredictable world they did not recognize.\\u201D I\\u2019ve returned to This Is Chance! a few times since last March. I interviewed Mooallem over text message, joking about the parallels between the book and our current bewildering reality, not yet realizing how far the destruction would reach. I wrote about the book for both our best of spring and end of year lists. For a while, I wouldn\\u2019t shut up about it to friends and acquaintances who, like me, were slowly losing the ability and will to read. And now, suddenly, it\\u2019s March of 2021. I\\u2019m putting together a list of new paperbacks, and there it is. I remember what it was like to read it for the first time, and I think, God, was I ever so young?This Is Chance! is about Genie Chance, a broadcast journalist and mom \\u2014 diligent but often underestimated, forced to placate the egos of her male colleagues and subjects (and husband) \\u2014 who experienced what\\u2019s now known as the Great Alaskan earthquake while driving with her son. She dropped him off at home and immediately ran back out to investigate. Using her transistor radio, Chance started broadcasting from her car, and then set up a station at the Public Safety Building, which became an impromptu command center. She began not even an hour after that first quake, and continued for the next thirty. Everything that happens in Anchorage over the course of the following three days passes through her; her story is the story of her city. Anchorage, which had been incorporated as a city just 44 years earlier, was unprepared; it \\u201Chad no protocol for this kind of emergency.\\u201D Chance saw the chaos around her \\u2014 felled buildings, crushed cars, split roads \\u2014 and decided to claim the responsibility of preventing a possible \\u201Cbreakdown of civil society,\\u201D to \\u201Cstave off that mayhem.\\u201D Others followed suit. A public works employee spearheaded a campaign to map out the city\\u2019s destruction and hazards, deputizing a group of city employees and volunteers using DIY armbands \\u2014 strips of white bedsheets with the word \\u201Cpolice\\u201D handwritten in lipstick. Amateur ham radio operators became ad hoc messengers, \\u201Chunkering in their radio-equipped cars to function as a kind of substitute telephone system.\\u201D An assistant professor took the lead on \\u201Corganizing a systematic effort to scour the city for those still missing and to collect the dead.\\u201D Not to mention the countless people digging through rubble on the street, pulling neighbors out of trapped cars, administering first aid. Recalling the response in the immediate aftermath, one resident said, \\u201Ceverybody tried to help [\\u2026] Clerks, bookkeepers. Everybody was trying to do a little bit of everything for everybody.\\u201D The city\\u2019s Civil Defense bureau was theoretically in charge of the emergency response, and the morning after the first 9.2 magnitude quake, Douglas Clure, who had recently resigned as the agency\\u2019s director, returned to the Public Safety Building to announce that it was taking control. But the office was a mess of \\u201Cantic ineffectualness.\\u201D Those who\\u2019d been doing the agency\\u2019s job for almost a full day \\u201Cfound it was faster, and less frustrating, to bypass Clure [and] just solve the problem themselves. They complained that Clure\\u2019s people moved too slowly, or in circles. Clure seemed hamstrung by finicky questions of protocol. \\u2018Who\\u2019s going to give me this authority?\\u2019 one Disaster Control worker remembered him asking continually, whenever some unconventional emergency action was proposed.\\u201D The earthquake revealed the fragility of the young city\\u2019s literal and figurative foundation. It also revealed its citizens\\u2019 strength. Facing a \\u201Ccomplete breakdown of all bureaucracy,\\u201D the community improvised its own disaster management system, comprising \\u201Cvolunteers \\u2026 ordinary citizens, many of whom seemed no more qualified to handle such a crisis than Genie was.\\u201D But handle it they did. Anchorage\\u2019s government failed the city largely because at the time it was \\u201Cstill an excruciatingly young place.\\u201D Ours had no excuse. We\\u2019ve spent over a year being failed \\u2014 by state and federal politicians voting against financial relief, botching lockdowns and vaccine distribution; by banks and landlords; by employers; and, yes, by some neighbors. But in the midst of the negligence of the systems ostensibly built to protect us, community formed around those looking to support and be supported by others. What else was there to do? People turned to mutual aid funds, crowdfunded support for small businesses, fought evictions, found and distributed PPE. If the pandemic has taught me anything, it\\u2019s that many of us survived not because of our governments, but in spite of them.We can\\u2019t talk about This Is Chance! without talking about Our Town. Thornton Wilder\\u2019s 1938 meta play about small-town life, about the extraordinary masquerading as the ordinary and vice versa, drives Mooallem\\u2019s narrative. When the earthquake hit Anchorage, its small local theater was preparing for a production of the experimental work; in the midst of the destruction, a fallen banner reading \\u201COur Town\\u201D lay in the rubble. It\\u2019s a detail that would read as too on-the-nose if this were fiction. Our Town\\u2019s plot is uneventful and almost beside the point \\u2014 in a small town called Grover\\u2019s Corners, two young neighbors fall in love, get married, grow old, and die. The star is the Stage Manager, a narrator with godlike omniscience who shoots into the future to describe each character\\u2019s whole life and eventual death, and zooms out to remind the audience how painfully insignificant a town and a life can seem when considered from a distance. Mooallem writes: \\\"The Stage Manager is saying: Remember us. Recognize us. It\\u2019s one community\\u2019s simple insistence that it mattered, made urgent by a suspicion that, ultimately, it might not matter. In other words, the overwhelming disaster everyone in Our Town is confronting is irrelevance: a creeping awareness that no matter how secure and central each of us feels within the stories of our own lives, we are, in reality, just specks of things, at the mercy of larger forces that can blot us out indifferently or by chance.\\\" In This Is Chance!, Mooallem fills the role of the Stage Manager; by tracking those three days in Anchorage, hour by hour, he takes up the mantle of demanding these people, this town, be recognized, despite the inevitability and mundanity of disaster. In a year of universal grief and loneliness \\u2014 when, so often and in so many ways, we were told our lives were expendable \\u2014 this rings especially true. What I realize now, revisiting the book, is that it didn\\u2019t stick with me because of its prescient portrayal of disaster \\u2014 it was its unsentimental testimony of cooperation, its rejection of nihilism in the face of catastrophe upon catastrophe. When describing the Chance family\\u2019s refusal to separate after the earthquake, despite Genie\\u2019s parents\\u2019 insistence that she send the kids to their home in Texas, Mooallem writes, \\u201COur force for counteracting chaos is connection.\\u201D It\\u2019s a sentiment that travels well. Nothing is unique in the grand scheme of things: how bleak, how beautiful. ●"},{"author":"Arianna Rebolini","title":"42 Great Books To Read This Spring, Recommended By Our Favorite Indie Booksellers","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/ariannarebolini\/spring-2021-books-independent-bookstores","content":"In a far future, a mostly human astronaut and her opinionated robot friend travel through the cosmos, battling isolation and the trials of cohabitation and sifting through pop culture fragments of the long-obliterated Earth.

Honey Girl tore me to pieces and then put me back together again \\u2014 I laughed, I cried, I said \\u201CThis is so sweet\\u201D out loud multiple times. \\u2014Katherine Nazzaro, Porter Square Books (Get your copy) A breathtakingly beautiful memoir about illness, healing, grief, and embracing the unexpected turns one\\u2019s life takes. Suleika Jaouad\\u2019s Between Two Kingdoms speaks frankly, without wallowing, about incredibly difficult experiences. Jaouad also owns up to her own shortcomings in a way that is so refreshing. This is truly a book that I will be thinking about for years to come. \\u2014Melissa Taylor, E. Shaver Booksellers (Get your copy)A mind-opening read for me. Why was it that famous women \\u2013 writers, artists, and actresses \\u2013 took refuge at NYC\\u2019s star-studded Barbizon Hotel during the 20th century? Whose idea was this 700-room, plushy, women-only hotel? Were Barbizon residents being protected from the ills of city life, or being held in a fashionable life to perpetuate the male-dominated corporate world? \\u2014 Faith, Wesleyan RJ Julia Bookstore (Get your copy) This thriller is written alternately from the points of view of popular social media influencer Emmy Jackson, her stressed out husband Dan, and the obsessive follower who is plotting to kill Emmy. It is dramatic and suspenseful, with a touch of humor to lighten the tension. I\\u2019ll never look at social media the same way again. \\u2014Laura B., RJ Julia Bookstore (Get your copy) As someone who\\u2019s worked at a feminist bookstore for over five years, I found Koa Beck\\u2019s book White Feminism informative and essential. Beck traces the long and violent history of white feminism from the suffragettes to the modern day. This book melds research, personal narrative, and insightful critique to demonstrate white feminism\\u2019s deep ties to capitalism, racism, ableism, homophobia, and more. Beck is a skilled journalist who articulates the inclusive feminist future that we all deserve \\u2014 one in which we work toward collective liberation rather than individual gain. \\u2014H. Melt, Women & Children First (Get your copy) Sasha Masha is one of the most important YA books to read and should be a standard in trans lit \\u2014 a novel that is both a coming-of-age story and a narrative of self-discovery and identity. Agnes Borinsky (herself trans) writes a lovely, empathetic queer romance that is universal to all. \\u2014Jesse, BookHampton (Get your copy) For the life of me, I don\\u2019t know why this book isn\\u2019t a classic. Originally published in 1962, Cassandra at the Wedding has everything: a deranged family reunion, twin sisters dealing with the trauma of having been child prodigies, a batty grandmother with the best one-liners, and one of the absolute greatest unlikable female narrators I\\u2019ve ever come across. Cassandra is a messy, ferociously intelligent queer woman in midcentury California. She travels home to celebrate her sister\\u2019s wedding; chaos ensues. Please buy this book and give Dorothy Baker the spot in the literary hall of fame that she so clearly deserves. \\u2014Lindsay Lynch, Parnassus Books (Get your copy) I loved this book so much I couldn\\u2019t put it down, but I also never wanted it to end. Charlie Jane Anders has created a gorgeous young-adult sci-fi universe. This book was filled with creative world-building, great sayings, and an incredible cast of characters. The explanation and reasoning behind each one, especially with respect to humanoid versus non-humanoid species, is just so well thought-out and intricate. The romance burns slow, and the villain is terrifyingly original. Whew. This book! I can\\u2019t wait for the next installment. This is, to date, my favorite book of 2021. I\\u2019m in love. Hot damn. \\u2014Paul Swydan, the Silver Unicorn Bookstore (Get your copy)Dignity is one of the best books I\\u2019ve read in a long time, and I dare say that it is a masterpiece. Ken Layne masterfully builds characters that exist for the most part off of the page, at the same time showing us a landscape that may be familiar but shines with a new beauty through his intense yet simple language. One could almost look at this novel as a manual for how to live in harmony with the natural world and fellow human beings. The adversity that Layne\\u2019s characters face while they have done nothing but try to take care of themselves and neighbors is strikingly accurate, and exposes how fragile the systems that claim to uphold our society truly are. This book is a quiet and peaceful protest against everything we know to be wrong but have come to accept and take for granted. Overall, it\\u2019s a beautiful story with lovable characters, and a blueprint for what is possible as we face environmental and societal break down. \\u2014Jean-Paul L. Garnier, Space Cowboy Books (Get your copy) The turbulent outside world laps at weathered, ancient shores in Jacobsen\\u2019s stunning follow-up to The Unseen (one of the great unsung masterpieces of last year). With her family scattered, Ingrid lives alone on the island of Barrøy, where her kin have farmed and fished for generations. But as World War II rages on, both pain and promise find their way to her. In this elegant, sparse novel, every moment is laden with significance as its denizens teeter between brutal memory and resilient hope. This is a book to be savored. \\u2014Sam Kaas, Third Place Books (Get your copy) I was blown away by Lucy Ives\\u2019 last book, Loudermilk, a Charles Portis\\u2013like dive into the absurdity of higher education, and I wasn\\u2019t let down by her follow-up book, the story collection Cosmogony. Ives\\u2019 worldview is a little weird, a little askew, and it\\u2019s hard for me to argue with this viewpoint these days. This is a playfully odd collection and a breath of fresh air for short stories in general. \\u2014Justin Souther, Malaprop\\u2019s Bookstore\\\/Cafe (Get your copy) Anjali Enjeti is known around Georgia as a powerful journalist and dedicated organizer for racial justice, voting rights, and Democratic candidates like Stacey Abrams, so it\\u2019s no surprise that her essay collection turns to the questions of what the dream of a just world \\u2014 a just US, a just Georgia \\u2014 might feel like. This collection is a balm for anyone who knows a better world is possible but struggles to know the next right step. The answer, time and again in this collection, is community, and beginning, quite simply, by showing up. \\u2014Errol Anderson, Charis Books & More (Get your copy) Infinity Son is a high-stakes, fast-paced adventure about a magical war between those born with magical powers and those who steal them. Brotherhood, love, and loyalty will be put to the test, and no one will escape the fight unscathed. Fans of Cassandra Clare will love this one. The sequel just came out, so this is the perfect time to pick it up! \\u2014April Poole, Porter Square Books (Get your copy) Crying in H Mart may be the most brilliant display of Michelle Zauner\\u2019s abilities. The Japanese Breakfast singer-songwriter\\u2019s elegiac memoir of grief and acceptance in the wake of her mother\\u2019s passing hits many a sore spot, sure. But there are also many joyful parts focused on the great catalyst of food \\u2014 and its ability to bridge psychic and emotional chasms wrought in mourning. It acknowledges how very complicated it is to grieve and celebrates life\\u2019s surprises. I love this book for how fearless and vulnerable it is. Thank you, Michelle. \\u2014Uriel Perez, BookPeople (Get your copy)Starting at the midlife crisis of an early-aughts indie rock never-was, Franz Nicolay delivers a tight-fisted gut punch of a novel, weaving a road-weary world with a lyricist\\u2019s skill for evocation, emotion, and economy. A requiem for the non-glamour of every minor scene that once, briefly, felt enormous, and an unflinching and finely rendered vision of old anthems clashing with new ideals, Someone Should Pay for Your Pain is a story of an \\u201CXennial\\u201D reckoning unto redemption, which fans of Nicolay\\u2019s band, the Hold Steady, will appreciate, and which will leave anyone who reads it brimming with ragged hope. A knockout fiction debut from a longtime troubadour. \\u2014Alex Houston, the Seminary Co-op (Get your copy) How to Resist Amazon and Why offers a succinct argument for shopping local while providing a detailed history of how the retail giant has failed its workers, consumers, and local communities. Buy it for your friends. \\u2014Gary Lovely, the Book Loft (Get your copy) For teenagers, it can feel like everything is happening at once \\u2014 while at the same time, nothing at all is happening. Forsyth Harmon eloquently captures the mixed ennui and loneliness of suburban living in the late \\u201990s, as well as the adrenaline rush that comes with being chosen by someone decidedly cooler than you. In this slim volume, we are privy to Ali\\u2019s brief yet profound relationship with the enigmatic Justine, who pulls her into a new world of drugs, partying, and eating disorders. Accompanied by simple line illustrations, Justine takes the reader through the heightened emotions of adolescence and the messy intensity of female friendships during a decidedly fragile time of life. \\u2014Isa, Politics & Prose (Get your copy) I absolutely loved this book! The concept is fascinating, and the prose is gorgeous. I had so much fun going on this adventure through the realms. I love the main character, Claire, and the idea of books coming alive and a library in Hell that holds unwritten works. As this was the first in the series, I can\\u2019t wait to spend more time with these characters and learn more about this fascinating universe Hackwith has built. \\u2014Candice Huber, Tubby & Coo\\u2019s Mid-City Book Shop (Get your copy) If Joshilyn Jackson has not yet been deemed the Queen of the Twist, I would like to award her that title. I picked up Mother May I before bed, wholly unprepared for how immediately drawn in I would be. I stayed up way too late and then did not put it down the entire next day. Rarely do I say something is \\u201Cunputdownable,\\u201D but I have no reservations about saying so in this case. Such a fantastic psychological mystery \\u2014 I was enthralled until the very end! \\u2014Shane Mullen, Left Bank Books (Get your copy) Women in translation are among the least published voices in the industry, but novels like Permafrost make it easy to add more to our reading lists. Permafrost is a quick, haunting, and sexy read about a lesbian with poignant and funny life observations. She strives to defy family expectations and Barcelona society, and leaves for Scotland. While there, she works as an au pair, living my life dream of ignoring responsibilities and reading all day instead. But Scotland\\u2019s rolling hills and greenery get old, and she embarks on new, exciting relationships in a new city: Brussels. If you miss traveling as much as I do, let this novel take you across the pond and country-hop without the cheap RyanAir flights or COVID risks. If you want a bold, witty novel about defying family expectations and society, this is for you. \\u2014Heather Halak, Third House Books (Get your copy)Fat Chance, Charlie Vega is one of my most recent favorites about a hilarious and charming fat brown girl trying to survive high school. I\\u2019ve never read a YA book that talks about fatness and body image in such a real, perfect way. It\\u2019s a book that I wish I had when I was 16, but it\\u2019s equally as validating reading it at 26. \\u2014Angie Sanchez, Old Town Books (Get your copy) The essays in this tender book balance artistic, academic engagement with personal narrative. The subtitle, \\u201CAdventures in Art and Intimacy,\\u201D is exactly right: Larissa Pham has created a remarkably self-conscious, nearly uncanny self-portrait of her gendered, raced body. She writes of visual art and artists with the same tenderness as the romantic and sexual intimacies of her own life. This book offers a warm and expansive portrait of a woman\\u2019s mind that feels at once singular and universal. \\u2014Annie Diamond, the Seminary Co-op (Get your copy) Caleb Azumah Nelson\\u2019s Open Water is a once-in-a-blue-moon kind of read, a truly remarkable debut from a gifted young wordsmith. The novel is at once a celebration of Black love and Black art and expression; its words vibrate and resonate at a steady, rhythmic cadence throughout the text. The love and care with which each sentence seems to have been crafted shines through the page. The usage of second person narration serves only to further the intimacy already articulated through the story, an intimacy that extends between the characters as well as between the reader and the work. Throughout, Nelson pays tribute to Black artists across mediums who have similarly spoken or written about the lived experience of Blackness, who have laid their souls bare for the avid reader or listener. Open Water echoes and honors this, effortlessly blending moments of love with those of loss, pain and grief with joy, vulnerability with strength. By the end, its protagonist has learned to embrace vulnerability, particularly with those he loves, and sees it as one with his sense of self as a Black man. A thoroughly unforgettable, searing read. \\u2014Meghana Kandlur, the Seminary Co-op (Get your copy) Happily Ever Afters introduces us to Tessa Johnson, a talented young writer who is afflicted with a crippling case of writer\\u2019s block just as she\\u2019s been accepted to the extremely exclusive creative writing program that could be the key to her future. The more she tries to find the words, the more she loses herself in the process. This YA debut from Elise Bryant is a charming look at the twists and turns of adolescence, of family and first love, with characters that leap off the page and \\u2014 much like a first love \\u2014 lodge themselves into your heart and never let go. A tender tale of growing up and finding your voice that tackles complex issues such as race, romance, and familial responsibility with dexterity and compassion, you won\\u2019t want this story to end. The perfect book to pick up this spring! \\u2014Mwahaki King, Papercuts J.P. (Get your copy) torrin a. greathouse is \\u201Ca transgender cripple-punk\\u201D and my new favorite poet! Sometimes, if I\\u2019m lucky, every year or so, there is a poetry collection that completely floors me, unnerves me, and opens my eyes by sheer force of words. May I introduce you to Wound From the Mouth of a Wound? There is so much power in these pages. If you\\u2019ve ever had complicated feelings toward the body (pretty sure that\\u2019s all of us), you\\u2019ve got to pick this one up. After reading the poem \\u201CThat\\u2019s so lame,\\u201D you\\u2019ll think twice about using the phrase: \\u201CI want to ask Did you know how this slur \\\/ feathered its way into language? By way of lame\\\/duck, whose own wings sever it from the flock\\\/ & make it perfect prey.\\u201D Each page, each sentence, surprises and cuts deep and will keep you reading, unable to turn away. \\u2014Kate Layte, Papercuts J.P. (Get your copy) Nearing the end of her life, legendary actress Evelyn Hugo finds herself as a Hollywood icon with a personal life shrouded in mystery. Hugo has always used men to get what she wants: a successful career. Now, she taps Monique Grant, an unknown reporter, to write her tell-all and spill the secrets behind those seven illusive marriages. Pick up this book, and time-travel through decades of sizzling gossip and old-school glamour. Full of twists and turns, each page of this story is more exciting and heart-wrenching than the last. I can\\u2019t wait to read it again! \\u2014Sarah Gemmell, Oblong Books & Music (Get your copy)The gold rush, the fountain of youth, folklore, and magical realism combine in a refreshingly modern and original novel that gifts its readers with an incredibly relatable portrayal of American teen life in Georgia suburbs in the George W. Bush era, before plunging us into Silicon Valley 10 years later for a subtle but powerful exploration of what the American dream is to children of immigrants. Neil is a second-generation desi teenager in an Atlanta suburb, having grown up constantly surrounded by other desi kids and parents with exceptionally high expectations for their American sons and daughters. Neil isn\\u2019t as driven as his older sister or his friends and classmates, but that all changes when he stumbles upon the major secret his neighbor and crush Anita and her mother have been hiding from the world. Gold Diggers is a feast of a story that swings from teen angst and laugh-out-loud humor to tragedy, from folklore to hard reality, and finally culminates in a heist that would make the Rat Pack proud. It breaks apart the mythology of monolithic culture with the perfect alchemy of humor, magic, and irresistible albeit flawed people. Let it sweep you off your feet. \\u2014Karen Valenzeula, Cellar Door Bookstore (Get your copy) Indelicacy has a quiet maturity, of a different time and place but none in particular \\u2014 no trace of the commonplace American contemporary sensibility found in many novels these days. To me, the main character epitomizes feminism, but there are other women in the book who reveal completely different life views and decisions that the main character respects as well. Cain hits the nail on the head when it comes to women who, with all their self-doubt and an even stronger inner will, refuse to be defined. Cain navigates some big questions: Can you ever really transcend the class you are born into? Who owns you? What makes someone weird? The protagonist loathes society\\u2019s small-mindedness but forges ahead. I loved this book. \\u2014Gena Brady, Subterranean Books (Get your copy) In The Rope, a chilling true crime story dovetails with the saga of efforts by Ida B. Wells and her allies to end the barbaric practice of lynching in America. When 11-year-old Marie Smith is sexually assaulted and murdered in the woods on the outskirts of Asbury Park, New Jersey, local authorities rely on only the thinnest of hearsay to pin the crime on a Black man, Tom Williams \\u2014 while the real killer, German immigrant Frank Heidemann, carries on with his daily life. While investigating this little-known crime, Tresniowski uncovers the near-successful efforts of vigilantes to lynch Williams as similar mobs had other innocent Black Americans in the decades after the failure of Reconstruction. Were it not for the dogged efforts of an investigator determined to pursue Heidemann and the efforts of Wells and others who would go on to found the NAACP, Williams and many others like him would have continued to suffer from such miscarriages of justice. \\u2014Kelly L. Barth, Raven Book Store (Get your copy) In Just As I Am, Cicely Tyson tells the story of her personal life and 60-plus-year career in show business as a Black women in America. It\\u2019s packed with details from the abuse her father inflicted on her mother to birthing a child at 18 and getting divorced. She shares the behind-the-scene particulars of her legendary, poorly compensated roles in the movies and her tumultuous on-again, off-again relationship with Miles Davis. What shines most is her frankly written style of her life as a model and actress against a backdrop of white supremacy, anti-Blackness, and sexism that many are just now recognizing still exists today. \\u2014Janeice R.

Detail after detail emerged about wealthy parents who paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy their kids\\u2019 way into upper-tier colleges, as the FBI pursued indictments for mail and wire fraud; more than 50 people were charged. Most of the public\\u2019s initial fascination was predictably fueled by the biggest celebrity names. Actors Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, who once played wholesome moms on Desperate Housewives and Full House, respectively, became stand-ins for the entire brouhaha, as memeable icons of hypocrisy and privilege. That Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, schemed on behalf of their daughter Olivia Jade, who\\u2019d already leveraged her celebrity proximity into a successful career as a beauty influencer, only made them bigger targets of derision. And the ridiculous staged rowing photos of her \\u2014 faking sports backgrounds was part of the scam \\u2014 helped ignite the social media roasting. But those celebs weren\\u2019t really central to the scandal\\u2019s meaning or the actual scheme, both of which are examined and reframed in the documentary Operation Varsity Blues: The College Admissions Scandal, now streaming on Netflix. This savvy contextualization of the investigation is framed as a kind of thriller, chronicling the rise and fall of Rick Singer, the onetime high school basketball coach turned college admissions adviser turned outright fraudster who orchestrated the entire operation. The documentary draws on FBI recordings of conversations between Singer and his clients, dramatized in cheesy but effective reenactments featuring unknown actors as the parents and a surprisingly compelling Matthew Modine as Singer (in a bad wig that is oddly fitting for this tale about fakery). But the reenactments are interspersed with interviews with former Singer colleagues, investigators, and lawyers, all of which add up to a critique of the college prep industry, higher education in the US, and an entire class of entitled parents. Eschewing the obvious celebrity or maternal melodrama angle, Operation Varsity Blues skeptically treats most of the college admissions industry as a kind of scam unto itself.Singer, who left high school coaching in Sacramento to become a college admissions adviser, is the documentary\\u2019s central figure. He first made a name for himself in the industry by, as one former colleague puts it, always being \\u201Cfishy.\\u201D He presented himself as a friendly admissions \\u201Ccoach,\\u201D helping families navigate the admissions process, and in his dressed-down, slouchy athletic attire he projected a kind of anti-charismatic relatability. But he\\u2019d make promises he couldn\\u2019t keep to parents, changed people\\u2019s ethnicities or races in applications, and lied to one couple about being responsible for getting their daughter into Stanford. Eventually, he got into more overtly criminal territory by identifying a way to maneuver around one of the most shamelessly egregious ways in which the US class system and education collide: the \\u201Ctradition\\u201D whereby billionaires who can afford to give Ivy League schools multimillion-dollar donations get a leg up on their kids\\u2019 admissions. (Jared Kushner is mentioned as one such mediocre student.) Singer saw those donations as an overly expensive \\u201Cback door\\u201D into elite schools. So he created a cheaper \\u201Cside door\\u201D entry into top schools, requiring hundreds of thousands of dollars rather than tens of millions. He realized that niche sports \\u2014 like fencing, water polo, rowing, sailing, and horseback riding \\u2014 could be an easier way to get students into these schools, because their departments were underfunded and needed donations. Further, admissions committees completely trusted recruiting coaches\\u2019 estimation of student athletes\\u2019 abilities. So Singer bribed coaches and athletic directors \\u2014 a Yale soccer coach, a USC athletic director, a Stanford sailing coach \\u2014 who would then accept students with nonathletic backgrounds as supposedly promising athletes. As part of his services, he also worked with standardized test proctors, who took the tests for his clients\\u2019 kids in order to raise their scores. Soon, he had a base of millionaire clients, like the Hot Pockets heir and lawyers, venture capitalists, and wine entrepreneurs, for whom he could guarantee admission. The documentary makes clear that the admissions scandal wasn\\u2019t just about one scammer or millionaire parents, but that the entire system is rigged in favor of those who already benefit from being upper class. As one college admissions critic points out, the sports Singer targeted are activities that most students in the US wouldn\\u2019t even have access to. Even without Singer\\u2019s scam, the entire standardized testing industry feeds into existing inequalities; the best predictor for good test outcomes is household income. And the obsession with college rankings has led schools to redesign their admissions criteria in search of ineffable prestige. Singer knew how to play on the parents\\u2019 weaknesses in search of that prestige \\u2014 for instance, he guilt-tripped Huffman, suggesting she\\u2019d spent too much time on her career to get her daughter into a good college, and told other parents that their kids would never get into their desired schools with the scores they had, even if it wasn\\u2019t true. The documentary peeks into the parents\\u2019 mindsets, exposing their class entitlement and clear-eyed ruthlessness. Michelle Janavs, the Hot Pockets heir, is caught on tape debating with Singer how to hide from her industrious younger daughter that they\\u2019re going to cheat to get her standardized test scores up. \\u201CMy younger daughter is not like my older daughter,\\u201D she explains. \\u201CShe\\u2019s not stupid. So if I said, \\u2018Oh, we\\u2019re going to take it up at Rick\\u2019s,\\u2019 she's gonna wonder why.\\u201D \\u201CIt\\u2019s weird family dynamics,\\u201D Janavs says, \\u201Cbut every kid is different.\\u201D A recurring theme in the recorded conversations with the parents is that they all wanted to get their sons and daughters into schools out of their range, despite the possibilities already open to them thanks to their built-in class privilege, while maintaining their kids\\u2019 innocence and belief in meritocracy. Though they\\u2019re not a big part of the narrative, Loughlin and Giannulli seem to be an exception in that they hid nothing from their daughters. When a USC guidance counselor starts asking questions about their daughters not being on the crew team, Loughlin calls him a \\u201Cweasel\\u201D in messages to her daughter; Gianulli writes, \\u201CFuck him,\\u201D \\u201Cnosey bastard.\\u201DThe FBI surveillance of Singer moves the unfolding drama along, forming mini portraits of the parents through their conversations with him. Smartly, it doesn\\u2019t try to humanize Singer or speculate much about his motives. (A former friend that he tried to date puts it best when she explains, \\u201CI really don\\u2019t know what made him happy or what his desires really were. \\u201CIt\\u2019s almost like a rat on a wheel, trying to get to a means to an end, and there was really no end in sight.\\u201D) Still, he remains a compelling cipher throughout, mediated through Modine\\u2019s reenactments. At one point toward the end of the documentary, we see the man himself in a footage reel for a reality show he tried to pitch about the families he worked with. Yet despite some egregious cases \\u2014 including a high school cheerleader he turned into a lacrosse player, or the fake rower Olivia Jade \\u2014 no one ever caught on and Singer\\u2019s scheme was not exposed. The entire scheme finally fell apart, in a kind of poetic justice, because one of his clients got prosecuted for securities fraud and offered the FBI information on one of Singer\\u2019s allies, a Yale soccer coach. He, in turn, informed on Singer. Singer then agreed to entrap the parents through phone calls. Almost all of the parents involved were sentenced to months in prison, though Singer himself still hasn\\u2019t been sentenced. The series creates effective drama out of the schadenfreude, with real footage of the parents walking out of their court appearances and details about their sentences. But Operation Varsity Blues doesn\\u2019t frame the arrests as easy answers to the problems it raises. The documentary is attentive to hypocrisy, for instance, about the fact that Stanford didn\\u2019t return the $700,000 that a sailing coach was fired for accepting, that colleges still deny that donations help people get accepted, and that the bloated college prep industry only gets bigger. Operation Varsity Blues is a reminder that the college prep industrial complex \\u2014 like college itself in the US \\u2014 increasingly seems like a racket. In some dramatic final footage, we see a reporter chasing a shirtless but completely calm Singer, seemingly walking to his car from a workout. \\u201CIs the system broken?\\u201D the reporter asks. \\u201CAny comment on anything?\\u201D Singer doesn\\u2019t respond. But the answer is clear.●"},{"author":"Tanya Chen","title":"Asian Women Are Hypersexualized, So Don\u2019t Tell Me The Killings In Atlanta Aren\u2019t About Race","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/tanyachen\/asian-women-fetish-racist-atlanta-shootings","content":"Waking up to the news that six Asian women were among eight people killed in the Atlanta area on Tuesday was brutal. Cycling through the online outrage, condolences, and conjecture was sobering and exhausting. America is a stationary bike, repeating bad patterns, and going nowhere fast. By mid-morning, the news was already full of reports that the shooting suspect had a \\u201Csex addiction,\\u201D which was apparently enough for local law enforcement to begin discounting that the mass killings could be \\u201Cracially motivated.\\u201D During a press conference, Capt. Jay Baker of the Cherokee County Sheriff\\u2019s Office also said the shooter had had a \\u201Cbad day\\u201D while discussing the attack. (BuzzFeed News later reported Baker had posted on Facebook a photo of a racist shirt blaming China for the pandemic.) A gunman targeted three Asian businesses and killed mostly Asian women. Whether the killer will admit to a motive beyond trying to eliminate \\u201Ctemptation,\\u201D what is indisputable is that he cruelly harmed Asian women. The Asian American community is now forced to cradle that violence between us, on our own. No one feels safe; everyone is hurting. The killings are racist. Period. This latest mass shooting comes at a time of rising anti-Asian sentiment in the US. Over the past year as COVID-19 spread, hate crimes against the minority group have also climbed steadily. According to Stop AAPI Hate, from March 2020 to the end of February 2021, there have been at least 3,795 reported hate crimes targeting Asian Americans. Last month, Asian elders were the targets of a string of attacks. These alarming trends are suspected to be tied to COVID-19 bigotry, fueled by former president Donald Trump\\u2019s constant remarks calling the disease the \\u201Ckung flu\\u201D or \\u201CChinese virus\\u201D and blaming China for the pandemic. Additionally, the latest Stop AAPI Hate report found that women reported being the victim of a hate crime 2.3 times more often than men. Someone who knew the shooter told the New York Times that he regularly visited spas for sex. The source said the shooter denied going to these businesses because of the workers\\u2019 race, but did so because it felt \\u201Csafer than paying for sex elsewhere,\\u201D the report said. These denials of racial motivations from the shooter, his friend, and law enforcement are incredibly revealing. Asian women are so often two-dimensional fantasies, fantasies that have become so normalized that they\\u2019ve fueled sex-kitten anime tropes, specific dom\\\/sub porn genres, and an entire sex work industry. Often, with this sexualization comes a very particular kind of dehumanization. I have been privileged enough to exist as an Asian woman with some protection and have still felt relatively acute racial trauma. But Tuesday's attacks made me aware of how impactful the traumas have been and have made me question how protected I really am in this country. In the wake of the shooting, many Asian women across the internet have also been reflecting on the hypersexuality that gets projected onto us for simply existing. Fetishy stereotypes follow us everywhere \\u2014 docile, demure, obedient \\u2014 and include verbal harassment in racial epithets (\\u201Clove you long time\\u201D) from men who have literally followed us in and out of bars. Being an Asian woman means moving through spaces with the constant anxiety that someone is about to make you their sex object or punchline. Melissa Borja, an assistant professor in the Asian\\\/Pacific Islander American studies program at the University of Michigan who\\u2019s led research on anti-Asian racism related to COVID-19 over the past year, told BuzzFeed News that while this shooter\\u2019s purported sex addiction does not carry an \\u201Cinherent anti-Asian\\u201D sentiment, popular culture has facilitated a particular sexualization of Asian women. \\u201CAsian American women are objects of desire, and this idea is reproduced in so many different ways, in so many different movies and musicals. It\\u2019s deeply rooted,\\u201D she said. Borja recounted a time when her husband was approached by a white man \\u201Cwho asked for advice for finding an Asian woman for a mating relationship.\\u201D \\u201CIt hinged on a view of Asian women as being less than human in ways that are really troubling to me,\\u201D she said. Borja also said that while there is an obsession to understand the motive of the killer in national tragedies like these, she wants us to center our concerns on the harm it\\u2019s caused. \\u201CWe know Asian American women are particularly affected by the past year and the anti-Asian racism that we see associated with the pandemic. The impact is really important, and it\\u2019s been really striking to me last night and today how sad they are, how angry they are,\\u201D she said. \\u201CEarlier today I just got off the phone with my 71-year-old mother who didn\\u2019t want to go on her afternoon walk because she felt afraid. That impact matters perhaps more than the intent of the killer.\\u201D NYC-based writer Christine Liwag Dixon, whose recent tweet about the fetishization she\\u2019s experienced in her life went viral, told BuzzFeed News that she often struggles to put into words what those cumulative experiences were like. \\u201CWhen something like that happens, even as a writer, it\\u2019s impossible to articulate yourself because you\\u2019re so overwhelmed and feeling so much,\\u201D she said. \\u201CThis is nothing new. Asian women have been dealing with this for generations.\\u201DFor Liwag Dixon, the fetishization started in grade school. \\u201CKids would say, \\u2018me love you love me long time,\\u2019 or ask me if my vagina was slanted sideways.\\u201D In high school, when the movie Memoirs of a Geisha came out, she said teenage boys were coming up to her asking, \\u201CAre you a geisha?\\u201D Liwag Dixon\\u2019s mom is Filipino and her dad is a white American, so she saw things \\u201Cup close\\u201D as a child, and intergenerationally. \\u201CPeople would always ask if my mother is a mail-order bride,\\u201D she said. \\u201CThey see an Asian woman and they see a white man and they just assume that the Asian woman is a gold digger. The blame is almost always centered on the woman in the scenario, like, The woman is a gold digger. The woman is an opportunist. They\\u2019re not saying how these Western men are abusing their own power.\\u201D Justine Galo, 46, tweeted that people have also sneered at her and her husband, who\\u2019s white. \\u201CSome people see me with my husband & joke around about the whole \\u2018mail order bride\\u2019 thing or \\u2018did you get your GI.\\u2019\\u201D Galo told BuzzFeed News that after she heard about the attacks, years of feeling \\u201Cresentment and disrespect\\u201D came up for her. \\u201CI experienced [racism] throughout my life from an ex-boyfriend who used to date a very timid woman he met in Korea and was so angered that I wasn't as accommodating as she was,\\u201D she said. She shared that he had physically assaulted her, which made her feel \\u201Clike some second-class form of Asian.\\u201D Audrey Yap, a professor of feminist philosophy at the University of Victoria, was also compelled to respond to the thread. She told BuzzFeed News she's experienced gendered violence in her personal life. \\u201CPeople sometimes seem to think that treating Asian women as exotic sex objects is somehow a compliment for us, when it's actually something that contributes to violence against us,\\u201D she said. Yap recommends reading an academic paper published in 2016 by Robin Zheng about the toxicities of \\u201Cyellow fever,\\u201D a term used to describe the fetishization of Asian people. Yap recognizes she benefits from being an Asian woman of a higher socioeconomic class \\u2014 a privilege that the women victims of the attacks did not have. But she\\u2019s also reminded that being a model minority does not mean white America sees her whole humanity. \\u201CI know that as Asian women go, I'm super privileged \\u2014 I have a good job. I don't need to rely on precarious work,\\u201D said Yap. \\u201CBut attacks like this definitely remind me that some people just see women like me through this racialized, stereotyped lens, and we might never really be full people to them.\\u201D Liwag Dixon\\u2019s viral tweet has inspired droves of Twitter users to commiserate together, and connect the dots between the shooter targeting spas while blaming his \\u201Csex addiction\\u201D and racism against Asian women \\u2014 what Atlanta area police and other news media have so far failed to do. Making that connection is crucial to acknowledging the invisible pain that sits in so many of our chests that was triggered this week. Growing up, I learned to shrink myself because I internalized that as desirable. I later understood that I need to speak up and take up space because that\\u2019s how I\\u2019ll survive in this country. All of these conversations women are having about microaggressions have also reminded me that I\\u2019m not alone, and that small racist particles contribute to an invisible disease that killed six Asian women this week. Liwag Dixon said these conversations are not ones she \\u201Cwants\\u201D to have with fellow Asian American women, but they\\u2019re necessary right now. \\u201CSeeing how many Asian women have experienced the same thing, there was a sense of solidarity, but it\\u2019s not the kind of solidarity I want to see \\u2026 It\\u2019s not that kind of experience I want to be universal, and yet it is,\\u201D she said. \\u201CSo often it is trauma that binds us together.\\u201D In the aftermath of this tragedy, Borja hopes to recenter the narrative on Asian women as leaders exacting change to combat anti-Asian hate. \\u201CIt\\u2019s important we talk about Asian American women \\u2026 as not just victims but people who are at the forefront of this work calling for change,\\u201D she said. \\u201CIt was then Kamala Harris and House Rep. Grace Meng who introduced resolutions last year against anti-Asian hate. It is Asian American women\\u2019s groups who are calling for changes at the state level. Most of the people involved at Stop AAPI Hate are women. Women in general are leading the call for change at multiple levels. I think it\\u2019s really important to remember that Asian American women are not just victims, but those leading the charge for justice.\\u201D These collective efforts, in the midst of a year of rising hate, are a necessary force of momentum that can hopefully start moving these cycle patterns forward.

Millions of office workers have had to spend the past year working from home, and while that posed its own set of problems, especially for parents, it also revealed that most businesses don\\u2019t need an in-person workforce to thrive, and that a more flexible work schedule could benefit the vast majority of employees.

Out of some 6.8 million doses of the vaccine, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) clots were reported in six women under the age of 50 between 6 to 13 days after getting a shot. One of the women died and another is in critical condition, officials said in a press briefing on Tuesday morning. Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said the pause was expected to be \\\"a matter of days,\\\" while the blood clots are reviewed. The agency does expect to see reports of more cases. \\\"We are aware of an extremely rare disorder involving people with blood clots in combination with low platelets in a small number of individuals who have received our COVID-19 vaccine,\\\" said a statement from Johnson & Johnson. The company will delay the rollout of its vaccine in Europe while the cases are reviewed, and later updated its statement to add that it is pausing all clinical trials of its vaccines as well. Similar concerns about extremely rare blood clots after a dose have surrounded AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, which also immunizes via a harmless cold virus carrying the genes for the spike protein of the coronavirus. European countries put the shot on hold while the frequency of the clots was weighed, linked there to 18 deaths. The AstraZeneca vaccine is not authorized for US use. Part of the intent of the Johnson & Johnson pause is to inform the medical community about proper treatment of the rare CVST clots, found in combination with low counts of blood platelets, according to health officials. \\\"Treatment of this specific type of blood clot is different from the treatment that might typically be administered,\\\" said the FDA and CDC statement, where the typical blood thinner treatment for blood clots may be dangerous. The CDC will convene a meeting of its vaccine advisory expert panel on Wednesday to review the clotting cases, weigh their significance, and consider limiting the vaccine to certain age groups. Although the cases were seen in women of child-bearing age, the FDA has not seen any link to birth control pills in the cases, noted the FDA's Peter Marks. \\u201CThis announcement will not have a significant impact on our vaccination plan,\\u201D because Johnson & Johnson vaccines make up less than 5% of recorded shots in the US, said Jeff Zients, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator, in a statement. \\u201CWe are working now with our state and federal partners to get anyone scheduled for a J&J vaccine quickly rescheduled for a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine,\\u201D Zients added. Early symptoms after the shot included headache in five of six patients, and back pain in the sixth followed by a headache. One also had abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Four patients later had strokes, including the patient who died. \\\"I support the FDA and CDC decision this morning,\\\" said Kathryn Edwards, scientific director for the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program. It was important that health officials are fully transparent with the public about any vaccine side effects, she stressed, to reflect a commitment to safety. \\\"We are all deeply committed to delivering safe and effective vaccines to the public.\\\" States including New York and Ohio have already begun either halting the use of the Johnson & Johnson shot or advising local vaccine providers to do so. Marks noted that if people decided with their doctor that they would go ahead and still get the shot after weighing the clot risks against their chances of getting COVID-19, the FDA would take no issue with the decision. Since the US reports of blood clotting look so similar to the ones seen in Europe linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine, they will likely emerge as a rare event for all of the COVID-19 vaccines that rely on harmless viruses as an immunization platform, Baylor College of Medicine vaccine expert Peter Hotez told BuzzFeed News, by email. That might include Russia's Sputnik vaccine, released without much safety data. \\\"This will be a problem for African and Latin American countries,\\\" Hotez added, unless more options become available. This \\\"adenovirus\\\" class of vaccines is particularly useful in immunization efforts because they only require standard refrigeration and one shot, in J&J's case. Meanwhile, Moderna announced that data suggests no link between the blood clotting issue at hand and its own vaccine, which relies on a separate mRNA technology for immunization. \\\"A comprehensive assessment of the totality of the available safety data for mRNA-1273 after over 64.5 million doses administered globally does not suggest an association with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) or thrombotic events,\\\" the company said in a statement."},{"author":"Dan Vergano","title":"Vaccinated People Can Travel, Says The CDC","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/danvergano\/covid-travel-guidelines-cdc","content":"Vaccinated people can safely travel, according to new CDC guidelines released on Friday, but must continue to take COVID-19 safety precautions while doing so, like wearing a mask in public and socially distancing. Release of the long-expected guidelines comes as US COVID-19 vaccinations have increased nationwide and as the summer travel season approaches. About 56 million people in the US, or 16.9% of the total population, are now fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, and 100 million people have received at least one vaccine dose. \\u201CWe now have several newly released studies documenting the real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, so today we are releasing an update to our guidance for fully vaccinated people,\\u201D CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a White House COVID-19 briefing on Friday. \\u201CFully vaccinated people can resume travel at low risk to themselves.\\u201D She added, \\u201CFor example, fully vaccinated grandparents can fly to visit their healthy grandkids without getting a COVID-19 test or self-quarantining, provided they follow the other recommended prevention measures while traveling.\\u201D But, she said, as COVID-19 cases continue to rise nationwide, \\u201CI would advocate against general travel overall.\\u201D The health agency has so far issued sparse guidance on what activities vaccinated people can safely resume. Last month, it released safety recommendations allowing vaccinated people to meet indoors with one another without masks or with one other unvaccinated household if they are at low risk of serious illnesses. Here is what the new CDC travel guidelines say: In the last week, healthcare worker data released by the CDC has shown that the widely used two-dose vaccines appear to prevent 90% of COVID-19 infections, a very effective rate, which has added to public health experts\\u2019 confidence in the shots. In particular, the finding that the shots prevent asymptomatic cases, thought to play a large role in spreading the virus, has boosted confidence about easing restrictions for vaccinated people. People are considered fully protected by the vaccines two weeks after their second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, or two weeks after their single shot of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Masks are still required on planes, buses, and trains under the CDC guidelines, as well as in airports and other travel hubs. States across the US are reporting a troubling rise in cases, which Walensky has warned threatens a fourth surge. On Monday, the CDC director attributed the increase in cases to the large number of unvaccinated people in the US, states that have rushed to reopen, the spread of more transmissible variants, and increased travel. Other experts have said they are optimistic that as vaccinations continue to roll out, especially among older people and other vulnerable populations, a rise in cases will not lead to as many hospitalizations or deaths. \\u201CWe are in a life-and-death race against the virus. And the war against this virus is far from won,\\u201D Jeff Zients, the White House\\u2019s chief pandemic officer, said on Friday. \\u201CEven as we\\u2019re vaccinating record numbers of people, we have many more people to get vaccinated, and we are seeing cases rise.\\u201D He added, \\u201CWe are working to put this pandemic behind us as fast as we can, but we\\u2019re not there yet.

In a late-stage trial studying more than 2,200 adolescents in the US, not a single vaccinated person became infected with COVID-19, Pfizer said in a press release. The results suggest the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine may be even more effective in 12- to 15-year-olds than it is in adults. Pfizer has not yet released the trial data. The company plans to submit the results to the FDA in the coming weeks, said chief executive Albert Bourla, \\\"with the hope of starting to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year.\\u201D If it wins emergency authorization, Pfizer's vaccine will be the first in the United States to be given out to children younger than 16. Public health experts believe that vaccinating children will be crucial toward achieving \\\"herd immunity\\\" \\u2014 when so many people have immunity to COVID-19 that the virus is no longer able to spread effectively. President Joe Biden has called for immunizing high school\\u2013age students by the fall in the US and elementary school ones early in 2022, if trial results like the one announced by Pfizer show the vaccines are indeed safe and effective among them. Pfizer said the trial showed the vaccine to be safe in 12- to 15-year-olds, with side effects \\\"generally consistent with those observed in participants 16 to 25 years of age.\\\" Pfizer's vaccine was first authorized for emergency use for people 16 and older in December, and more than 75 million doses have been given to Americans since then.

The bottom line: We still don\\u2019t know where SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, came from \\u2014 and it\\u2019s possible we never will. The most likely explanation, according to experts convened by the World Health Organization and the Chinese government, is that the coronavirus transmitted from its natural animal host to people via an intermediate wild species that was farmed for food. They rated a competing theory that the virus escaped in an accident at a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan as \\u201Cextremely unlikely\\u201D \\u2014 but devoted less than two pages of the report to that possibility. Some scientists criticized the report, which provides new details about what Chinese authorities did to try to find the source of the virus, but leaves many important questions unanswered. Efforts to identify the natural or intermediate animal hosts for the virus have so far drawn a blank. \\u201CWe\\u2019ve only scratched the surface of this very complex set of studies that needs to be conducted,\\u201D Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO food scientist and coleader of the study, said at the launch of the report on Tuesday. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told member countries on Tuesday that the study didn\\u2019t adequately analyze the possibility of a lab leak, according to Bloomberg. \\u201CAs far as WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table,\\u201D Tedros said in a public statement. \\u201CThis report is a very important beginning, but it is not the end. We have not yet found the source of the virus, and we must continue to follow the science and leave no stone unturned as we do.\\u201D Following the release of the report on Tuesday, the US State Department issued a statement on behalf of the US and 13 other countries, writing, \\u201CWe voice our shared concerns that the international expert study on the source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was significantly delayed and lacked access to complete, original data and samples.\\u201D The report was jointly authored by 17 WHO-appointed experts and 17 Chinese scientists. The sites they visited, and the wording of the report, required sign-off from the Chinese government. And, crucially, the study was not the forensic investigation that some scientists have called for \\u2014 going through freezers, databases, records of field sampling, and lab notes to probe the controversial theory that the virus escaped in an accident at a lab in the city of Wuhan. This theory emerged in the early days of the pandemic. One prominent member of the WHO\\u2013China team, Peter Daszak of the EcoHealth Alliance in New York City, has been among its most vocal opponents. He had collaborated for many years with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, sampling coronaviruses from bats and assessing the threat that they could cause a pandemic. For more than a year, he has described explanations involving a lab release as \\u201Cconspiracy theories.\\u201D Daszak also found himself at the center of a political storm in April last year. With then-president Donald Trump and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, both claiming they had evidence, without providing any details, that the virus came from the Wuhan lab, Daszak\\u2019s grant from the National Institutes of Health to collaborate with the agency was abruptly terminated. The resulting political polarization turned the lab origin idea into a third rail that many scientists didn\\u2019t want to touch.Daszak\\u2019s close links to the Wuhan Institute of Virology have also led some to question whether this conflict of interest made him a good choice for the WHO team. But he rejected the idea that this undermined his credibility. \\u201CIf I was to say I\\u2019m not going to China and not be involved with this, then I\\u2019m not doing my job,\\u201D Daszak told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CThis report has more information and more depth because of having me involved in it.\\u201D Still, given all the obstacles to a full and transparent investigation, some scientists wonder whether we will ever have conclusive answers about the origins of COVID-19. \\u201CI don\\u2019t know if we\\u2019re ever going to know in more detail than we do now,\\u201D said Jesse Bloom, a specialist in viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. \\u201CI still believe that we will find out, but I don\\u2019t know when and I don\\u2019t know how. And I\\u2019m not terribly encouraged by today\\u2019s report,\\u201D Daniel Lucey, a specialist in infectious diseases at Georgetown University in Washington DC, told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CIt leaves the great unknown: whether it was natural or not natural.\\u201D Here are the four main theories for the origins of COVID-19 that the WHO\\u2013China team considered: This is the explanation favored most strongly by the WHO\\u2013China team, rated as \\u201Clikely to very likely\\u201D in the new report. As the Chinese authorities investigated the initial outbreak in Wuhan in December 2019, scrutiny fell on the city's Huanan Seafood Market, which was connected to an early cluster of cases. Although the 12-acre site is mainly a seafood market, live animals and frozen meat were also sold at stalls. After the market was closed at the beginning of January, investigators in full personal protective equipment swabbed every available surface, sampled the remaining carcasses, and even tested sewage from the site. They found widespread evidence of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces, consistent with contamination by infected people, animals, or animal products, but no evidence of the virus in the remaining animals or carcasses. Given the evidence that the virus was circulating elsewhere in Wuhan in December 2019, it could well be that the market was contaminated by infected people, rather than being the source of the outbreak.But if SARS-CoV-2 did infect people via an intermediate species, it would fit with the precedent of two related coronaviruses that have jumped to people, each setting off a global health scare. SARS, which emerged in South China\\u2019s Guangdong province in November 2002, spread to more than two dozen countries, killing 774 people by the end of July 2003. By October that year, very similar viruses had been found in palm civets in live-animal markets in Guangdong. These common catlike carnivores are farmed and sold for food and are now believed to be the intermediate host from which SARS jumped to people. MERS emerged in Saudi Arabia in September 2012. Cases have since turned up in 27 countries, and the virus has so far killed 882 people. Within a year of the disease\\u2019s discovery, scientists had used antibody testing to show that there was widespread infection of dromedary camels in Oman. The virus was later found in camels across the Middle East and Africa, establishing this common domestic animal as the likely intermediary host. The problem is that no similar smoking gun has yet been found for SARS-CoV-2, even after Chinese scientists ran antibody and genetic tests on tens of thousands of samples from domestic and wild animals. \\u201CMore than 80,000 wildlife, livestock and poultry samples were collected from 31 provinces in China and no positive result was identified for SARS-CoV-2 antibody or nucleic acid before and after the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China,\\u201D the report said. There was an initial flurry of interest in pangolins, or scaly anteaters, after Chinese scientists pointed to similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses found in a small number of sick pangolins. But with subsequent testing of pangolins, this lead has failed to pan out. The WHO\\u2013China team placed its main bet on the intermediate-host theory because of evidence that meat from animals thought to be susceptible to similar coronaviruses, including bamboo rats, was sold in the Huanan market. The Chinese authorities also provided evidence of supply chains to Wuhan from wild animal farms in several provinces, including Yunnan in southern China. As the outbreak raged in Wuhan, China cracked down on this trade in February 2020, closing wildlife farms in Yunnan. But these farms were not subjected to the same intense swabbing and sample analysis as the Huanan market \\u2014 meaning we don\\u2019t know what viruses were present there at the time. \\u201CWhat they didn\\u2019t do is a very focused traceback,\\u201D said Daszak. The animals once farmed in South China have long since been killed, and many former wild animal farms have been converted into factories. So the most obvious trail for any subsequent investigation of the intermediate host theory has gone cold. Still, Daszak and other members of the WHO\\u2013China team are optimistic that testing wild animals in the region and running antibody tests on former wildlife farmers will eventually turn up evidence of infection with a virus that closely matches SARS-CoV-2. \\u201CI think it\\u2019s absolutely achievable,\\u201D Daszak said. \\u201CThe people who worked in the farms are still there.\\u201DMost scientists believe that SARS-CoV-2 ultimately came from bats, thought to be the natural hosts of SARS-like coronaviruses. If so, it could have spread straight from bats to people. The new report said that more than 1,100 bats in Hubei province, around the city of Wuhan, had been sampled and tested, \\u201Cbut none were positive for viruses close to SARS-CoV-2.\\u201D The closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2 is a virus called RaTG13, isolated from a horseshoe bat in a mineshaft in Mojiang, Yunnan province, by Shi Zhengli of the Wuhan Institute of Virology in 2013. In a February 2020 paper in Nature, Shi revealed that the genome of RaTG13 was 96% similar to SARS-CoV-2. This and other bat coronavirus genetic sequence data from the region suggest strongly that the ultimate origin of SARS-CoV-2 is a bat from South China or a neighboring country in Southeast Asia. People in that region are known to get infected by bat viruses: In 2018 Daszak and Shi reported that 6 out of 218 people living near caves with bat roosts in Jinning District, also in Yunnan province, had antibodies to SARS-like bat coronaviruses. But the 4% difference between RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 represents at least a couple of decades of viral evolution, so the two viruses are still far removed from one another. And if SARS-CoV-2 did jump straight from bats to people, it\\u2019s hard to explain why the pandemic started in Wuhan, more than 1,000 miles away from the rural areas near China\\u2019s southern border, where you would expect the first clusters of human cases to show up.After the initial SARS outbreak, accidental infections of staff happened at labs studying the virus in Singapore, Taiwan, and China, including several at the Chinese National Institute of Virology in Beijing. It\\u2019s this history of accidents that makes some scientists question why the WHO\\u2013China study team rated the possibility of a lab origin for COVID-19 as \\u201Cextremely unlikely.\\u201D \\u201CIt\\u2019s reasonable to ask why they\\u2019re being so dismissive,\\u201D Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, told BuzzFeed News. Proponents of the idea that the virus escaped from a lab have pointed to unusual features of its genetics and biology.Over the course of the outbreak of SARS, scientists tracked the virus mutating rapidly as it adapted to its new human hosts. But SARS-CoV-2 burst onto the scene seemingly already perfectly adapted to transmit from one person to another. For SARS-CoV-2 to get into human cells, the spike protein on its surface must latch onto a receptor on the cells called ACE2. After the first complete genetic sequence of the virus was posted online by Chinese scientists in January 2020, a team led by Nikolai Petrovsky, an immunologist who works on vaccine development at Flinders University near Adelaide in Australia, started running computer simulations of how well the coronavirus spike protein could bind to ACE2 receptors from different species. \\u201CWhen we got to the end of the project, what stumped us was that binding to human ACE2 was higher than for any species we tested,\\u201D Petrovsky told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CFor us, that was very hard to explain based on a natural origins theory.\\u201D Other scientists focused on part of the spike protein called a \\u201Cfurin cleavage site,\\u201D which seems to be an important factor in the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect human lung cells \\u2014 speculating this had been deliberately inserted into the virus to study genetic changes that can make coronaviruses more dangerous to people. But in March 2020, scientists led by Kristian Andersen of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, concluded that the virus didn\\u2019t look as if it had been genetically engineered. If so, they argued, you\\u2019d expect to see a backbone of a familiar coronavirus used in such experiments with a few key changes. But SARS-CoV-2 has a wide array of mutations throughout its entire genome that separate it from known coronaviruses.Still, some scientists have continued to speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may have been engineered to study the changes that could make a naturally occurring coronavirus into a pandemic threat. Such \\u201Cgain-of-function\\u201D research has long been controversial because of the risks it could pose. Suspicion fell on Shi of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Daszak\\u2019s longtime research collaborator because of her previous gain-of-function work. In 2015, she and Ralph Baric, a virologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, had published controversial experiments in which they spliced the spike protein from a SARS-like bat coronavirus into another coronavirus that had been previously adapted to infect mice to study the potential for the type of cross-species transmission that could trigger a pandemic. The lab origin theory was already a political minefield after Trump and Pompeo got involved. And things became even more fraught in fall 2020 when a scientist who had fled to the US from Hong Kong, Yan Limeng, teamed up with a group linked to former Trump strategist Steve Bannon. Yan posted two papers making the incendiary claim that SARS-CoV-2 was an engineered bioweapon deliberately released by the People\\u2019s Liberation Army. Experts overwhelmingly agree that this is a wild conspiracy theory. And many virologists also remain unconvinced by the idea that SARS-CoV-2 was engineered in well-intentioned gain-of-function experiments. While the furin cleavage site is unusual, Susan Weiss, a coronavirus specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, told BuzzFeed News that experts still don\\u2019t understand exactly how specific furin cleavage sites can make viruses more dangerous. \\u201CI just don\\u2019t buy that any human could figure that out,\\u201D she said. But as the political temperature has dropped in the wake of Trump\\u2019s electoral defeat, some scientists have been discussing the lab accident theory more openly. \\u201C[I]f SARS-CoV-2 escaped from a lab to cause the pandemic, it will become critical to understand the chain of events and prevent this from happening again,\\u201D wrote David Relman, a microbiologist at Stanford University, in an opinion piece published in PNAS, the journal of the National Academy of Sciences, on Election Day. Shi did not respond to requests for an interview from BuzzFeed News. But the experiment with Baric was conducted in North Carolina, not Wuhan. And in emailed responses to questions from Science magazine in July 2020, Shi flatly denied having run any similar experiments since. A lab accident doesn\\u2019t need to involve genetic engineering, however. Shi\\u2019s group has collected thousands of samples from bats across China. Ruling out the idea that COVID-19 arose when a virus escaped from the lab would require the Wuhan institute to open up all the records of its viruses and the audit it performed to investigate whether any one of them was a close match to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese government did not allow that to happen. Adding to the impression of secrecy, an online database continuing information on the institute\\u2019s genetic sequences and samples seems to have gone dark in September 2019 and hasn\\u2019t returned to public view since. During their visit to the Wuhan institute, members of the WHO\\u2013China study team asked questions about the database and the audit of virus samples. They were told the database was removed after multiple hacking attempts. \\u201CTheir answers can then be looked at and pulled apart. And that\\u2019s what we did,\\u201D Daszak said. \\u201CThere really is no evidence of a lab leak. I\\u2019ve not seen it and I\\u2019m looking for it.\\u201DWhen leaders of the WHO\\u2013China team announced their initial conclusions in a press conference on Feb. 9, many scientists were astonished that they were taking this theory seriously. For months, the Chinese authorities had controversially linked renewed outbreaks of COVID-19 in the country to imported frozen seafood. It seemed to be a narrative calculated to promote the idea that the disease may have first emerged abroad. \\u201CWe know that the virus can persist and survive in conditions that are found in these cold and frozen environments, but we don\\u2019t really understand if the virus can then transmit to humans,\\u201D Embarek, the WHO food scientist who led the WHO\\u2013China team, said at the February press conference. \\u201CSo a lot of work needs to be done to better understand these interesting pathways.\\u201D Speaking in an online discussion organized by the UK-based international think tank Chatham House earlier this month, Marion Koopmans, a virologist at the Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, said the team was thinking more about frozen wildlife meat rather than frozen seafood \\u2014 which would link the idea to the intermediate host theory. \\u201CThat\\u2019s what we think is still a very, very valid option,\\u201D Koopmans said. Many virologists think it\\u2019s unlikely that frozen food was the origin for COVID-19, partly because studies of transmission of the virus from surfaces or objects \\u2014 known as \\u201Cfomites\\u201D \\u2014 suggest that it\\u2019s very inefficient compared to transmission through the air. \\u201CThe bottom line is that fomite transmission can happen, but it\\u2019s very rare,\\u201D Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, told BuzzFeed News. More than a year into the pandemic, and with the biggest effort to pin down its cause having delivered an open verdict, speculation of a lab origin is going to continue. But if anything, the continued demands for further investigation of that possibility are only likely to make the Chinese authorities block further release of information from the Wuhan lab. \\u201CI think that origin story for the virus is much less likely, and the loud demands of that theory\\u2019s proponents make it ever less likely that the Chinese government would ever consent to that type of investigation,\\u201D Rasmussen said. In one key respect, Tuesday\\u2019s report gives the Chinese authorities exactly what they want: The terms of reference of the study, released in November last year after extensive negotiations between the WHO and China, framed it as the \\u201CChina Part\\u201D of a global study. Having opened its doors to an international team of experts, China will now likely argue that other countries need to do the same. ●"},{"author":"Peter Aldhous","title":"Rising US COVID-19 Cases Spark Fears Of A Fourth Surge","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/peteraldhous\/cdc-cases-warning-fourth-surge","content":"If you thought the pandemic was over in the US, think again. After almost three months of steady decline, the number of daily new cases of COVID-19 across the nation is rising. In several states, led by Michigan, the number of people in hospitals is also climbing. That leaves the US at a critical juncture, experts warn. Even as the vaccine rollout picks up speed, the reopening of businesses, including bars and restaurants in many states, increased travel, a widespread sense of COVID fatigue, plus the spread of more transmissible and deadly variants, means that the US could be at the start of a fourth coronavirus surge. \\u201CI am going to pause here, I\\u2019m going to lose the script, and I\\u2019m going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom,\\u201D a visibly shaken Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, said at a White House COVID-19 briefing on Monday. \\u201CWe have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are, and so much reason for hope, but right now I\\u2019m scared.\\u201D Health officials on Monday urged Americans to continue getting vaccinated, wearing masks, social distancing, and following CDC travel guidelines to prevent a fourth surge. \\u201CWe really need to hold on to the public health measures as we get more and more people \\u2014 from 2- to 3-plus million people \\u2014 vaccinated every day,\\u201D said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \\u201CIt will be a race between the vaccine and what\\u2019s going on with the dynamics of the outbreak. We can win this by just hanging in there a bit longer.\\\"After a steep decline in new COVID-19 cases from the start of January, daily new cases across the nation began to level off and then ticked upward last week. Another key indicator of a renewed surge, the positive percentage of daily COVID-19 tests, has been rising for about three weeks. Surges in the number of people in the hospital and daily reported COVID-19 deaths typically lag behind rises in cases by a few weeks. \\u201CWhen we see that uptick in cases, what we\\u2019ve seen before is that things really have a tendency to surge, and surge big,\\u201D Walensky said. \\u201CWe know that cases can sometimes be a week or two behind the behavior that leads to those cases \\u2014 the mixing that leads to those cases \\u2014 we know that travel is up, and I just worry that we will see the surges that we saw over the summer and over the winter again.\\u201DThe rise in new cases began in Michigan, then fanned out across the Midwest and the Northeast. Now cases are rising in states from Hawaii to Florida \\u2014 where spring break partying alarmed local health officials and led to clashes with police. \\u201CAn enormous number of people are coming our way, and many of them, if not most, seem to have forgotten that there\\u2019s a pandemic,\\u201D the mayor of Miami Beach, Dan Gelber, told USA Today on March 15. \\u201CI\\u2019m really worried about the spring break activity in Florida,\\u201D George Rutherford, an epidemiologist at UCSF, told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CWe\\u2019ll know soon if those people brought cases back home with them. If we see an outbreak in Alabama in a college town all of a sudden, we might say, \\u2018Yeah, that was the problem.\\u2019\\u201D More dangerous coronavirus variants may be partly to blame for the rises in cases. Data from the CDC shows that Florida and Michigan lead the nation for confirmed cases of the more transmissible and deadly B.1.1.7 coronavirus variant, first seen in the UK. But this data provides a limited view of the spread of variants in the US, since genetic surveillance for these variants is still not widespread. \\u201CWe know about 26% of all sequenced virus is now the B.1.1.7 variant,\\u201D Walensky said. \\u201CAnd that may be one of the reasons, if people are not doing the things \\u2014 masking and distancing to protect themselves \\u2014 this variant is probably less forgiving and more infections will occur.\\u201D Health officials also pointed to loosening restrictions in many states as a key problem. \\u201CIf we open up completely now, that is premature, given the level of infection that Dr. Walensky described,\\u201D Fauci said. \\u201CWe are really doing things prematurely right now with regard to opening up.\\u201D Walensky said she would be meeting with governors on Tuesday to urge them to \\u201Crefrain from opening up too fast.\\u201DTrends in Michigan provide an alarming view of where the entire nation may be headed. Experts hope that the rise in cases won\\u2019t be followed by such steep rises in hospitalization and deaths as in previous surges, because those getting infected now are mostly younger people who have not yet been vaccinated. \\u201CThe case count will become less of a focus as hospital capacity is no longer able to be threatened,\\u201D Amesh Adalja, a specialist on pandemic preparedness at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told BuzzFeed News. But in Michigan, the number of people in the hospital is now rising almost as steeply as it did in the fall, and the daily reported death toll also seems to be rising. \\u201CWe just had a perfect storm in Michigan, it all happened together,\\u201D said Michigan State University epidemiologist Debra Furr-Holden. She attributed the rise in cases to the spread of B.1.1.7, reopening bars, gyms, and restaurants on Feb. 1, COVID-19 fatigue, warmer weather, and vaccination giving people false confidence to quickly resume risky behaviors. \\u201CWe cannot think that we can vaccinate our way fast enough out of the spread to prevent this from going up again.\\u201D The coronavirus is also surging again in Europe, providing another warning for the US. In France, Germany, and Italy, the daily counts of new cases have risen sharply in the past few weeks \\u2014 although Italy has managed to slow its surge after introducing renewed strict controls, including closing stores, schools, and restaurants. One important advantage for the US, however, is that it has so far fully vaccinated 15.5% of its population, compared to 4.9% in Italy, 4.6% in Germany, and just 3.9% in France. That\\u2019s largely because of vaccine supply issues in Europe, leading to a dispute with the UK, which secured doses of AstraZeneca\\u2019s vaccine earlier than the European Union. But just relying on the vaccines to halt rising cases may not be enough, especially because younger people are not yet eligible for vaccination in many states unless they have health conditions or occupations that put them at greater risk. \\u201CWe are not powerless \\u2014 we can change this trajectory of the pandemic,\\u201D Walensky said at the White House press briefing. \\u201CBut it will take all of us recommitting to following the public health prevention strategies consistently while we work to get the American public vaccinated.\\u201D"},{"author":"Dan Vergano","title":"New AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness Data","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/danvergano\/astra-zeneca-vaccine-covid-coronavirus-effectiveness","content":"The drugmaker AstraZeneca slightly lowered estimates of its COVID-19 vaccine\\u2019s effectiveness in preventing the disease to 76%, after US health officials questioned numbers released earlier in the week. The new results \\u201Chave confirmed vaccine efficacy,\\u201D AstraZeneca wrote in a news release, adding that the numbers would be submitted to the FDA to get an emergency use authorization for the vaccine. \\u201CThe primary analysis is consistent with our previously released interim analysis,\\u201D said Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca\\u2019s executive vice president for biopharmaceuticals, in the new release. On Monday, the company had announced the vaccine was 79% effective in preventing cases of COVID-19 with symptoms. The results were based on a major clinical trial run in the US and South America with more than 32,000 volunteers. That initial estimate rested on a Feb. 17 cutoff in case counts, according to the company. But later that day, an independent panel of medical experts appointed by the federal government to monitor the trial notified US health officials that it was \\u201Cconcerned\\u201D about the way the results had been presented. Shortly after midnight, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases released a highly unusual statement warning that \\u201CAstraZeneca may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data.\\u201D \\u201CWe\\u2019re always concerned when there is an apparent miscommunication, if you want to use that word, that that it would add to an already existing level of vaccine hesitancy,\\u201D NIAID chief Anthony Fauci said at a White House briefing on Wednesday. But he said that despite the disagreement, the vaccine does seem to be safe and effective. \\u201CAt the end of the day, when you look at the data, this is going to turn out to be a good vaccine,\\u201D said Fauci. The new estimate found that the shots were 85% effective in people older than 65. The earlier release had put that number at 80%. And the vaccine seems protective against severe COVID-19 cases leading to hospitalization, with no cases seen among recipients. There were eight severe cases in the placebo group. While it may seem surprising to have gone through so much drama for such a small change in the numbers, John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, speculated that this week\\u2019s roller-coaster may reflect a clash of cultures between a European company and the US system of trial oversight and vaccine approval. \\u201CAstraZeneca is not an American company, and not a vaccine company,\\u201D Moore told BuzzFeed News, adding that US independent monitoring boards \\u201Care used to offering advice and expecting that advice to be attended to.\\u201D The new release provides more information, including on the uncertainty around the numbers: The overall estimate of 76% efficacy has confidence intervals running from 68% to 82%. \\u201CThere are certainly differences in the two press releases and the second one has more information, which is good,\\u201D Moore said. AstraZeneca\\u2019s vaccine, developed by a team at Oxford University in the UK, has had a troubled history. Initial results from clinical trials in the UK and Brazil, first announced in November, involved a confusing array of experimental groups with different doses, intervals between shots, and age groups, making it hard for experts to understand how well the vaccine worked. Even before those results came out, AstraZeneca had angered FDA officials by failing to promptly communicate the news that two patients in the UK trial had developed neurological symptoms. The US trial was halted for almost seven weeks until the FDA was satisfied with the information the company provided. This month, many European nations paused giving AstraZeneca shots, approved across the European Union on Jan. 29, following reports of two very rare blood clotting conditions. After investigating 25 cases that led to nine deaths among some 20 million people given the vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that the benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID-19 far outweighed the risk of the serious but very rare clots. The US is still awaiting FDA evaluation and authorization of the AstraZeneca vaccine. But if this follows the timeline of earlier approvals of vaccines from Pfizer\\\/BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson, authorization could come in May. \\u201CThe final determination of the analysis of the data will be done by the FDA,\\u201D Fauci said. \\u201CAt the end of the day, everything is going to be open and transparent, and hopefully that will dispel any hesitancy that was associated with this little bump in the road.\\u201D \\u201CThis is an argument over paperwork, and an argument against science by press release,\\u201D Moore said. \\u201CWhat matters now is not what\\u2019s in a press release. What really matters now is what they file with the FDA and what the FDA thinks of it.\\u201D"},{"author":"Peter Aldhous","title":"US Health Officials Question AstraZeneca\u2019s Vaccine Results","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/peteraldhous\/astrazeneca-vaccine-us-trial","content":"Results from AstraZeneca\\u2019s key US trial of its COVID-19 vaccine, issued by press release on Monday morning, exceeded experts\\u2019 expectations. But less than a day later, US health officials questioned the results, which still have not been released in full. In a trial involving more than 32,000 volunteers, about two-thirds of whom received the vaccine, the shots had a 79% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, the company said. This was based on 141 cases of the disease that occurred across the vaccine and placebo arms of the trial. There were no cases of severe disease requiring hospitalization among people given the vaccine, compared to five in the placebo arm, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) chief Anthony Fauci said during a White House press conference on Monday. \\u201CThe good news is also that there was comparable efficacy across ethnicity and age,\\u201D Fauci said. But early Tuesday morning, NIAID released a highly unusual statement casting some doubt on the company's report of its results. The company \\u201Cmay have included outdated information from that trial,\\u201D the statement said, \\u201Cwhich may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data.\\u201D The statement said that late on Monday, the Data Safety Monitoring Board, the independent panel of medical experts tasked with overseeing AstraZeneca's US trial, notified NIAID and other health officials that it was \\u201Cconcerned\\u201D about the way the results had been presented. On Tuesday morning, AstraZeneca responded to the concerns raised by the independent panel of experts. \\u201CThe numbers published yesterday were based on a pre-specified interim analysis with a data cut-off of 17 February,\\u201D the company wrote. \\u201CWe have reviewed the preliminary assessment of the primary analysis and the results were consistent with the interim analysis. We are now completing the validation of the statistical analysis.\\u201D The company promised to \\u201Cimmediately engage\\u201D with the independent panel to \\u201Cshare our primary analysis with the most up to date efficacy data,\\u201D saying it would issue results within the next two days. \\u201CAs an FDA advisory committee member I want to see all the data \\u2014 all the data that has been collected. Any experience with this. Anything that\\u2019s relevant to the decision,\\u201D said Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at the Children\\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, who sits on the FDA's vaccine advisory committee. \\u201CBecause the most important thing we consider with these vaccines is safety. Safety, safety, safety.\\u201D Appearing on Good Morning America on Tuesday, Fauci said that the DSMB wrote a \\u201Crather harsh note\\\" to AstraZeneca, copying Fauci, saying that they felt the data in the press release \\u201Cmight in fact be misleading a bit.\\u201D \\u201CIt really is unfortunate that this happened,\\u201D Fauci said. \\\"This is really what you call an unforced error, because the fact is this is very likely a very good vaccine.\\u201D Other experts expressed similar concerns about how the company had presented its data. \\u201CIt is a good vaccine, but this sort of public relations stuff makes it all a bit messier and more complicated. It\\u2019s more difficult for the public to parse out what\\u2019s going on. We just want a clean straightforward process that is easy to interpret,\\u201D Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CWe don\\u2019t really have any details. But just the appearance of it all isn\\u2019t doing anyone any favors.\\u201D The statement from NIAID caught many scientists off-guard. \\u201CWe\\u2019re in uncharted territory. DSMBs don\\u2019t normally do things like this, and the bar for a federal agency to issue a statement raising concerns about a high profile corporate trial is surely very, very high,\\u201D John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, told BuzzFeed News by email. The statement from US health officials is just the latest in a series of problems that the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine trials have faced. Earlier results from trials in the UK and Brazil \\u2014 run by the University of Oxford, which developed the vaccine \\u2014 had indicated around 70% efficacy overall. But scientists were critical of those trials, which had included an array of experimental subgroups with patients of different age ranges, doses, and intervals between the two shots of the vaccine, making it very hard to interpret the numbers. This also meant that the Oxford team had been unable to gather enough data to answer a key question: Does the vaccine protect older people who are most vulnerable to COVID-19 from getting sick? That caused some nations, initially including Germany, to delay authorizing the vaccine for use in older age groups. The new trial finally has enough data to answer this question, according to the company\\u2019s release. Analysis of the results among people ages 65 and older indicated 80% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19. \\u201CThese findings reconfirm previous results observed in AZD1222 trials across all adult populations but it\\u2019s exciting to see similar efficacy results in people over 65 for the first time,\\u201D Ann Halsey of the University of Rochester School of Medicine, who co-led the trial for AstraZeneca, said in the company\\u2019s release. Crucially, the new trial, run in the US and several other countries, is a much simpler design than those run by the Oxford team, with just two experimental groups. Volunteers were either given two doses of the vaccine four weeks apart or two saline injections as a placebo control. Moore, who has been a prominent critic of the Oxford-run trials, last week described the US trial to BuzzFeed News as a \\u201Crigid protocol\\u201D that should produce findings that are easier to assess. The company has not yet released any data beyond the results summarized in its press release but said a paper \\u201Cwill be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.\\u201D The results will also be submitted as the centerpiece of AstraZeneca\\u2019s application to the FDA to have the vaccine authorized for emergency use in the US. \\u201CWe are preparing to submit these findings to the US Food and Drug Administration and for the rollout of millions of doses across America should the vaccine be granted US Emergency Use Authorization,\\u201D Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca\\u2019s executive vice president for biopharmaceuticals, said in Monday\\u2019s release. These results suggest that AstraZeneca\\u2019s two-dose vaccine is a little more effective at preventing COVID-19 than the single-shot vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson, which was 66% effective in preventing disease in its major trial. Both seem less effective than the two-shot vaccines made by Pfizer\\\/BioNTech and Moderna, which exceeded 90% efficacy. All four vaccines seem to provide very strong protection against severe COVID-19. The new trial results come after a safety scare for the AstraZeneca vaccine last week, when many European nations temporarily withdrew the vaccine from use after reports of rare but serious blood clots. The European Medicines Agency then analyzed data for almost 20 million people who were given the vaccine, finding 18 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), which can prevent blood draining from the brain and cause hemorrhages, and seven cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which causes clots in tiny blood vessels throughout the body. While the agency was unable to rule out a link with the vaccine, it said that benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID-19 far outweighed the risk of these serious but very rare conditions, and recommended that vaccination resume. AstraZeneca said it found no cases of CVST in its trial. This was expected, since the condition is very rare and only around 21,000 people were given the vaccine in the trial. Even before Tuesday's statement from US health officials, some experts were concerned that the vaccine\\u2019s troubled history might make it less attractive to the US public than the alternatives that are already available. \\u201CThe FDA now has to make a decision, but even if this vaccine is approved it could be difficult to persuade the public to take it,\\u201D Moore told BuzzFeed News on Monday. \\u201CPerception can become reality in situations like this, and the public trust simply may not be there now.\\u201D Last week, the Biden administration announced that it would loan millions of pre-manufactured doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Canada and Mexico, where it has already been approved.

But the agency said it could not rule out a link with two rare blood-clotting conditions seen in 25 people who were given the vaccine. It added that warnings should be included with information about the vaccine provided to doctors and patients. Nine of these people have died. The EU\\u2019s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) was asked to review the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine after more than 20 European countries \\u2014 including Germany, France, Italy, and Spain \\u2014 halted vaccinations following reports of rare clotting disorders. After the EMA's announcement, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain all said they would resume using AstraZeneca's vaccine. On Thursday, EMA Executive Director Emer Cooke told a press briefing that the committee found a reduced overall incidence of blood clots, compared to the general population, in almost 20 million people given the vaccine so far worldwide. \\u201CThe committee has come to a clear scientific conclusion,\\u201D she said. \\u201CThis is a safe and effective vaccine.\\u201D But Sabine Straus, chair of the PRAC, said experts had been unable to rule out a link to 18 cases of a condition called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and seven cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), both seen together with reduced blood platelet counts. In CVST, clots can prevent blood from draining from the brain, leading to hemorrhages. DIC is a condition in which clots form in many tiny blood vessels throughout the body, which could lead to severe organ damage. EMA will continue investigating these incidents and possible links to the vaccine. But Cooke stressed that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine in protecting people from COVID-19, which is currently killing thousands of Europeans each week, far outweigh any risk of clotting. \\u201CWhat the committee has therefore recommended is to raise awareness,\\u201D she said. Some experts had speculated that the clotting incidents were related to particular batches of the vaccine, but Straus said the EMA did not back this theory. \\u201CPRAC has found no evidence of a quality or a batch issue,\\u201D she said. On Thursday, the White House confirmed reports that the Biden administration will ship 2.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Mexico and 1.5 million to Canada. Those shots will be from the existing domestic supplies that are awaiting FDA authorization, which could come as soon as next month after a major US trial of the vaccine concludes. The move follows a request for the doses from Mexico earlier this week. Biden had told reporters on Thursday that the US is discussing shipping any excess doses overseas once domestic vaccination is completed. A top FDA official, Peter Marks, testified in Congress on Wednesday that his agency has some concern about exporting too many excess doses just in case vaccine immunity proves to be short-lived and booster shots are needed for the US population. Others have speculated whether AstraZeneca\\u2019s vaccine will create more problems in the US, as anti-vaxxers have seized on the problems in its rollout. \\u201CDoes it really have a niche to fill? Would it be trusted enough? Or is it going to be just another headache?\\u201D John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York who works on vaccine development, told BuzzFeed News earlier this week."},{"author":"Peter Aldhous","title":"AstraZeneca\u2019s Vaccine Faces Blood Clot Concerns","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/peteraldhous\/astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-blood-clots","content":"Germany, France, Italy, and Spain have all halted vaccinations with AstraZeneca\\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, following reports of rare blood clots in people given the shots. These moves by the four largest countries in the European Union follow pauses in several smaller member nations \\u2014 and mark a new crisis in confidence for an affordable vaccine that is seen as the best hope of accelerating COVID-19 vaccination across the developing world. Experts stress that there is still no clear evidence that the vaccine is causing these reported clots, and the cases are being investigated by regulators. But the latest concerns follow earlier questions from scientists over how the company has communicated issues with the safety and efficacy of its vaccine. It also comes shortly before AstraZeneca is expected to release results from a large-scale clinical trial that will determine whether the FDA authorizes the vaccine for use in the US. The pauses to vaccination in Europe were triggered by reports of three hospitalizations, including one patient who died, among people given the vaccine in Norway, and a further death in Denmark. In a statement issued on March 11, the European Medicines Agency \\u2014 the regulator that is the EU\\u2019s equivalent of the FDA \\u2014 said there had been a total of 30 cases of \\u201Cthromboembolic events,\\u201D or blood clots, among the 5 million people who have received AstraZeneca shots in the EU. \\u201CThere is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine,\\u201D the EMA said. \\u201CThe position of EMA\\u2019s safety committee \\u2026 is that the vaccine\\u2019s benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered.\\u201D AstraZeneca said that there had been a total of 37 reported cases of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, both conditions caused by blood clotting, which is fewer than would be expected from the rate in the general population. \\u201CAround 17 million people in the EU and UK have now received our vaccine, and the number of cases of blood clots reported in this group is lower than the hundreds of cases that would be expected,\\u201D the company\\u2019s chief medical officer Ann Taylor said in a statement issued on March 14. And the World Health Organization is urging countries to keep using the vaccine, echoing that there is no evidence that it causes blood clots. WHO experts are meeting to discuss the reports of blood clots on Tuesday.However, a handful of incidents are giving some countries pause. According to German health minister Jens Spahn, there have been seven reported cases of a rare condition, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), out of the 1.6 million people given the AstraZeneca vaccine in Germany. The Paul Ehrlich Institute, part of the German health ministry, said Monday that it was concerned that the condition was reported alongside unusual bleeding and a low count of blood platelets, which form clots and prevent bleeding. The handful of cases seen in Germany so far would be more than expected, but could be a statistical fluke. \\u201C[T]he probability of such a statistical clustering for one outcome is actually quite high even when no cause and effect exists,\\u201D said Paul Hunter, specialist in public health at the University of East Anglia, in a comment distributed through the UK\\u2019s Science Media Centre. The EMA is meeting to discuss the concerns about blood clotting on Tuesday and is expected to release its conclusions on Thursday. A prolonged hiatus in vaccination would be a worrying prospect, given that COVID-19 cases are rising again in several EU nations \\u2014 with Italy experiencing a particularly alarming surge \\u2014 as more contagious variants spread. Experts contacted by BuzzFeed News said that, without knowing more about the patients\\u2019 cases, there wasn\\u2019t enough evidence to draw clear conclusions about whether the vaccine caused clotting. \\u201CWe would want to know the age of the cases, their prior medical history, and conditions that might predispose their risk for either a clot or a bleed,\\u201D said Orly Vardeny of the University of Minnesota, a pharmacist who specializes in cardiac health. \\u201CIt may or not be vaccine-related. If it is vaccine-related, and if it\\u2019s not being seen everywhere, the most likely explanation would be a production batch issue,\\u201D John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York who works on vaccine development, told BuzzFeed News. (Some countries, including Austria, have specifically halted vaccination from particular batches of the AstraZeneca vaccine.) The new concerns are the latest in a series of stumbles for AstraZeneca\\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, which was developed at the University of Oxford. Back in November, AstraZeneca claimed in a press release that its vaccine was 70% effective overall, and could be up to 90% effective if given in a half dose for the first of two shots. But many scientists were skeptical, especially after the drug company admitted that this regime was the result of a dosing miscalculation. AstraZeneca later added to the confusion by changing its explanation for the claimed 90% efficacy from the dosing itself to the lag between the two doses. A more serious blow came in February, when trials in South Africa showed the vaccine wasn\\u2019t effective against the more contagious variant of the coronavirus circulating there. South Africa abruptly halted plans to use AstraZeneca\\u2019s vaccine and switched instead to vaccines made by Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer\\\/BioNTech. Now scientists are waiting for the results of a large trial of the AstraZeneca vaccine conducted in the US and other countries that will be the cornerstone of the company\\u2019s application to have the vaccine authorized for use by the FDA. But some experts wonder whether adding AstraZeneca\\u2019s to the armory of vaccines being used in the US will create more problems, with anti-vaxxers likely to seize on the negative publicity surrounding it to undermine the wider vaccination drive. \\u201CDoes it really have a niche to fill? Would it be trusted enough? Or is it going to be just another headache?\\u201D said Moore. Children\\u2019s Health Defense, an organization that has peddled misinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccines for years, has already highlighted the news that several European countries are pausing their use of the vaccine. Where the vaccine could make a huge difference is in the developing world, especially in Africa, where vaccine rollout is lagging far behind. The Biden Administration is already under pressure to donate already-manufactured doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to poorer nations, the New York Times reported on March 11. Meanwhile, COVAX \\u2014 the collaboration formed by the WHO, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to provide affordable vaccines to poorer countries \\u2014 is relying on using AstraZeneca\\u2019s vaccine to deliver hundreds of millions of doses across the developing world. \\u201CSafety is our paramount concern: We know that national authorities and the WHO are monitoring the situation closely and the COVAX Facility will be following their guidance and recommendation,\\u201D a spokesperson for Gavi said in response to queries from BuzzFeed News. \\u201CCurrently no causal link has been established between the vaccine and thromboembolic events in individuals, and the vaccine remains an important and effective public health tool in the fight against this pandemic.\\u201D"},{"author":"Zahra Hirji","title":"Deb Haaland Is First Native American Interior Secretary","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/zahrahirji\/deb-haaland-first-native-american-interior-secretary","content":"The Senate on Monday evening voted 51\\u201340 to confirm Deb Haaland as secretary of the Department of the Interior, making her the first Native American to run the agency and serve in the US Cabinet. Haaland will lead the agency of around 60,000 staffers tasked with overseeing millions of acres of federal lands. Haaland\\u2019s confirmation comes after months of tense debate between conservatives \\u2014 alarmed by Haaland\\u2019s protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline and her support for the Green New Deal \\u2014 and environmental and Indigenous activists, who cheered the appointment of an Interior head committed to protecting the environment. \\u201CThis is all of our country. This is our mother \\u2014 you\\u2019ve heard the Earth referred to as Mother Earth,\\u201D Haaland told Congress during her confirmation hearing. \\u201CIt\\u2019s difficult to not feel obligated to protect this land and I feel that every Indigenous person in this country understands that.\\u201D Haaland became the representative of the 1st District of New Mexico in 2019, making her one of the first women Native Americans elected into Congress. That year, she received the most bipartisan support for her bills compared to other first-year Congress members, according to GovTrack\\u2019s 2019 report card. Despite this record of working across the aisle, only 4 Republicans in the Senate voted for her confirmation, along with 47 Democrats. During Haaland\\u2019s confirmation hearing, Republican senators such as Steve Daines of Montana repeatedly referred to her as a \\u201Cradical\\u201D for her support of policies that tackle the climate crisis and expand conservation, including her proposal to protect 30% of US lands and ocean waters from development by 2030, a target the Biden administration has since adopted. Daines then tried to stall her confirmation vote. These same environmental advocacy efforts won her praise from progressive groups, including the Sunrise Movement. Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, summed up the controversy surrounding Haaland\\u2019s confirmation hearing, saying: \\u201CI almost feel like your nomination is a proxy fight over the future of fossil fuels.\\u201D Haaland has long been a vocal critic of the oil and gas industry, telling the Guardian in an interview in 2019, \\u201CI am wholeheartedly against fracking and drilling on public lands.\\u201D In 2016, Haaland also spent four days at the Standing Rock Sioux camps supporting the protests to block the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline. Speaking about that experience to the High Plains Reader, Haaland said, \\u201CI felt like we really had hit on an environmental movement that was deep and meaningful.\\u201DAs Biden\\u2019s interior secretary, Haaland will lead an agency in charge of hundreds of national parks, monuments, and wildlife refuges, as well as energy and mineral development on public lands and in national waters. The Biden administration has already put the agency at the center of his climate agenda, pausing new federal leases for oil and gas development as the DOI reviews ways to cut its carbon footprint. These early moves stand in stark contrast to the Trump administration\\u2019s DOI, which aggressively approved new leases for coal, natural gas, and oil development across public lands and waters, even shrinking federal monuments and unraveling wildlife refuge protections to do so. Over the past four years, \\u201Cyou really saw the federal fossil fuel program really go off the rails,\\u201D said Julia Bernal of the New Mexico community organization Pueblo Action Alliance. \\u201CNothing about the Trump administration had to do with land or cultural resource conservation or water conservation.\\u201D The DOI plays a significant role in handling US relations with Indigenous groups, overseeing the Bureau of Indian Affairs that provides services to 574 federally recognized tribes. So advocates for Indigenous people across the country celebrated Haaland\\u2019s new role. \\u201CThe Department of the Interior sets the tone of the government's relationships with Native American tribal nations,\\u201D Ronnie Jo Horse, executive director of the community organization Western Native Voice and a member of Oglala Lakota Nation, told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CIn the past, decisions were made by not knowing anything about tribal nations and what we face daily,\\u201D she said, adding that Haaland\\u2019s \\u201Cglass breaking\\u201D confirmation changes that. \\u201CShe comes from the same place we do so, so she\\u2019s familiar with the issues we face.\\u201D Bernal, a tribal member of Sandia Pueblo, said she was hopeful Haaland would make climate change a central part of her leadership efforts. \\u201CHaving Deb Haaland, an Indigenous woman, brings a new feminist perspective in how we need to manage land, natural resources, and water because we\\u2019re having to come up with new mitigation strategies to absorb the shock of climate change,\\u201D Bernal said, later adding: \\u201CDeb is like our auntie.

But newly released tax filings obtained by BuzzFeed News show that in 2019 the company accepted more than $4 million from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, a major US oil trade organization that even Shell and BP had recently dumped for its aggressive opposition to popular climate solutions. \\\"Edelman is basically misleading the public about its so-called green reputation,\\u201D Robert Brulle, an environmental sociologist at Brown University who studies climate lobbying and advertising, told BuzzFeed News. The global public relations powerhouse has roughly 6,000 employees working to \\u201Cpromote and protect\\u201D prominent brands like Ikea, KFC, and Dove. Selling its own socially conscious image, the company has repeatedly stressed its commitment to efforts to \\u201Creduce emissions,\\u201D \\u201Cwork with an environmental conscience,\\u201D and \\u201Clead in the transition to sustainable and socially responsible business models.\\u201D On its website, Edelman proudly declares it worked with cleantech companies \\u201Clong before climate change became a buzzword.\\u201D But in recent years, Edelman has faced a backlash, both publicly and internally, over its willingness to take on high-profile campaigns for clients that are big polluters. After four high-level executives quit in 2015 citing this issue, the firm publicly pledged never to work with coal clients or climate deniers. The vague commitment left the door open to a broad range of work for fossil fuel businesses or companies that have fought against regulations cutting carbon pollution. \\u201CRight now the only categorical exclusion we have is on climate denial and coal,\\u201D Michael Stewart, then a top Edelman executive, told the Guardian in 2015. \\u201CWhen you are trying in some way to obfuscate the truth or use misinformation and half-truths that is what we would consider getting into the work of greenwashing, and that is something we would never propose or work we would support our client doing.\\u201D But AFPM, a trade group that pulled in more than $55 million in revenue in 2019 alone, has aggressively opposed climate action and provided funding to the Heartland Institute, a climate denial group. AFPM has paid Edelman at least $12 million for public relations work from 2017 to 2019, tax filings show. AFPM has taken some of the most extreme positions among fossil fuel trade groups, including helping create Energy4Us, a group that ran Facebook ads supporting the Trump administration\\u2019s rollbacks of national fuel efficiency standards without initially disclosing its ties to the oil and gas industry. The trade group also helped fund a campaign opposing a carbon tax in Washington state. The trade group\\u2019s hardline climate policies prompted Royal Dutch Shell to announce in the spring of 2019 that it would not be renewing its AFPM membership, followed by the French oil company Total and the UK giant BP. All three oil companies, which are among the world\\u2019s top climate polluters, cited the trade group\\u2019s opposition to a carbon tax and lack of support for the Paris climate agreement in their decisions to quit. AFPM is \\u201Cnot technically denying climate change but they might as well be,\\u201D said Andrew Logan, senior director of the oil and gas industry program at the corporate sustainability group Ceres. \\u201CThe only way to understand their policy positioning,\\u201D Logan added, \\u201Cis that they will support any policy that encourages more use of oil products and they will oppose any policy that would lead to less consumption of oil products.\\u201D Edelman did not respond to multiple requests for comment about what PR work it did for AFPM or if the group is still one of its clients. AFPM also did not respond to a list of detailed questions from BuzzFeed News. But in a statement, it said, \\u201CWe advocate for public policies that enable our members to safely and sustainably provide the fuels and petrochemicals that the world\\u2019s growing populations and economies need to thrive.\\u201D The trade association added, \\u201CWe unequivocally acknowledge that climate change is real and that we have a role to play in reducing global GHG emissions.\\u201DThe fossil fuel industry is a huge potential source of revenue for public relations firms. Research by the Brown sociologist Brulle found that five big oil companies combined have \\u201Cspent nearly $3.6 billion in advertising purposes for corporation promotion\\u201D from 1986 to 2015. In addition to Edelman, AFPM paid another public relations firm, Singer Associates, roughly $14.5 million from 2017 to 2019. Singer Associates, based in San Francisco, has worked closely with Chevron on an \\u201Caggressive\\u201D crisis campaign after it was accused of environmental damage in Ecuador. Singer Associates also led a public relations campaign aimed at improving perception of Chevron's Bay Area refinery, where a 2012 fire led roughly 15,000 local residents in a low-income community to seek medical treatment. Singer Associates \\u201Cis honored to work for AFPM and Chevron,\\u201D Sam Singer, the firm\\u2019s president, told BuzzFeed News in an email, adding: \\u201COur agency supports the Paris Agreement and is committed to helping to address climate change. Our work for AFPM and Chevron reflects our philosophy and beliefs.\\u201D \\u201CAs a policy, we do not discuss the details of work we perform for our clients,\\u201D Singer continued. \\u201CWith that said, we did not work on Energy4Us.\\u201D Edelman also did not respond to questions about whether it was involved in the Energy4Us campaign. Edelman recently became a target of a public pressure campaign dubbed \\u201CClean Creatives,\\u201D which is trying to get public relations firms and ad agencies to commit to refusing future contracts with fossil fuel companies, trade associations, and front groups.

Despite expanding vaccine eligibility to all adults by the beginning of May, the president and senior administration officials stressed that they expect the US won\\u2019t have enough vaccine supply for all adults until the end of the month. \\\"All adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1,\\\" Biden said in a national address on the one-year anniversary of the pandemic being declared. \\\"That's much earlier than expected. Let me be clear: That doesn't mean everyone's going to have that shot immediately, but it means you'll be able to get in line beginning May 1.\\\" The announcement marks a sharp shift toward federal control over the pandemic response. So far, individual states have largely been tasked with leading vaccine rollout and setting eligibility requirements. More than 98 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered in the US so far, and 20 million doses are being shipped each week, roughly double the numbers of when the president took office. The Biden administration hopes this next push will help get the nation back to a more normal place by July 4. In a briefing Thursday afternoon, administration officials said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will continue to issue public health guidance on small gatherings according to vaccination pace and scientific research. The president's call also steps over a CDC panel's recommendations, which only in the last month called for vaccinating frontline workers and those 65 and older. Officials added that Biden is clear that gatherings would only become possible if Americans continue to wear masks and receive vaccinations when they\\u2019re eligible. \\u201CThis isn\\u2019t just an automatic thing,\\u201D the official added. \\u201CThe president will talk about small gatherings like a barbecue in your backyard or in your neighborhood,\\u201D an official said. \\u201CHe will be clear that does not mean large events where lots of people gather but it does mean that we can once again have an Independence Day, small gatherings, and celebrations.\\u201D The administration is planning to combine expanded vaccine eligibility with efforts to ramp up vaccination sites across the country by doubling the number of pharmacies where people can get vaccinated, expanding community health centers, and doubling the number of federal mass vaccination sites. Biden will also deploy more than 4,000 additional US soldiers to assist in vaccination efforts and will vastly expand the pool of people eligible to administer vaccinations. The official said that the pool would include dentists, paramedics, physician assistants, veterinarians, and medical and healthcare students. The administration plans to open a call center and launch a federally funded national website to find vaccine appointments by May 1. Senior administration officials said the White House will also offer support to improve state-run vaccination websites. Biden moved this week to order another 100 million doses of the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine with the aim of immunizing schoolchildren in the fall. This followed the brokered partnership between Johnson & Johnson and Merck, which will increase the manufacturing of those shots.

So did 16 Republicans, including both Senators from Regan's home state of North Carolina. \\u201CDuring his time working for North Carolina, Secretary Regan demonstrated his commitment to sound environmental stewardship and to building constructive relationships with those who may have different points of view,\\\" Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina said in a statement. \\\"I applaud the Senate\\u2019s bipartisan support of this qualified nominee, and look forward to working with him in this new role.\\u201D Regan is inheriting an agency in disarray. The Trump administration rolled back dozens of the EPA\\u2019s air, climate, and water protections; prioritized big polluters while sidelining career experts; took down hundreds of references to climate change on the agency\\u2019s websites; and publicly chastised the agency. In response, more than 800 staffers have left, and morale among those who have stayed is at a record low. Now Regan is tasked with rebuilding the agency while simultaneously moving full speed ahead with President Joe Biden\\u2019s ambitious plans to tackle the climate crisis, which include passing rules to cut greenhouse gas emissions and hold polluters accountable. So far, the Biden administration has already identified more than 100 Trump-era environmental regulations to possibly reverse, including 48 from the EPA. Biden has ordered the reinstatement of science advisory boards disbanded by Trump officials, launched a review of scientific integrity standards across the government, and directed every agency, including the EPA, to identify ways to cut its own carbon footprint. Biden created a national climate task force led by his department heads, including Regan, to coordinate a federal response to the climate crisis for the first time. He also directed the US to rejoin the Paris climate agreement as one of his first acts as president. Regan, an EPA alum, spent the past four years serving as secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, where he helped negotiate one of the nation\\u2019s largest coal ash spill settlements and created the state\\u2019s first-ever Environmental Justice and Equity Advisory Board. Before that, he was a top climate official and Southeast regional director of the Environmental Defense Fund. \\u201CEnvironmental justice is something that is near and dear to my heart,\\u201D Regan told Congress. \\u201CWhat I plan to do, first and foremost, is find the resources and establish an environmental justice adviser to the administrator.\\u201D Among his other initial actions, Regan has pledged to do a damage assessment of the last four years. But many EPA staffers have warned that rebuilding the agency will be challenging. \\u201CWhile EPA workers have great hope for the Biden administration,\\u201D Gary Morton, an EPA union president, told Congress on Wednesday, \\u201Cthe fact is that the EPA was decimated after four years of nonstop attacks from the Trump administration.\\u201D"},{"author":"Dan Vergano","title":"The CDC Has Released Guidelines For Vaccinated People","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/danvergano\/cdc-vaccinated-guidelines-indoors","content":"The CDC released pandemic safety recommendations for vaccinated people on Monday, allowing them to meet indoors with each other without masks or with one other household of unvaccinated people if they are at a low risk of serious illnesses. The release of the long-awaited guidelines comes as US COVID-19 vaccinations have increased nationwide. About 59 million people have now received at least one shot. More than 90 million vaccine doses have been shipped nationwide. \\u201CThe recommendations issued today are just a first step,\\u201D CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a White House briefing. Whether vaccinated people can get sick and transmit an infection is the big open question that will shape recommendations moving forward, she said. For that reason, vaccinated people should still wear masks. \\u201CYou can visit your grandparents if you have been vaccinated and they have been too.\\u201DHere is what the new CDC guidelines lay out:The recommendations did not change guidelines to avoid travel. \\\"Every time that there's a surge in travel, we have a surge in cases in this country,\\\" Walensky said. \\\"We know that many of our variants have emerged out from international places, and we know that the travel corridor is a place where people are mixing a lot. So we're really trying to restrain travel at this current period of time.\\\" The more contagious B.1.1.7 variant of the coronavirus, which was first spotted in the United Kingdom, continues to show up in testing in the US and is expected to become the predominant strain of the virus in the country this month. Vaccines look just as effective against the variant as the original coronavirus, but health experts, including National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony Fauci, have stressed the need to take both shots of the two-shot vaccines to ensure full protection against variants. The vaccines \\u2014 including the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine authorized last month \\u2014 take two weeks to go into full effect.The CDC also released a report on Monday confirming that obesity, particularly in those 65 and older, was a significant risk factor for severe cases of COVID-19, raising the odds of being put on a ventilator or dying. The finding supports a medical hypothesis that both body fat and underlying conditions frequently seen among the overweight, such as diabetes, may contribute to the inflammation of the immune system that often causes death in COVID-19 patients."},{"author":"Dan Vergano","title":"Why Don't We Have More COVID-19 Drugs?","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/danvergano\/coronavirus-treatments-antivirals-fauci","content":"Even as vaccines roll out, the pandemic\\u2019s holy grail \\u2014 a drug to successfully treat COVID-19 \\u2014 continues to elude medicine. On Monday, a World Health Organization panel called for scientists to quit researching hydroxychloroquine, the poster child for drugs that failed to work against the coronavirus. Meanwhile, more than 40,000 people are still hospitalized nationwide with COVID-19, and only a handful of mediocre therapies can help treat them. And with new variants threatening to thwart vaccines, finding drugs to fight SARS-CoV-2 is all the more urgent. \\u201CThe bottom line of what we need to do looking forward, and the clear need in this, is the development of potent antivirals directly acting on SARS-CoV-2,\\u201D Anthony Fauci, chief of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a White House briefing last week. Antivirals would revolutionize the fight against SARS-CoV-2, since they block viruses from replicating and can stop people from getting very sick or dying. But efforts to develop such drugs have languished because of a lack of funding and coordination: While Operation Warp Speed devoted nearly $18.75 billion to develop vaccines, it only set aside $6.34 billion for drugs. Instead, scientists tried to repurpose older drugs, including antivirals for other diseases, to see if they worked against COVID-19. \\u201CEveryone was looking for a quick fix,\\u201D Fauci told BuzzFeed News. The FDA has so far only authorized one drug to treat COVID-19, remdesivir, initially developed against Ebola. But it is far from a perfect drug: Results on how it affects the length of hospital stays have been mixed, and it has not been shown to reduce deaths. \\u201CThere's nothing wrong with looking for quick fixes, but you'll also have to make the long-term investment,\\u201D Fauci said, noting the search for effective new drugs would take anywhere from months to a year. The goal would be to develop drugs that are explicitly designed and targeted to SARS-CoV-2 like the \\u201Cspectacularly successful\\u201D ones made against HIV and hepatitis C, which made the deadly diseases treatable, he said. But that\\u2019s not happening yet. After evaluating hundreds of older drugs, the National Institutes of Health has no new antivirals for COVID-19 in its public-private partnership of clinical trials, called Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV). There are no newly designed antivirals listed among the 160 NIH-supported clinical trials registered by the National Library of Medicine. Operation Warp Speed\\u2019s \\u201Cmedical countermeasures\\u201D effort also contains no new antivirals. The only new treatments on the ACTIV list are monoclonal antibodies \\u2014 like the ones former president Donald Trump took \\u2014 which are difficult to give patients because they require hourlong transfusions near the start of an illness. (\\\"HHS is working to increase awareness of the therapeutics and provide [monoclonal antibodies] to more types of sites,\\\" according to an agency statement. Agency figures suggest monoclonal antibody use for outpatients at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 has risen to approximately 34%, up from 20% in December.)The most successful repurposed drug in the pandemic has been dexamethasone, a steroid invented in 1957 \\u2014 so long ago that Fauci said he prescribed it in graduate school. Instead of attacking the coronavirus, dexamethasone suppresses the immune system, which can turn the body against itself and attack vital organs in the later stages of COVID-19. This cheap and safe drug lowered deaths among COVID-19 patients on ventilators by about a third, a compelling argument to look for another needle in the haystack of older drugs that could work directly against the virus. \\u201CThere\\u2019s a lot of reasons to use those FDA-approved medications, because they have already known properties in human patients,\\u201D said Texas A&M biochemist Wenshe Ray Liu, who is researching both new and repurposed drugs to fight the coronavirus. And testing them is relatively easy: Companies just have to dose infected cells in test tubes with their library of existing drugs and pull out the ones that seem to block SARS-CoV-2. Because they've already been vetted, the winners can go straight into clinical trials without extensive studies to show they are safe. Clinical trials are expensive, Liu added, and pharmaceutical companies prefer to test drugs they\\u2019ve already spent money to develop. For both of those reasons, drug companies have largely pursued small clinical trials with too few patients to show that their own drugs worked, hoping to hit a home run. Those patients have little incentive to sign up to test the experimental drugs at the early stages of the disease when they aren\\u2019t terribly sick. Molnupiravir, an antiviral designed to fight the flu, is an example of the challenges facing clinical trials to test promising drugs. Safety trials this summer looked promising for the drug, and the drug company Merck started a larger clinical trial of 1,300 patients in October to see if it will lower virus levels. It is expected to end in December 2021, taking three to four times longer than vaccine trials that enrolled tens of thousands of people. On top of other challenges, the study measures reduced viral loads rather than improved patients\\u2019 symptoms, which might not convince the FDA of its benefits. These kinds of hurdles are one reason that repurposed drugs haven\\u2019t shown much benefit in patients. And while NIH-funded trials are studying more than a dozen old drugs for diseases such as arthritis, cancer, malaria, hepatitis, or gout to see if they can fight SARS-CoV-2, the only antiviral besides remdesivir in ACTIV's clinical trials is a Japanese pancreatitis drug developed in the 1980s. Results from that trial, which started last August, are projected for the end of this year. Results from smaller trials for molnupiravir should come sooner, said University of North Carolina virologist Victor Garcia-Martinez, who led a February study showing the drug was very effective in mice equipped with human lung tissue. Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, which is developing the drug with Merck, presented some preliminary results from that trial in 202 hospitalized adults at a scientific conference on Saturday morning. Those showed a quicker decrease in virus levels on nasal swabs of patients who took the drug, compared to those who didn't. The firm hopes to present full results showing whether the drug completely eliminated the virus faster at an upcoming medical meeting. If it eventually proves effective, Garcia-Martinez said, \\u201CThis will be easy to manufacture and distribute. Particularly if there is an outbreak, say, in a nursing home, you can get it right away to people.\\u201DMany drugs regularly hobble viruses in test tubes, even other coronaviruses, said drug researcher Martin Michaelis of the University of Kent in the United Kingdom. Scientists were initially optimistic that these drugs would similarly work against SARS-CoV-2, but this virus is different enough that most of those drugs may not be effective. In a recent study, Michaelis and colleagues laid out the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and its closest human-infecting relative, the SARS virus, which killed 774 people after the 2002 outbreak. While they are about 80% similar genetically, the two viruses differ in the biological machinery they use to replicate inside cells, Michaelis and his colleagues found. That\\u2019s important because interfering with this viral replication is a main task of antiviral drugs. If viruses can\\u2019t replicate, they can\\u2019t spread. Although the spikes on the outside of the coronavirus are now mutating wildly to produce more contagious variants, the virus has less freedom to change its reproductive process, Michaelis said. That\\u2019s because the same machinery is also vital in other basic viral functions, making it a more reliable target for drugs taking aim at the virus. \\u201CYou can\\u2019t say these conserved regions will never mutate,\\u201D he said, \\u201Cbut it is a lower probability.\\u201D Examples of new antivirals designed specifically against SARS-CoV-2 are now turning up in animal studies. A Feb. 18 report by Chinese researchers in the journal Science found that two drugs successfully reduced viral loads in the lungs of mice. And there are other signs we may find helpful COVID-19 drugs. A year into the pandemic, scientists know much more about how SARS-CoV-2 works and may be better equipped to find existing drugs that could attack it, Texas A&M\\u2019s Liu said. His team recently found a high blood pressure drug that in a computer simulation fits like a key in a lock to the coronavirus. The drug may have been overlooked because it\\u2019s a generic and doesn\\u2019t have a corporate sponsor willing to invest in a clinical trial. \\u201CWe\\u2019ll try to start our own clinical trial if we can\\u2019t find a corporate sponsor,\\u201D Liu said.On March 11, 2020, the day that the pandemic was first declared by the WHO, Fauci testified to Congress that there were two avenues for medicine to address the coronavirus: vaccines or drugs. From a scientific perspective, there were a lot of reasons to have expected an effective antiviral drug to turn up sooner than a vaccine, Fauci told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CYou generally know relatively quickly whether a [drug] treatment works or not because you're giving a treatment to somebody that's already sick,\\u201D he said. A vaccine, meanwhile, requires giving real shots and placebos to tens of thousands of people and then waiting until natural infections cause enough infections to show it\\u2019s effective. \\u201CWe were fortunate in that we had a couple of vaccine candidates that were red-hot and really turned out to be good,\\u201D Fauci said. \\u201CAnd unfortunately for the country, but fortunately for the vaccine trials, we continued to have a high level of infection, which allowed us to get an answer pretty quickly.\\u201D Vaccines trigger a well-understood natural immune reaction, making their design and safety testing more straightforward compared to new antivirals, Michaelis added. But the US vaccine trials also had significantly more funding than ones for treatments. \\u201CThere is not that much money in antiviral drugs for acute diseases that are only used for a week or so,\\u201D Michaelis said. The lack of a clear path means new antivirals designed explicitly against the coronavirus will likely require a big public investment, Fauci said. The NIH only recently started an initiative to research new antivirals, which would be \\u201Cunlikely to provide therapeutics in 2021,\\u201D NIH chief Francis Collins told the New York Times. In some ways, the lack of COVID-19 antivirals underscores just how lucky humanity is to have effective vaccines, Michaelis said. \\u201CPeople tried many, many compounds against SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, but they just haven\\u2019t had the big, big, successful candidate so far,\\u201D he said. Forging ahead to create new drugs, he added, \\u201Cbecomes tougher and harder work.\\u201D"},{"author":"Craig Silverman","title":"Nigerian Influencers Are Being Paid To Tweet About Alex Saab","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/craigsilverman\/nigerian-twitter-campaign-alex-saab","content":"As an alleged money launderer who worked with the Venezuelan government and is fighting an extradition order to the United States, Alex Saab has some unlikely allies. Since mid-January, #FreeAlexSaab has been a rallying cry among Nigerians on Twitter, thanks to a broad influence operation with connections to employees of a Nigerian PR firm and a UK-based nonprofit called Digital Good Governance for Africa. The campaign paid influencers to tweet about Saab in an effort to sway public opinion and court proceedings in Nigeria and Cape Verde, the African island nation where Saab is currently under house arrest. Saab is a Colombian businessperson whom a Florida court charged with money laundering in 2019, following related charges in Colombia two months prior. He is also alleged to have helped the Venezuelan government of Nicolás Maduro evade sanctions via fuel and gold trading. While Saab was traveling from Venezuela to Iran in June 2020, officials in Cape Verde arrested him when his plane stopped to get refueled. He denies all charges. His lawyers say his detention violates international law because Venezuela named him a \\u201Cspecial envoy,\\u201D which provided him diplomatic immunity, and because the Interpol red notice calling for his arrest was issued after he was detained in Cape Verde. In addition to legal maneuvers, Saab\\u2019s supporters have been using Twitter to argue his case, violating the platform\\u2019s rules in the process. In response to an investigation by BuzzFeed News and the Digital Africa Research Lab (DigiAfricaLab), Twitter suspended more than 1,500 accounts this week for manipulating the #FreeAlexSaab hashtag. That includes almost all 40 accounts that BuzzFeed News and DigiAfricaLab connected to the paid campaign, as well as that of a prominent Nigerian influencer with more than 1.5 million followers who offered to pay people who engaged with her tweets about Saab. Twitter also suspended the accounts of three Nigerian journalists: a reporter for the Nigerian Tribune and a reporter and freelance contributor to TheCable. Their supportive tweets about Saab tagged an account, @Fernand47588665, which sources and an internal campaign document say was used to track the campaign. The reporters all told BuzzFeed News they did not receive payment to show support for Saab, and TheCable said it did not participate in the Saab campaign. The findings expose how Twitter's trending topics continue to be affected by global manipulation campaigns and illustrate how professional marketing firms are frequently implicated in social media influence operations. The campaign also provides a window into the booming, shady Twitter influencer industry in Nigeria, in which people often accept money to promote brands, causes, and hashtags without disclosing they are part of paid campaigns. \\\"Engaging in platform manipulation \\u2014 regardless of the intent \\u2014 is a violation of the Twitter Rules. This includes gaming hashtags, artificially boosting content, or paying for fake engagement,\\u201D a company spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CAs a result of these behaviors, we\\u2019ve suspended more than 1,500 accounts associated with these hashtags and our investigations continue.\\u201DRosemary Ajayi, a researcher at the Digital Africa Research Lab, said the Saab campaign shows how common it has become for Twitter hashtags and discussions in Nigeria to be manipulated by influencers. \\u201CThe influencer industry has quickly become a hotbed of fraud and discourse manipulation,\\u201D Ajayi said. \\u201CWhether you\\u2019re looking to promote a new album or a church event or settle the score with an adversary, many PR firms and consultants operating within the Nigerian influencer ecosystem will recruit influencers to deliver this for a fee, no questions asked.\\u201DBeginning in January, a small group of Nigerian influencers and human rights advocates received a Saab campaign briefing document produced on the letterhead of Digital Good Governance for Africa (DIGA). DIGA is a UK nonprofit led by Naji Makarem, a professor of international development at University College London, and Christian Elemele, a Nigerian expat and social entrepreneur who previously studied at UCL. Founded in 2019, it is currently working on a project to bring digital voting to Nigeria for the country\\u2019s 2023 elections. The document outlined a social media campaign that would recruit influencers in Nigeria, Ghana, and Senegal to tweet in support of Saab and help generate public outcry about his case. It said participating influencers were expected to post twice per week for the initial one-month campaign, from Jan. 18 to Feb. 18. \\u201CThe influencer is expected to use the hashtags #FreeAlexSaab and tag prominent Nigerians, Ghanians and Sengalese handles from government, business, celebrities, activists etc. which will be provided to the influencer,\\u201D the five-page document reads. It instructed influencers to engage with replies to their posts about Saab and to tag the @wakandanomics Twitter account if they needed additional information. That account does not list a full name but used a photo of Elemele as its avatar. Elemele is also the cofounder of a nonprofit called Wakanda Social Enterprise. Elemele and Makarem did not respond to multiple emails or to a detailed list of questions from BuzzFeed News. After BuzzFeed News reached out, Elemele\\u2019s photo was removed from the @wakandanomics account. By Jan. 20, the hashtag #FreeAlexSaab was gaining steam on Twitter, thanks to Nigerian accounts that often tweeted the same articles and images, tagged the same accounts, interacted with one another, and expressed unwavering support for Saab. The tweets intensified in March as the Court of Justice of the Economic Community of West African States, based in Abuja, Nigeria, prepared to rule on his case. It decided in Saab's favor, but the case continues in Cape Verde. Five sources with knowledge of the Saab campaign said that 40 Nigerian influencers, which have more than a million followers in total, were recruited to participate by at least two employees of Alpha Reach, a PR firm run by Japheth \\u201CJJ\\u201D Omojuwa. Omojuwa, a prominent Nigerian influencer with 1 million followers on Twitter, was listed in the DIGA document as one of the people the campaign hoped to recruit. Omojuwa told BuzzFeed News that \\u201Ca friend in the UK\\u201D connected to the Saab campaign contacted him, and that he declined to participate \\u2014 aside from posting a few supportive tweets. \\u201CI said to this person in confidence that I support the mission and would be happy to retweet a couple articles, but I would not personally be part of it,\\u201D he said. Omojuwa cited his \\u201Cstrong relationship\\u201D with the US Embassy in Nigeria as a reason why he did not want to be seen as advocating for Saab\\u2019s release, but he said it was \\u201Cpossible\\u201D employees at his firm worked on it. \\u201CI don\\u2019t think I can start to have a conversation about whether Alpha is involved. If they are, there have definitely been some form of nondisclosure [agreements],\\u201D Omojuwa said. He later issued a statement to emphasize that \\u201CAlpha Reach as an organisation was not involved in this campaign.\\u201D Ajayi said Alpha Reach employees participated in the campaign by tweeting about Saab and engaging with the influencers they helped to recruit and pay. \\u201CThey retweeted each other and developed threads around each other\\u2019s tweets using replies and quote-retweets,\\u201D she said. \\u201CThey also shared news articles and attempted to draw in unsuspecting subject matter experts by tagging their handles and asking questions.\\u201D Two Nigerian influencers on Twitter who asked not to be named for fear of repercussions told BuzzFeed News and DigiAfricaLab that Alpha Reach employees paid them to tweet about Saab, share specific content and hashtags, and tag a set of accounts in their tweets. Influencers were typically paid between $6.50 to $15 for their work, though some received more, according to sources. The influencers said participants were added to a WhatsApp group where they received direction about what to post and which tweets to engage with and tag. The campaign brief produced by DIGA said each influencer should \\u201Cbe added to a whatsapp group to better synchronise the timing of tweets.\\u201D Another influencer said an Alpha Reach employee told them to tag accounts, including those of Venezuelan political leaders. \\u201CWhat was mentioned was that [people] would be monitoring accounts participating for retweets and amplification,\\u201D the influencer said. One of those accounts is @Fernand47588665. The account was created in January, has no profile picture and fewer than 10 followers, and rarely tweets. Yet by late March, it has been tagged in more than 5,000 tweets about Saab. Two influencers and one person familiar with the paid campaign said participants were instructed to tag the @Fernand47588665 account in their Saab tweets to help the campaign track the effort.\\u201CThat Fernand account was the [primary] account that must be tagged,\\u201D said one influencer, who added that it \\u201Cfelt fishy.\\u201D They also said they were told to tag Venezuelan accounts, including those belonging to prominent politicians in the Maduro government. \\u201CIt\\u2019s highly unlikely that Nigerians would have come across this account without it being presented to them,\\u201D Ajayi said. That\\u2019s backed up by the campaign brief, which said, \\u201CThe Influencer is also expected to tag @Fernand47588665 on twitter to aid monitoring.\\u201D Twitter has temporarily restricted the @Fernand47588665 account owing to its \\u201Cunusual activity.\\u201D Both influencers who were paid to participate said they believed their tweets were relayed to people in Venezuela. They said suspicious Spanish-language accounts and those belonging to people in Venezuela engaged with their tweets via retweets, likes, and replies. \\u201CI dunno why all of a sudden I was getting spammed by lots of bot Spanish accounts,\\u201D one influencer said. Networks of suspicious accounts, some of which tweeted in Spanish, were also part of an earlier phase of the campaign to free Saab, according to the Financial Times. The paper obtained a copy of an \\u201Cintelligence\\u201D analysis from an unnamed source that concluded the Maduro government \\u201Cand\\\/or its proxies (witting or unwitting) are involved in a coordinated campaign to influence both the government of Cabo Verde and its population to obstruct Alex Saab\\u2019s extradition.\\u201D BuzzFeed News and DigiAfricaLab have not seen evidence of involvement by the Venezuelan government or its proxies, and those involved in the campaign said they do not know who funded the effort. A Twitter spokesperson said the company publicly discloses when it removes accounts that were part of state-linked operations, which it has not done in this case as of now. The report obtained by the Financial Times said that, beginning in October, a group of accounts \\u201Ctweeted extensively about Saab\\u201D for a few weeks and then stopped. A second network of 86 accounts sprang up in December. As of January, \\u201Cthe [primary] driver of that increase appears to be the deployment of Nigeria-based social media influencers,\\u201D according to the report.Along with the people who said they were recruited and paid by Alpha Reach employees, other prominent Nigerian influencers also tweeted in support of Saab. Two influencers with roughly 2 million followers between them sent tweets in March offering to pay people if they amplified a tweet about Saab or replied with the #FreeAlexSaab hashtag. On March 23, Pamilerin Adegoke, a Nigerian influencer on Twitter who has roughly half a million followers, sent a tweet asking people to \\u201Cengage my next post.\\u201D In a subsequent tweet, he asked people to sign an online petition for Saab. That tweet tagged @Fernand47588665 as well as Maduro. Adegoke later tweeted screenshots allegedly showing two payments of roughly $10 to two people. He then deleted the tweet that asked people to engage. Adegoke told BuzzFeed News that an unnamed friend asked him to tweet in support of Saab. He said he paid people to engage with his Saab tweet \\u201Cto drive traffic to the post for more people to see it, basically,\\u201D but claimed he was not paid to participate. Twitter briefly suspended his account on Monday after inquiries from BuzzFeed News. This is at least the second time Twitter has taken action against Adegoke. In 2019, it banned his verified account, @ThePamilerin. Also on March 23, Tonto Dikeh, a Nigerian actor and influencer with 1.5 million followers, tweeted, \\u201CI want to give someone who urgently needs money N25,000. Pls tell me what you will like to buy if I gift this to you. Pls add #FreeAlexSaab to your replies and you may be my next winner.\\u201D An hour later, she asked people to sign an online petition in support of Saab and offered to send money to followers if 100 people signed it. The tweets were deleted soon after they were posted, a pattern that Dikeh\\u2019s account has shown going back years, according to Ajayi. She said Dikeh and Adegoke \\u201Care both well known for their involvement in paid influencer campaigns and have a history, going back a few years, of openly offering giveaways as a means of manipulating the platform.\\u201D Reached on WhatsApp, Dikeh said that neither she nor her social media manager knew anything about the Saab tweets. \\u201CI don\\u2019t know anything about this. Free Alex Saab? Who is that?\\u201D she said before suggesting someone may have hacked her account. Her account was suspended on Tuesday. Ajayi said the account suspensions, many of which are temporary, do not address the widespread manipulation of Twitter by influencers in Nigeria, an issue that takes on more urgency with elections coming in 2023. \\u201CThese actors provide a highly sought-after service and some earn millions of naira every month. It will require more than artificial intelligence and account suspensions to stop this,\\u201D she said. \\u201CIt\\u2019s going to take a paradigm shift.\\u201D ● Jeremy Singer-Vine contributed reporting to this story."},{"author":"Ryan Mac","title":"Facebook Allows Ads To Target Users Interested In Militias","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/ryanmac\/facebook-militia-interest-category-advertisers-ban","content":"For months after it banned violent extremist groups, Facebook's advertising preference system, which lets advertisers deliver targeted ads, continued to identify and categorize some people as interested in militias. Last August, in preparation for the 2020 US presidential election, the social network said it would take down any Facebook pages, groups, and Instagram accounts \\u201Ctied to offline anarchist groups that support violent acts amidst protests, US-based militia organizations and QAnon.\\u201D More than seven months later, the company was still tracking user interest in militias for possible targeted advertising, another misstep in the already spotty and haphazard enforcement of its policy. On Monday, the Tech Transparency Project (TTP), an industry watchdog group, showed BuzzFeed News that an account it uses to follow and track right-wing extremism on Facebook had been automatically placed into \\u201Cinterest categories\\u201D for \\u201Cmilitia\\u201D and \\u201Cresistance movement.\\u201D Facebook places people in interest categories based on their on-platform activity \\u2014 including the pages they like or the ads they click on \\u2014 and allows advertisers to target ads to them based on these interests. The discovery suggests that despite its policies, Facebook, which has products that are used by more than 3 billion people globally, still struggles to manage its increasingly sprawling advertising platform. BuzzFeed News previously reported that far-right militant groups continued to run ads and operate on Facebook after the company\\u2019s ban in the run-up to the 2020 election; some targeted weapon accessory and body armor ads to people following the Jan. 6 insurrection.\\u201CWe removed this targeting term last summer and are working to understand why it could appear in Ad Preferences,\\u201D Facebook spokesperson Liz Bourgeois told BuzzFeed News.

In 2017, ProPublica found that the company had allowed advertisers to target ads to people who expressed interest in antisemitic topics, including the terms \\u201CJew hater\\u201D and \\u201CHow to burn Jews.\\u201D Last year, BuzzFeed News found that the company had been profiting from ads promoting a page for white nationalists and the Boogaloo movement, a loose collection of anti-government extremists who have called for violence and another civil war. The TTP account that tracks right-wing activity does not post or engage with the content Facebook shows it, though TTP director Katie Paul does scroll through its feed and clicks on links as part of her research. Paul designed the account to look like that of a 32-year-old man based in Texas and follows pages and groups that share pro-Trump memes, election misinformation, and outright calls for violence. Paul said she used the account to begin liking militia pages and groups in January \\u2014 which still persisted on Facebook despite the August ban \\u2014 and showed BuzzFeed News a list of the automatically generated interest categories. In addition to \\u201Cmilitia,\\u201D there were dozens of seemingly nonpolitical interests, including \\u201CMel Gibson,\\u201D \\u201CAppalachian Mountains,\\u201D and \\u201CSoft Rock.\\u201D Other interests that Facebook presumed the person would have included \\u201CTea party movement,\\u201D \\u201CRepublican Party (United States),\\u201D and \\u201CSecond Amendment to the United States Constitution.\\u201D Over the last few months, Facebook leaders, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg, have insisted Facebook does not profit from civil unrest or hate. In January, Sandberg said in an interview at a Reuters conference that Facebook had taken proactive measures to remove extremist content. \\u201CI think these events were largely organized on platforms that don\\u2019t have our abilities to stop hate, and don\\u2019t have our standards, and don\\u2019t have our transparency,\\u201D Sandberg said. \\u201CBut certainly, to this day, we are working to find any single mention that may be leading to this and making sure we get it down as quickly as possible.\\u201D People have the option to remove interest categories from their profiles, which \\u201Cprevents advertisers from reaching you by indicating that their ads should be shown to people in that specific interest category,\\u201D according to a Facebook disclaimer. People can access their interest categories from their profiles, though it takes six steps of clicking through ad settings pages before they can access the full list. \\u201CFor over a year now, Facebook has repeatedly claimed to be addressing extremism on its platform while journalists, researchers, and the public are left to clean up after their broken promises,\\u201D Paul told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CThese ad interests show that while Facebook\\u2019s promises on threats like militia are empty, its pockets are not.\\u201D Craig Silverman contributed reporting to this story."},{"author":"Caroline Haskins","title":"The NYPD Has Misled The Public About Its Use Of Facial Recognition Tool Clearview AI","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/carolinehaskins1\/nypd-has-misled-public-about-clearview-ai-use","content":"Despite statements from the NYPD in early 2020 stating that it had no relationship with the facial recognition software company Clearview AI, documents from a new public records request reveal that the company was an acknowledged vendor to the department from as early as 2018 and continued to enjoy a congenial relationship with officers on the force long after. The NYPD told BuzzFeed News in February 2020 that it \\u201Cdoes not have any contract, agreement, or relationship with Clearview AI, formally or informally.\\u201D It also told BuzzFeed News in January 2020 that it has \\u201Cno institutional relationship\\u201D with the company. However, documents obtained through a public records request submitted by Rachel Richards \\u2014 with the help of The Legal Aid Society, who litigated to get the documents \\u2014 contradict these claims. These documents, which include emails and official contracts, are signed by Clearview cofounder and CEO Hoan Ton-That and authorize a Clearview trial that ran from December 2018 to March 2019. They show that the New York City Police Department, the largest police department in the country, with about 36,000 officers, has had a close and previously unknown relationship with Clearview that included in-person meetings and customer support from Ton-That. On Monday, an NYPD spokesperson did not answer questions about the emails or the agency\\u2019s interactions with Clearview during the period they were exchanged. They described facial recognition as \\u201Ca limited investigative tool\\u201D that compares a \\u201Cstill image from a surveillance video to a pool of lawfully possessed arrest photos.\\u201D The statement was identical to one that was provided to BuzzFeed News for a previous story. Clearview AI, known for having scraped 3 billion photos without permission from platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, has distributed its software to thousands of police officers around the country, as BuzzFeed News recently detailed in a groundbreaking investigation. But from March 2019 through at least February 2020, officers continued to sign up for Clearview through its free trial program, which gives people an unlimited amount of searches for at least 30 days, unless the company extends it. The emails also reveal that the NYPD tested Clearview on one of its own officers \\u2014 a use of the software that Clearview has explicitly encouraged in the past, asking users to search for their friends. \\u201CTake a selfie with Clearview or search a celebrity to see how powerful the technology can be,\\u201D a January 2020 email from Clearview to an NYPD officer reads. Moreover, the emails show that the NYPD had a much more intimate relationship with Clearview than previously reported. Ton-That, for example, corresponded directly with several NYPD officers throughout the trial period, seeking feedback on the tool. Clearview declined to answer specific questions about its relationship with the NYPD. \\u201CWe have the greatest respect and admiration for the NYPD, which protects those of us who live and work in New York City,\\u201D Ton-That said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. \\u201CWe were honored to provide our service to the NYPD on a trial basis. We are always here to assist should the need arise.\\u201DThe relationship between the NYPD and Clearview appears to have begun in October 2018, when Clearview cofounder Richard Schwartz emailed NYPD Lt. Gregory Besson, whom he had just met. Emails show that Besson connected him with Deputy Inspector Chris Flanagan, who \\u201Ccreates tons of wanted photographs\\u201D on the Financial Crimes Task Force, during the week of Oct. 15. Schwartz told Besson that he was \\u201Cpersonally highly committed to the success of the NYPD,\\u201D since he \\u201Cserved as Mayor Giuliani\\u2019s Senior Advisor and introduced him to Bill Bratton and Jack Maple.\\u201D Days later, Flanagan emailed Ton-That saying some officers were already \\u201Cusing Clearview on a daily basis.\\u201DTon-That soon began corresponding with officers, at times directly reminding them of their login credentials or resetting their passwords via email. On at least one occasion, an NYPD officer sent Ton-That pictures of three individuals who appear to have allegedly committed a crime at an ATM. In December 2018, Flanagan told Ton-That and Schwartz that officers working with the Real Time Crime Center \\u2014 a data hub that pulls from multiple surveillance sources operated by the NYPD \\u2014 were \\u201Cvery impressed with Clearview\\u2019s capabilities.\\u201D But there were also some issues, like being unable to search for mugshots and Clearview\\u2019s lack of a search history. \\u201CWe would also need each search logged with our own case numbers and who conducted the searches to avoid misuse on our end,\\u201D Flanagan said. At some later date, Clearview implemented a search history feature. On Dec. 6, two days after Flanagan\\u2019s email, Clearview signed a nondisclosure agreement with the NYPD and filled out a vendor contract. The vendor contract stipulates that the NYPD is \\u201Conly interested in learning about the products and\\\/or services\\u201D offered by Clearview and does not guarantee an eventual purchase order. The testing period was stated to run from Dec. 6, 2018, to March 6, 2019.During the 2018 to 2019 testing period, officers from the NYPD\\u2019s Financial Crimes Task Force, Grand Larceny Division, Facial Identification Section, and a task force for the Department of Homeland Security focused on crimes against children used Clearview, according to the emails. Ton-That also traded personal messages with several of them. \\u201CHow are the searches going? It\\u2019s fun,\\u201D Ton-That asked Michael King, the deputy inspector of the FBI\\u2019s New York Joint Terrorism Task Force. \\u201CThis application is amazing!! I\\u2019m still testing it,\\u201D King responded.When an officer asked Ton-That if they could register for Clearview with a personal email account, Ton-That obliged. (Typically, officers sign up for Clearview using their work emails.) He gave advice to an NYPD officer who wanted to \\u201Cstreamline\\u201D a search of a \\u201Clarge number of images\\u201D related to an identity theft investigation, explaining that searching for many people can be done \\u201Ceasily and remotely.\\u201D A February 2019 email includes a picture of an NYPD officer taken at a slanted angle, seemingly from a train. \\u201CAs per commissioner Reznick can you please identify the Member of the service in the photos,\\u201D NYPD Detective Alfredo Torres asked King. King promptly forwarded the email to Ton-That. Clearview did not respond to questions about this exchange. On March 6, 2019, the Clearview testing period ended. The emails indicate that the NYPD did not sign a paid contract with Clearview AI after that 90-day period, although several officers appeared to like the tool. In March 2019, detective Michael Furia from the facial recognition unit said he would \\u201Cdo all I can in helping the NYPD take signing on with Clearview as I am a big supporter.\\u201D The following month, when Ton-That asked Sgt. Sara Morris if she had any Clearview \\u201Csuccess stories,\\u201D she said, \\u201Cwe continue to receive positive results that we confirm and [go on] to make arrests.\\u201D Despite not signing a contract, many officers continued to use Clearview AI through at least Feb. 26, 2020, the date of the last of the responsive emails in the document.Although Clearview had supporters within the NYPD, emails show that it did not always return matches for faces searched. A series of emails sent from the Clearview help account to three different NYPD officers appear to show the number of searches the NYPD ran on Clearview each day and the \\u201Chit rate,\\u201D or, presumably, the percentage of those searches that came up with at least one match. Between March 18, 2019, and April 4, 2019, Clearview said the NYPD ran between 15 and 87 searches per day, with an average of 45 searches per day. The hit rate, meanwhile, varied between 32% and 59%, with an average of 48%. Essentially, over 18 days, on average, Clearview got a positive match less than half the time. Through 2019, officers continued to sign up for Clearview. In a \\u201Ctips\\u201D document sent to NYPD officer Michael Rizo in July of that year, the company said that it has \\u201Ca 30-60% match rate,\\u201D which appears to be consistent with the NYPD\\u2019s experience. The email notes that it is \\u201Cadding hundreds of millions of new faces every month and we expect to get to 80% by the end of this year.\\u201D \\u201CIf you get no results for a photo, first try another photo of your suspect, if you have one available,\\u201D the email also says. \\u201CIf you still don\\u2019t get anything, try the same photos again in a week, or two weeks, or in a month. Since we\\u2019re adding millions of new photos a day, you might get a match in a few weeks even if you don\\u2019t right now.\\u201D It\\u2019s unclear what Clearview\\u2019s accuracy and match rates are as of 2021.Officers continued to use Clearview AI through at least Feb. 26, 2020, the date of the last of the responsive emails in the document. It\\u2019s unclear if NYPD officers are still using Clearview. When reached for comment by BuzzFeed News, an NYPD spokesperson declined to answer specific questions. However, the relationship between Clearview and the NYPD appears to have remained friendly through at least February 2020. In January 2020, NYPD officer Damon Gregar sent a copy of his own résumé to Ton-That. \\u201CHi, Hoan! Let me know if you receive this and what you think. Thanks so much,\\u201D Gregar wrote. That same month, officer Emilio Gomez asked Clearview, \\u201Cwhat are the fees to have full access to your software?\\u201D The Clearview help account replied, \\u201C1 billion dollars.\\u201D ● Ryan Mac and Brianna Sacks contributed reporting to this story."},{"author":"Katie Notopoulos","title":"RIP Yahoo Answers","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/katienotopoulos\/rip-yahoo-answers","content":"Yahoo Answers will be shutting down forever, per an announcement on its site, as first reported by the Verge. Questions can be submitted until April 20, and the entire site will be scorched from the face of the internet by May 4, 2021, thus ending the 16-year reign of one of the dumbest places on the internet. What Yahoo Answers lacked in contributions to the pantheon of world knowledge, it made up for in its heroic advances in memeably ridiculous content. BuzzFeed has run lists throughout the years of stupid and silly questions from the site, including, most famously, the question \\u201Chow is babby formed?\\u201D a gem uncovered by Jon Hendren for a blog post for Something Awful. Like any truly stupid thing, Yahoo Answers, which has been owned by Verizon since 2017, was many things rolled into one. It was the Library of Alexandria for earnest seekers of knowledge, like those who sought to learn how girl get pragnent. It was an extremely cunning ploy for SEO traffic, but also a half-baked social platform where users could while away the hours answering questions about social etiquette and advice. Considering that Section 230, legislation that protects platforms like Yahoo and Facebook from being held legally liable for content posted by users, is currently up for debate, Verizon may have looked at the morass of Yahoo Answers and opted to save itself a headache. Yahoo has a long and glorious history of shutting down huge pieces of itself, like a feral fox gnawing off various limbs from a trap in its efforts to maintain relevance and cut costs. In 2009, Yahoo shut down Geocities, one of the biggest repositories of Y2K-era internet culture. Del.icio.us was sold off in 2011, Flickr in 2018. Yahoo Messenger was shut down in 2018. In late 2019, Yahoo Groups was sent to digital Valhalla. Verizon bought AOL in 2015 and Yahoo in 2017, merging them together into a new content company called Oath (no, seriously), along with Tumblr and HuffPost. Tumblr was sold to Automattic, the company that owned WordPress in 2019, and HuffPost was sold to BuzzFeed *checks calendar* about two months ago.\\u201CIt\\u2019s clear that Verizon bought Yahoo and never wanted to be in the user content business. And every move they\\u2019ve been doing has been the most craven corporate, reduced liability, reduced exposure move that they can do,\\u201D Jason Scott of Archive Team, a group that works to preserve old sites, told BuzzFeed News. Archive Team scrambled to make copies of Geocities when it was shut down on short notice back in 2009 (a collection from this curated by artist Olia Lialina called One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age examines old Geocities sites). \\u201CWe\\u2019ve already grabbed Yahoo Answers in the past, we did it 4 years ago. We knew what was going to happen,\\u201D said Scott. \\u201CWe don\\u2019t trust anything that Yahoo owns, period.\\u201DDespite the stupidity, there is certainly valuable information on there that can only be found in those answers that will be lost forever (or existing only in an archive, which is harder to access than through a mere Google search). That a big chunk of internet history is being deleted isn\\u2019t new at this point, and the feeling is so familiar, it doesn\\u2019t seem to sting so much. \\u201CWe don\\u2019t know how much of the internet depends on linking to this, or treating this as firsthand knowledge,\\u201D said Scott. \\u201CWhat we lost is we lose part of our oral history, whether we like it or not.\\u201D"},{"author":"Katie Notopoulos","title":"Slack Is Letting You Cross-Platform Message People Outside Your Work","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/katienotopoulos\/slack-letting-anyone-join-your-workspace","content":"Today, workplace chat company Slack launched a new feature with a goatse-sized privacy loophole: You can add people from outside your company\\u2019s Slack. From there, you can DM them or add them to group DMs or channels inside an existing Slack. As you might have guessed, this did not go smoothly. A few hours after launching, Slack had already canceled a feature that allowed people to tack on a message to their invite emails due to the possibility of harassment. \\u201CSlack Connect\\u2019s security features and robust administrative controls are a core part of its value both for individual users and their organizations,\\u201D Jonathan Prince, a Slack spokesperson, told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CWe made a mistake in this initial roll-out that is inconsistent with our goals for the product and the typical experience of Slack Connect usage.\\u201D Here\\u2019s how it\\u2019s meant to work, in a nice, pleasant world: You\\u2019re a salesperson with Acme Corp, and you want to talk with your client, NiceStore, about their recent order. Both companies use Slack to discuss things internally. So, instead of reaching your client only over email and phone calls (wow, so 20th century), you can now connect over DMs to talk about the latest shipment of Acme widgets. Adding someone to your work Slack isn\\u2019t giving them access to the whole thing, letting them poke around different channels as if they were an employee. Instead, it allows you to do very limited communications \\u2014 DMs, mainly. You need admin-level access to add them to any channels (BuzzFeed\\u2019s admins, who are cowards, refused my requests to add a bunch of former coworkers back into our Slack channel). There are some unpleasant quirks. For example, a friend sent an invite to my buzzfeed.com email to join his workplace Slack. But when I clicked that invite link in my email, it opened a Chrome tab to Slack, which was logged in already \\u2014 with my personal email, connected to personal-use Slacks. I hastily accepted it, inadvertently adding my personal Slack to his professional workplace. In a nice, normal world, that would be the worst part of it. Well, sadly, this isn\\u2019t a nice, normal world. And Slack isn\\u2019t just used by companies with responsible employees and robust admins. The free version of Slack is used for all sorts of things \\u2014 friends chatting, neighborhood mutual aid groups, cabals of assholes and scoundrels, etc.... Every form of dipshit, troll, and harasser exists on a free Slack somewhere. It\\u2019s the internet! Very quickly, Menotti Minutillo, a Twitter employee, noticed that at least one aspect of the change was ripe for abuse. When you invite someone, it sends them an email from a slack.com address, but you can write in whatever message you want \\u2014 a way for someone whom you have blocked on other forms of email or communication to contact you.\\u201CIt feels off to me that Slack released this feature without pressure testing it for abuse and harassment concerns,\\u201D Rachel Tobac, CEO of security firm SocialProof Security, told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CAs users, it\\u2019s not our job to dig into a feature and raise the alarm about a feature that can be used for harassment \\u2014 it\\u2019s great they changed the feature ASAP to close that oversight quickly today, but it\\u2019s essential that all orgs consider and test for harassment and abuse before launching.\\u201D Tobac also pointed out that allowing in extra people to a group Slack heightens the need for a common feature that Slack has never had: a block button."},{"author":"Christopher Miller","title":"Far-Right Militias Are Recruiting On Facebook, Report Finds","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/christopherm51\/far-right-militias-facebook-recruiting-report","content":"When Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faces Congress on Thursday, to testify about extremism online, he will do so as hundreds of far-right militias, including some whose members were charged in the deadly insurrection on the US Capitol, continue to organize, recruit, and promote violence on the platform. More than 200 militia pages and groups were on Facebook as of March 18, according to a new report published Wednesday by the Tech Transparency Project (TTP), a nonprofit watchdog organization, and additional research by BuzzFeed News. Of them, at least 140 included the word \\u201Cmilitia\\u201D in their name. Facebook banned some militant groups and other extremist movements tied to violence last August, after the FBI warned that such groups had become domestic terrorism threats. TPP found that Facebook is automatically creating pages for some of the militias from content that people are sharing, expanding the reach of the groups. This is not a new problem for the site, which in 2019 came under criticism for automatically generating pages for ISIS. In addition, BuzzFeed News and TTP found that the platform was directing people who \\u201Clike\\u201D certain militia pages to check out others, effectively helping these movements recruit and radicalize new members. Many of the groups analyzed by BuzzFeed News and TTP shared images of guns and violence. Some posted anti-government messages in support of the mob inspired by former President Donald Trump that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6. Others shared misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic and racist memes targeting Black Lives Matter activists. \\u201CAfter nearly a year of promises to curb the organizing of militia groups on the platform \\u2014 a threat that culminated in the attack on the Capitol January 6 \\u2014 Facebook has shown that they are not capable of handling the dangers posed by their platform despite their claims to Congress and the public,\\u201D TTP director Katie Paul told BuzzFeed News. A Facebook spokesperson told BuzzFeed News: \\\"We'll review the accuracy of the claims and the content referenced as soon as we have access to this report. We have banned over 890 militarized social movements and removed more than 3,400 Pages, 19,500 groups, 120 events, 25,300 Facebook profiles and 7500 Instagram accounts representing them; but simply using the word 'militia' does not violate our policies.\\\"The findings come as the Biden administration moves to crack down on domestic violent extremism. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a report this month that identified \\u201Cmilitia violent extremists\\u201D as being among the \\u201Cmost lethal\\u201D public safety threats. The US Attorney\\u2019s office has charged more than 300 people with participating in the insurrection, and the government has said it expects to bring cases against at least 100 more. Zuckerberg is also set to give his first testimony before Congress since the events of Jan. 6. Along with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Zuckerberg will be questioned by House lawmakers about social media\\u2019s role in promoting extremism and misinformation. Facebook\\u2019s ongoing struggles with militia content on its platform paint a troubling backdrop for the hearing. As both BuzzFeed News and TTP reported in January, Facebook allowed far-right domestic extremists to openly discuss weapons and tactics, coordinate activities, and spread calls to overthrow the government for months ahead of the Capitol attack. The new reporting by BuzzFeed News and TTP shows that Facebook\\u2019s problems with militia activity persist despite the company vowing in August 2020 to take action against them and other extremist groups that pose risks to public safety. More than 20 of the militia groups mentioned in TTP\\u2019s report were created after Facebook\\u2019s initial crackdown. Some of them were formed in December 2020 or later, as the pro-Trump Stop the Steal movement was gaining steam. One group, the Texas Militia, launched its page on the afternoon of Jan. 6, as the attack on the Capitol was under way. The creator and administrator of the group warned at the time that \\u201Cmodern technology has enabled radicals to subvert the process by which we elect our representatives.\\u201D \\u201CWe must be prepared\\u2026to defend our rights and prevent [the] takeover of our great nation by radicals, uphold the Constitution, and preserve our way of life,\\u201D he added. TTP found that in recent weeks, some of the militia groups have circulated propaganda posts for the Proud Boys, which Facebook has banned since 2018. One of the posts came from C.A.M.P., which stands for Constitutional American Militia Project. On March 13, the group\\u2019s administrator posted a three-minute highlight reel of Proud Boys attacks on Black Lives Matter protesters as well as footage from the Capitol riot. At least 19 leaders, members, or associates of the Proud Boys have been charged in federal court with conspiracy and other offenses related to the Jan. 6 attack. On Tuesday, two Proud Boys, Joe Biggs and Ethan Nordean, pleaded not guilty to federal charges accusing them of helping to plan and lead the insurrection. The militia pages not only persist on Facebook, but the platform is actually pushing people toward them, TTP and BuzzFeed News found. In doing so, Facebook is expanding the reach of the movements and \\u201Chelping these organizations potentially recruit and radicalize users,\\u201D TPP\\u2019s report stated. For instance, when BuzzFeed News visited the East Kentucky Malitia (the misspelling appears deliberate; groups and pages often alter spellings of their names to avoid detection), it was suggested to visit the pages of Fairfax County Militia and the KY Mountain Rangers. The Mountain Rangers page then led to the Texas Freedom Force, an outfit that federal authorities investigating the Jan. 6 attack have called a \\u201Cmilitia extremist group.\\u201D One of its members, Guy Reffitt, has been charged for participating in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.Reffitt, 48, of Wylie, Texas, pleaded not guilty last week to three charges of obstructing an official proceeding, trespassing, and witness tampering. According to prosecutors, Reffitt\\u2019s wife shared with authorities that he also belongs to the Three Percenters, an anti-government extremist faction of the militia movement, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Several Three Percenters have been charged alongside Reffitt for participating in the Capitol attack. Many pages for the group were found by TTP and BuzzFeed News to still be active on Facebook. Members of these groups are also using Facebook to organize events, despite revelations that Facebook failed to act on a Kenosha Guard event page that urged people to bring firearms to a Black Lives Matter protest which resulted in two people being fatally shot. Four people are suing Facebook for its alleged role in enabling the violence that overtook the city of Kenosha. One such group, the DFW Beacon Unit in Dallas\\u2013Fort Worth, Texas, which describes itself as a \\u201Clegitimate militia,\\u201D posted on Monday about holding a training session. Some of the pages suggest efforts to coordinate with law enforcement. One page called \\u201CCarter County Oklahoma Militia\\u201D posted on Jan. 5 that it had changed its name after speaking with the local sheriff. It said the sheriff is looking for \\u201Creserve deputies\\u201D and that people interested in being a reservist should contact the page manager."},{"author":"Ryan Mac","title":"Facebook Is Building An Instagram For Kids","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/ryanmac\/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13","content":"Executives at Instagram are planning to build a version of the popular photo-sharing app that can be used by children under the age of 13, according to an internal company post obtained by BuzzFeed News. \\u201CI\\u2019m excited to announce that going forward, we have identified youth work as a priority for Instagram and have added it to our H1 priority list,\\u201D Vishal Shah, Instagram\\u2019s vice president of product, wrote on an employee message board on Thursday. \\u201CWe will be building a new youth pillar within the Community Product Group to focus on two things: (a) accelerating our integrity and privacy work to ensure the safest possible experience for teens and (b) building a version of Instagram that allows people under the age of 13 to safely use Instagram for the first time.\\u201D Current Instagram policy forbids children under the age of 13 from using the service. According to the post, the work would be overseen by Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, and led by Pavni Diwanji, a vice president who joined parent company Facebook in December. Previously, Diwanji worked at Google, where she oversaw the search giant\\u2019s children-focused products, including YouTube Kids.The internal announcement comes two days after Instagram said it needs to do more to protect its youngest users. Following coverage and public criticism of the abuse, bullying, or predation faced by teens on the app, the company published a blog post on Tuesday titled \\u201CContinuing to Make Instagram Safer for the Youngest Members of Our Community.\\u201D That post makes no mention of Instagram\\u2019s intent to build a product for children under the age of 13, but states, \\u201CWe require everyone to be at least 13 to use Instagram and have asked new users to provide their age when they sign up for an account for some time.\\u201D The announcement lays the groundwork for how Facebook \\u2014 whose family of products is used by 3.3 billion people every month \\u2014 plans to expand its user base. While various laws limit how companies can build products for and target children, Instagram clearly sees kids under 13 as a viable growth segment, particularly because of the app\\u2019s popularity among teens.In a short interview, Mosseri told BuzzFeed News that the company knows that \\u201Cmore and more kids\\u201D want to use apps like Instagram and that it was a challenge verifying their age, given most people don\\u2019t get identification documents until they are in their mid-to-late teens. \\u201CWe have to do a lot here,\\u201D he said, \\u201Cbut part of the solution is to create a version of Instagram for young people or kids where parents have transparency or control. It\\u2019s one of the things we\\u2019re exploring.\\u201D Mosseri added that it was early in Instagram\\u2019s development of the product and that the company doesn\\u2019t yet have a \\u201Cdetailed plan.\\u201D Priya Kumar, a PhD candidate at the University of Maryland who researches how social media affects families, said a version of Instagram for children is a way for Facebook to hook in young people and normalize the idea \\u201Cthat social connections exist to be monetized.\\u201D \\u201CFrom a privacy perspective, you're just legitimizing children\\u2019s interactions being monetized in the same way that all of the adults using these platforms are,\\u201D she said. Kumar said children who use YouTube Kids often migrate to the main YouTube platform, which is a boon for the company and concerning for parents. \\u201CA lot of children, either by choice or by accident, migrate onto the broader YouTube platform,\\u201D she said. \\u201CJust because you have a platform for kids, it doesn\\u2019t mean the kids are going to stay there.\\u201D The development of an Instagram product for kids follows the 2017 launch of Messenger Kids, a Facebook product aimed at children between the ages of 6 and 12. After the product\\u2019s launch, a group of more than 95 advocates for children\\u2019s health sent a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, calling for him to discontinue the product and citing research that \\u201Cexcessive use of digital devices and social media is harmful to children and teens, making it very likely this new app will undermine children\\u2019s healthy development.\\u201DFacebook said it had consulted an array of experts in developing Messenger Kids. Wired later revealed that the company had a financial relationship with most of the people and organizations that had advised on the product. In 2019, the Verge reported that a bug in Messenger Kids allowed children to join groups with strangers, despite Facebook\\u2019s claims that the product had strict privacy controls. The error meant that \\u201Cthousands of children were left in chats with unauthorized users, a violation of the core promise of Messenger Kids,\\u201D according to the Verge. Facebook said the bug had only affected a \\u201Csmall number of group chats.\\u201D Instagram users already face issues with bullying and harassment. A 2017 survey by Ditch the Label, an anti-bullying nonprofit, found that 42% of people between the ages of 12 and 20 had experienced cyberbullying on Instagram, the highest percentage of any platform measured. Roughly two years later, Instagram announced features aimed at combating bullying. \\u201CTeenagers have always been cruel to one another. But Instagram provides a uniquely powerful set of tools to do so,\\u201D reported the Atlantic. \\\"What we aspire to do \\u2014 and this will take years, I want to be clear \\u2014 is to lead the fight against online bullying,\\\" Mosseri said at a Facebook event in 2019. That year, the National Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children in the UK reported that it had found a \\u201C200% rise in recorded instances in the use of Instagram to target and abuse children.\\\" The targeting and grooming of young children by older men on Instagram was the also focus of a story published on Medium titled \\u201CI\\u2019m a 37-Year-Old Mom & I Spent Seven Days Online as an 11-Year-Old Girl.\\u201D The moves Instagram announced earlier this week are intended to curb such abuse. The company said it would limit messages between teens and adults they don\\u2019t follow and \\u201Cmake it more difficult\\u201D for adults to find and follow teens. \\u201CThis may include things like restricting these adults from seeing teen accounts in 'Suggested Users', preventing them from discovering teen content in Reels or Explore, and automatically hiding their comments on public posts by teens,\\u201D the company\\u2019s post reads. While Instagram is trying to make itself safe for teens, it\\u2019s unclear how its executives believe it can make its platform safe to children under the age of 13. Instagram head Mosseri, who has previously faced safety issues at home, covers the faces of his young children with emojis when posting images of them to his public account. \\u201CInteresting you blurred your kids faces while millions of moms\\\/dads are posting their kids faces on your platform,\\u201D one follower wrote on a photo Mosseri posted on Halloween last year. \\u201CWhat do you know that they don\\u2019t about how these images are used? Mosseri told BuzzFeed News that because he was a public figure, security concerns had led him to hide his children\\u2019s faces in those images. However, he still maintains private Instagram accounts for each of his own children to share their upbringings with his family members and friends around the world. \\u201CI think sharing sensitive information is important to be careful about,\\u201D he said."},{"author":"Katie Notopoulos","title":"Facebook Is Working On A Wearable AR Wrist Device","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/katienotopoulos\/facebook-wrist-device","content":"Facebook is working on a new neural wristband that can read the electrical signals sent to your hands and send them to an augmented reality interface. Essentially, it's a bracelet that lets you type without a keyboard (potentially without even moving your fingers) or control something on soon-to-be-released AR glasses. It seems as if Facebook, after years of harvesting data on your marketing possibilities, is finally starting to be able to read your mind? \\u201CI cannot emphasize this enough: This cannot read your brain,\\u201D Andrew \\u201CBoz\\u201D Bosworth, VP of Facebook Reality Labs, the team responsible for AR and VR (and Portal), told BuzzFeed News. He compared the wrist device to a computer keyboard: A keyboard doesn\\u2019t read your thoughts, but it takes your motor inputs you make and turns them into expressions. In 2019, Facebook acquired CTRL-labs, a neural interface startup that had been working on this kind of wearable device for several years. The wearable wrist device has the potential to complement augmented reality glasses and other VR technology Facebook has been working on. Facebook is working on AR glasses, and in a presentation to the press this week, it showed a few examples of how the wrist device might work with the glasses. It could act as a virtual assistant in cooking, for example: As you make a recipe, the AR glasses show a menu with a \\u201Cyes\\\/no\\u201D option to set a timer. You\\u2019d make a tiny pinching gesture \\u2014 an \\u201Cintelligent click\\u201D \\u2014 to start the timer or do other commands. The examples Facebook gave are all things that are somewhat familiar to anyone who uses a voice assistant or smartwatch \\u2014 things like starting a music playlist easily or placing an order online at a coffee shop. But instead of going to the hassles of opening an app on your phone or yelling \\u201Chey Siri,\\u201D you merely waggle your index finger.But compared to faster coffee orders, there is a very life-changing use for this technology: For people with mobility and sensory limitations, this could be a huge accessibility aid. Facebook showed a demonstration of a person who was born without several fingers on one hand using the device to move a computer 3D model of a full hand moving and grasping. However, neuroprosthetics for people with missing limbs or limited mobility have been around for a while, created by researchers focused solely on medical uses.Another of the most tantalizing use of this technology is in lieu of an actual keyboard to type \\u2014 completely eliminating the possibility of typos from accidentally hit keys. Facebook's track record has given people good reason to be skeptical of a device like this. If you\\u2019re reading this article and thinking \\u201Cyikes,\\u201D but would think \\u201Cwhoa cool\\u201D about one made by Apple, you\\u2019re not alone. BuzzFeed News reported in February that Bosworth had spoken at a companywide meeting about the possibility of facial recognition built into AR glasses and what legal implications it might have. \\u201CI don\\u2019t want to be the one to decide how society should handle facial recognition,\\u201D Bosworth told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CI would like society to have that robust debate and settle on acceptable social norms, and then I\\u2019ll work with that.\\u201D Bosworth is aware of the trust issue. \\u201CYou have these conversations up in the public. Building trust is not the hardest thing in the world. It just takes time. You have to set expectations and meet those expectations consistently over time. Trust arrives on foot but leaves on horseback.\\u201D"},{"author":"Craig Silverman","title":"Conspiracy Theory Books About COVID Are All Over Amazon","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/craigsilverman\/amazon-covid-conspiracy-books","content":"Conspiracy theorist David Icke\\u2019s lies about COVID-19 caused Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Spotify to ban him. But on Amazon, Icke, who believes in the existence of lizard people, is recommended reading. Despite being filled with misinformation about the pandemic, Icke\\u2019s book The Answer at one point ranked 30th on Amazon.com\\u2019s bestseller list for Communication & Media Studies. Its popularity is partly thanks to the e-commerce giant\\u2019s powerful recommendation algorithms that suggest The Answer and other COVID conspiracy theory books to people searching for basic information about the coronavirus, according to new research shared exclusively with BuzzFeed News.\\u201CAmazon is doing the least, by a substantial measure, of any of the major platforms to deal with the misinformation and conspiracy theories around the COVID-19 virus,\\u201D Marc Tuters, an assistant professor of new media and digital culture at the University of Amsterdam, told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CFor creators and consumers of conspiracies, Amazon.com is a one-stop shop,\\u201D said Tuters, who co-led the team that included researchers and students at King\\u2019s College London, the University of Amsterdam, and the Digital Methods Initiative Winter School, in association with the infodemic.eu project. The problem highlights how Amazon\\u2019s search and book promotion mechanisms often direct customers to COVID-19 conspiracy titles. Tuters does not advocate for banning the books but says Amazon needs to follow the lead of other platforms and elevate reliable information about COVID-19. For roughly a year, Facebook, Google, Pinterest, and Twitter have placed authoritative information about COVID-19 and vaccines at the top of results pages when people search for information about the pandemic, and removed coronavirus misinformation from their platforms and their recommendation systems. This stands in stark contrast to Amazon, where researchers found that COVID conspiracy books have appeared on the first page of search results for basic terms like \\u201Ccovid,\\u201D \\u201Ccovid-19,\\u201D and \\u201Cvaccine.\\u201D Amazon also recommended conspiracy books when the researchers browsed non-conspiratorial books about the virus and related topics. An Amazon spokesperson said that beginning in February 2020, the company placed a banner with a link to resources about COVID-19 when people search for terms related to the pandemic. It began doing the same for vaccines this January. \\u201CWe\\u2019ve added links to these sites (ex. the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization) at the top of the search result pages if a customer searches for books related to vaccines or the coronavirus,\\u201D they said. But this feature is not consistent across Amazon\\u2019s international stores. Of its English-language stores, Amazon Canada and Singapore did not display government resources when searching for \\u201Ccovid\\u201D or \\u201Cvaccine.\\u201D The company\\u2019s store in the United Arab Emirates showed them when searching for \\u201Ccovid\\u201D but not for \\u201Cvaccine.\\u201D Unlike other platforms, Amazon has not taken steps to remove COVID-19 misinformation entirely, or at least from its recommendation systems. Amazon\\u2019s approach means it\\u2019s profiting from sales of the conspiracy theory books, said evelyn douek, a lecturer at Harvard Law School who studies global regulation of online speech. \\\"There's a strong argument that if you're making money off it, you should take more responsibility,\\\" said douek. Amazon's content guidelines for books reserve the right to remove any \\u201Cmaterial we deem inappropriate or offensive.\\u201D Although it has taken action against some books, the company is rarely transparent about why. In January, it removed books and other merchandise promoting the QAnon mass delusion, and removed the white supremacist novel The Turner Diaries. Last Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the retailer sent a letter to US senators explaining that it recently decided to stop selling books that link LGBTQ identities to mental illness. It did not say how or why it came to that decision. The Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on the company\\u2019s reasons for removing books. \\u201CWe invest significant time and resources to enforce these guidelines, using a combination of machine learning, automation, and dedicated teams of human reviewers,\\u201D they said. The prevalence of COVID conspiracy books suggests it\\u2019s far behind other platforms, according to Claire Wardle, cofounder and director of First Draft, a nonprofit organization that researches misinformation. \\u201CWhether it's people like David Icke or others, Amazon should have similar types of policies around misinformation\\u201D as other platforms, Wardle told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CI don't necessarily want them to be banned, but they should be taken out of the recommendation algorithms.\\u201D Amazon\\u2019s approach appears to be haphazard and driven by public pressure, which douek said can do more harm than good. \\u201CThat's a really spectacularly bad way of dealing with that,\\u201D she said. \\u201CLike, we don't want it to be truly on the base of what they think is controversial or attracts attention. We want there to be clearer standards, that are upfront and that Amazon's tying itself to, not just responding to public pressure.\\u201DTuters\\u2019 team identified 20 COVID conspiracy titles, excluding \\u201CCOVID skeptic\\u201D books that expressed doubts about the origins or nature of the virus, which they tracked across Amazon\\u2019s 19 international stores. They found that Amazon\\u2019s algorithms and user reviews helped those fringe books thrive. Tuters said Amazon is \\u201Cdirecting browsers and buyers, speedily and smoothly, down the conspiratorial rabbit hole.\\u201D Along with Icke\\u2019s The Answer, those books include Number Games: 9\\\/11 to Coronavirus, which argues the pandemic is part of a conspiracy revealed by a numeric code; a book that says COVID-19 \\u201Cspawned from the minds of evil men who seek to depopulate our planet Earth and pursue unlimited control\\u201D; and Corona 911: The Dark Weapons Backchannel to Pakistan and China From the US Congress, which claims the coronavirus is a biological weapon with connections to US intelligence programs. They found that the most-recommended book was COVID Operation: What Happened, Why It Happened, and What's Next. Coauthored by Pamela Popper, a naturopath, it claims COVID-19 is a \\u201Choax\\u201D perpetrated \\u201Cby a wide network of enemies of the people who have managed to disguise themselves as public servants, health professionals, and founders and heads of global non-profits.\\u201D When BuzzFeed News viewed the book on Amazon.com, the site recommended purchasing COVID Operation together with a book titled Anyone Who Tells You Vaccines Are Safe and Effective Is Lying. Although the company spokesperson said book recommendations are based on customer behavior, Tuters argued Amazon should prevent its algorithm from recommending conspiracy books to customers. \\u201CI understand why people are scared or squeamish about censoring books,\\u201D he said. \\u201CYou could change the way the recommendations work. You could demote [the books] or you could even sever them from the recommendations altogether.\\u201D Aside from algorithmic promotion, the research also revealed a pipeline from YouTube to COVID conspiracy books, which people repeatedly mentioned purchasing after learning about them on YouTube. \\u201CThe review space functions as a kind of social media in its own right and people organize in these review spaces \\u2014 they're in dialogue with one another,\\u201D Tuters said. This is similar to the problem YouTube has, douek said. The video platform has worked to stop recommending harmful or conspiracy theory-focused videos, but viewers still find them on other social media.\\u201CIt's like the human centipede of misinformation,\\u201D she said. The problems affected more than just books written by conspiracy theorists. People have taught the recommendation system to treat The Great Reset, a book coauthored by the head of the World Economic Forum, as if it were filled with conspiracy theories. The book advocates for economic and social action \\u201Cto create a more inclusive, resilient and sustainable world\\u201D after the pandemic. Conspiracy theorists have fixated on the book, arguing that it\\u2019s proof of the global elite\\u2019s nefarious plan to use COVID-19 to control the world. Based on its reviews and related book suggestions, people browsing the book\\u2019s page on Amazon\\u2019s sites could come away thinking that\\u2019s its actual message. \\u201CIt's not a conspiracy theory book, but it is kind of valorized by Amazon's algorithm as a conspiracy theory book,\\u201D Tuters said. \\u201COne of the first times I encountered that book, [Amazon] tried to bundle it with an explicitly conspiracy theory book for me to purchase.\\u201D Wardle said customer reviews are a uniquely important signal of credibility on a site like Amazon. \\u201CThere's something distinct here about Amazon and purchasing, how it's the same look and feel of the thing that we use to decide which Instant Pot to buy,\\u201D she said. ●"},{"author":"Ryan Mac","title":"Facebook Made Playbook To Respond To Polarization Accusations","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/ryanmac\/facebook-execs-polarization-playbook","content":"Facebook has created a \\u201Dplaybook\\u201D to help its employees rebut criticism that the company\\u2019s products fuel political polarization and social division. The document, which cites a range of academic studies but does not include recent data from the company\\u2019s own research teams, was posted to Facebook's internal Workplace discussion forum by Chief Product Officer Chris Cox and Pratiti Raychoudhury, vice president of research, earlier this week. During a Thursday webinar for employees, Cox said the document would \\u201Cequip all of you to go home and have dinner\\u201D with friends and family and explain why public perceptions of Facebook are wrong. In the paper, titled \\u201CWhat We Know About Polarization,\\u201D Cox and Raychodhury call polarization \\u201Can albatross public narrative for the company.\\u201D \\u201CThe implicit argument is that Facebook is contributing to a social problem of driving societies into contexts where they can\\u2019t trust each other, can\\u2019t share common ground, can\\u2019t have conversation about issues, and can\\u2019t share a common view on reality,\\u201D they write, adding that \\u201Cthe media narrative in this case is generally not supported by the research.\\u201D While denying that Facebook meaningfully contributes to polarization, Pablo Barberá, a research scientist at the company, also suggested political polarization could be a good thing during Thursday\\u2019s presentation. \\u201CIf we look back at history, a lot of the major social movements and major transformations, for example, the extension of civil rights or voting rights in this country have been the result of increasing polarization,\\u201D he told employees.The paper and accompanying webinar are an indication of how Facebook will publicly address the perception that it is harmful to society, an issue that has become increasingly urgent in the aftermath of a divisive presidential election and attempted coup exacerbated by the misinformation and hate speech that had proliferated on the platform. The presentation came more than two months after rioters \\u2014 many of them stoked by misinformation on the social network about Joe Biden\\u2019s presidential win \\u2014 stormed the US Capitol, and after various employees left Facebook in frustration, claiming it is not doing enough to address hate and extremism on its platform. Notably, the paper does not address internal data created or cited by departing employees that shows how divisive political content on the platform can radicalize people and degrade the overall Facebook user experience. When shown the internal document by BuzzFeed News, one former Facebook employee who studied polarization at the company said, \\u201CThis memo is corporate gaslighting disguised as a research brief.\\u201D They left the company last year and asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. \\u201CIt suggests that because other factors have contributed to increased polarization, Facebook itself is somehow less likely to have contributed to the problem,\\u201D they said. \\u201CIt also ignores a large body of reporting and research \\u2014 including research conducted by internal Facebook teams \\u2014 which demonstrates the polarizing effects of Facebook\\u2019s products, including (and perhaps especially) Facebook Groups.\\u201D In response, Facebook spokesperson Liz Bourgeois said in a statement that \\u201Cbetter understanding and combating polarization is a focus of a number of teams across Facebook.\\u201D She added, \\u201CGiven much of the peer-reviewed research about polarization counters the views of our critics, it\\u2019s unsurprising that yesterday\\u2019s event is being mischaracterized to suggest we don\\u2019t acknowledge the role we have to play in its causes and solutions.\\u201D Daniel Kreiss, a principal researcher of the Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, described Facebook's paper as \\\"generally in line with the state of the research literature.\\\" But he offered this caveat: \\\"With Facebook, it's never just research. It's research that's running alongside the interests of a multiple-billion-dollar entity.\\\" He said the research cited in the company's paper does not refute the idea that Facebook contributes to polarization. \\\"I would say that it doesn't seem like Facebook gets entirely off the hook,\\\" Kreiss told BuzzFeed News. Cox\\u2019s Thursday presentation follows a series of high-profile departures from Facebook\\u2019s civic integrity team, which was tasked with protecting users. As BuzzFeed News has reported, a number of those employees torched the company in their internal departure notes for failing to take stronger action against hate and misinformation. \\u201CWe\\u2019ve known for over a year now that our recommendation systems can very quickly lead users down the path to conspiracy theories and groups,\\u201D a departing employee wrote last August about the QAnon mass delusion. \\u201CIn the meantime, the fringe group\\\/set of beliefs has grown to national prominence with QAnon congressional candidates and QAnon hashtags and groups trending in the mainstream. We were willing to act only *after* things had spiraled into a dire state.\\u201D Facebook\\u2019s polarization playbook makes no mention of that employee\\u2019s findings \\u2014 or any internal data collected by the social giant\\u2019s large research teams. During the presentation, Barberá attributed polarization in the US over the last four decades to increasing inequality and racial divisions, growing disagreements among politicians, and partisan news outlets on TV and the internet. He also noted that some countries with Facebook were much different from the US in that they had experienced less polarization. \\u201CThere\\u2019s not a lot of clear evidence here,\\u201D he said. Cox contrasted the fragmented media environments of the US, one of the most polarized countries by Facebook\\u2019s research, with places like the Philippines and Myanmar, where he said the \\u201Cinternet is incredibly important\\u201D in presenting views outside of state-controlled media. (Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte relied on Facebook misinformation campaigns to win an election, while the United Nations found that the site\\u2019s spread of hate speech abetted genocide against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.) \\u201CThe growing body of research on this issue suggests that social media cannot be clearly identified in social science research as a root cause of polarization, but we have lots more work to do to understand its effects (and what we should do about it),\\u201D said the Facebook paper. Key to Facebook\\u2019s arguments is the idea that not all polarization is inherently bad. The company\\u2019s paper presented two types of polarization: issue polarization (divergence over a singular topic) and the more harmful, affective polarization (in which one group rejects another because of differences in politics, religion, ethnicity, or class).\\u201CIssue polarization is not necessarily bad,\\u201D Barberá said during the presentation, noting that it can lead to political action. \\u201CWhen things get intense politically, that also gets people engaged in the political process. Like, when you see that the parties are presenting different platforms, you'll get more interested because your vote can make a difference.\\u201D But as Kreiss observed, there is a troubling counterpoint here. \\\"One thing social media platforms absolutely do is make it easier to have a global white supremacist movement than it was 30 or 40 years ago.\\\" Cox spoke highly of the community-building potential of Facebook Groups, which the company sees as the future of interaction on the platform. Despite the fact that the social network stopped recommending political groups just before the election based on findings that they contributed to misinformation, the Facebook CPO commended the ability of Boy Scouts, parent\\u2013teacher associations, or dog walking groups to contribute to a shared \\u201Csocial fabric.\\u201D \\u201COn Groups, we believe that groups are on balance a positive, depolarizing force,\\u201D Cox said. He mentioned neither the supposedly banned right-wing extremist groups that persisted on the platform in the weeks leading up to the November election nor the \\u201CStop the Steal\\u201D groups that flourished while trafficking in the lie that the vote had been rigged against Donald Trump. When the webinar was opened up to questions from employees, one asked whether Facebook was like a tobacco company funding research to show its products were not a problem.In response, Facebook\\u2019s leaders argued that most of the research presented in its internal document was not funded by the company. BuzzFeed News found that at least two of the 13 papers and other writings presented in the memo to employees were done in collaboration with Facebook. The paper\\u2019s conclusion also cites David Brooks, a prominent New York Times columnist who has written for Facebook\\u2019s corporate site and whose nonprofit project was funded by the company. Despite dismissing the idea that Facebook contributes to negative polarization, company executives did acknowledge the need for change on the platform. Building on comments made by CEO Mark Zuckerberg during a January earnings call about halting recommendations for certain political content on people\\u2019s News Feeds, Cox said the company is evaluating \\u201Chow people feel about the amount of divisive content in their News Feed.\\u201D John Hegeman, the vice president of News Feed, said the company would be \\u201Crebalancing the amount of political content in feed\\u201D and \\u201Cdemote posts that can result in kind of nonconstructive angry reactions.\\u201D Raychoudhury, the company\\u2019s vice president of research, echoed that sentiment. Even if executives didn\\u2019t think Facebook contributed to polarization, she said, it is developing metrics to understand whether its services \\u201Chelp people to build empathy and trust with one another.\\u201D \\u201CAffective polarization is actually counter to our company's mission,\\u201D she said. \\u201CIt will be harder to bring the world closer together if groups of people hate each other.\\u201D"},{"author":"Paul McLeod","title":"Democrats And Republicans Are Coming After Big Tech","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/paulmcleod\/congress-big-tech-monopolies-antitrust","content":"WASHINGTON \\u2014 There's a growing bipartisan appetite in Congress to crack down on big tech, with progressive Democrats and conservative Republicans preparing to flex the federal government's anti-monopoly powers. The Senate began hearings this week on antitrust law. Senators expressed different philosophies and concerns, but they all agreed on at least one key point: Tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have become too powerful. It's the latest sign that Congress is ready to jump into a decadeslong vacuum created by marginal action from federal regulators as the tech sector became increasingly concentrated. Lawmakers discussed ways both to stop tech giants from growing larger in the future and steps that could be taken to chip away at their existing dominance. \\u201CWhy should any dominant corporation be able to merge with any other entity?\\u201D Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican, said in a Thursday hearing after rattling off a long list of companies owned by Google. \\u201CWhy should Google, for instance, or Facebook be able to buy anything else given their dominant size?\\u201D Sen. Marsha Blackburn, also a Republican, blasted tech giants for cornering the online ad market while local newsrooms endure round after round of cuts. Three companies \\u2014 Google, Facebook, and Amazon \\u2014 take in about two-thirds of all online advertising dollars. \\u201CEvery one of these newsrooms have experienced the loss of reporters, which is the loss of journalism, which is the loss of insight of the people into issues,\\u201D said Blackburn. But politicians still don\\u2019t agree about exactly what should be done. The Senate Antitrust subcommittee\\u2019s new Democratic chair, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, is sponsoring legislation to beef up government antitrust enforcement, tighten rules on which mergers are permissible, and force merging parties to prove their merger would not violate the law, among other measures. She\\u2019s trying to get bipartisan support for that and other reforms, which could include Australia-style requirements on tech giants to pay media outlets for producing news. Republicans are leery. Sen. Mike Lee, the Republican ranking member on the Antitrust subcommittee, said at the beginning of the hearing he opposed government intervention and a \\u201Csweeping transformation\\u201D of antitrust laws. But before long he, too, was talking about the need to curtail big tech companies. Lee outlined his concerns about what happened to Parler, a social media platform favored by conservatives that was removed from the Apple app store and briefly taken offline altogether. Lee questioned whether it\\u2019s even possible for upstart competitors to challenge platforms like Facebook and Twitter in the current environment. \\u201C\\u2018Build your own\\u2019 sounds really nice in theory, but in this instance, I\\u2019m not sure it works in practice. Do we have an entry problem?\\u201D he asked. One recurring theme from witnesses during the hearing was the once-robust enforcement of antitrust legislation that dramatically broke up rail and telecom monopolies, had fallen into disuse in modern times. At one point, Open Markets Institute Executive Director Barry Lynn argued that Amazon should be barred from both running a marketplace and selling products on that marketplace \\u2014 competing against other sellers all while being able to use their sales information against them. \\u201CThere should never be competition between the provider of services and the customer of those services,\\u201D said Lynn. \\u201CIt\\u2019s a conflict of interest. Traditionally we have always prohibited this \\u2014 we can trace it back in US federal law to baking policy in the 1860s. There\\u2019s nothing new here, what\\u2019s new is that we haven\\u2019t applied these kinds of rules to these corporations today.\\u201D The political movement toward cracking down on tech companies is anything but an organized coalition. Many Republicans have accused social media platforms of discriminating against conservative voices. Democrats have mostly rolled their eyes at this and argued that the real problem is a lack of moderation allowing disinformation and hate speech to flourish. Klobuchar told BuzzFeed News before the hearing that she believes there is enough common ground to craft reforms that could get enough bipartisan support to pass a narrowly split Congress. \\u201CThis is exactly what was going on in the Gilded Age,\\u201D she said, drawing a comparison from small companies trying to compete with the likes of Amazon to local farmers trying to negotiate with rail monopolies a century ago. She closed the meeting Thursday by saying the subcommittee will hold more hearings on how to curtail monopoly power. \\u201CIt feels like every century we take on laws in this way,\\u201D said Klobuchar. \\u201CAnd this is our moment.\\u201D"},{"author":"Scaachi Koul","title":"Our Technological Dystopian Future Is Here, And I Hate It","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/scaachikoul\/year-of-covid-digital-future-fail","content":"In junior high, I had a friend who never wanted to hang out, but she was perfectly fine just talking for six or seven hours straight on MSN Messenger.

It\\u2019s a strange anniversary, and I\\u2019m not entirely sure how we should commemorate the agonizing loss and terror that are still very much going on. What insights can we glean from a year of this when we all have, probably, another fucking year of this \\u2014 a digital-first (and sometimes digital-only) world, an unsatisfying avatar of the real thing. There hasn\\u2019t even been room yet to be nostalgic for the online alternatives we started using during the pandemic, largely because we still have to use them. The vaccine is steadily being rolled out but travel remains restricted, and social distancing will continue to be the norm for the immediate future, so we\\u2019ll have to keep it going with the virtual happy hours, the online book launches, and the remote cooking classes where I pretend to give one iota of a shit about baking bread. I\\u2019m done with living my life entirely through a laptop, and yet it\\u2019s not done with me. A pandemic year spent increasingly online feels like the natural progression of the society we were hurtling toward, one we have designed for decades. We made phones that were tiny computers, which connected us, immediately, anywhere, with the 10th-grade English teacher we added on Facebook after we graduated. We signed up for social media accounts so we could send a DM to any writer we like \\u2014 or, more accurately, hate \\u2014 and tell them where they were wrong in their stupid little article. (Please do not do this after you read my stupid little article, I am very tired.) Our news is almost completely digitized, meaning our every waking moment can be spent looking at up-to-the-minute charts about who\\u2019s dying, where, and how. FaceTime, Zoom, Signal, iMessage, Google Hangouts, Skype, Facebook Portal \\u2014 they\\u2019ve all made it possible for us to never feel too far from anyone we love. There is Netflix\\u2019s Teleparty if you want to, awkwardly, watch a movie with a buddy. You can send your friend a string of voice memos every day for a kind of stream-of-consciousness communication; you\\u2019ll never feel like you\\u2019re out of touch, but you\\u2019ll never feel intimately connected either. Miss someone\\u2019s face? The way they tilt their head when you tell them a story? The look of your mother\\u2019s hands in red nail polish? Call your person, and their countenance can be projected onto any screen you prefer. We were sold on it as an approximation for physical contact, so close to the real thing that you won\\u2019t even miss the real thing.All that technological advancement, all those emotional arguments for a tech-centric world \\u2014 it was all made for a moment like this. And a year into it, I feel like I can definitively say that it fucking sucks. Good god, how it sucks. I would rather swallow all my teeth than do one more video call with friends whose faces I just want to poke with my grubby fingers. I would rather my body stiffen into an unusable husk than do one more stretching session with an instructor over a video call who mispronounces my name throughout Savasana, which really should be illegal to do to me, an actual Indian person. I love the internet; I built my career, my social life, and my personal life on it for 15 years. And now I would rather do anything else. Psychologists call it \\u201Ctouch deprivation\\u201D or \\u201Cskin hunger,\\u201D the emotional and physical need for touch \\u2014 something we probably needed more of even before the pandemic. \\u201CNo doubt the thought that you cannot hypothetically access touch,\\u201D Dr. Neel Burton, a psychologist, told the New York Times last fall, \\u201Cmakes the craving worse than it would otherwise be.\\u201D As a species, we were already terrible at admitting our own loneliness; a full 12 (if not more) months spent away from one another isn\\u2019t going to teach us how to ask for more touch in our lives. We just weren\\u2019t built to be staring at each other on screens. In fact, staring at giant floating heads on the monitor you brought home from the office might actually be triggering your fight-or-flight response. And while many of the coping mechanisms for these problems sound perfectly nice \\u2014 send a letter, set regular check-ins with your friends, talk about something other than our collective pulverizing despair \\u2014 none of them are good enough to help us forget about all that we\\u2019ve lost in the last year. My life has always felt like it fit in my phone, but now I resent that convenience. My constant clawing at that little machine feels desperate, like trying to suck moisture out of a rock. I pinball from my laptop to my phone to my iPad, distracting myself from one big screen with another, much smaller screen. I sleep with my phone under my pillow, and it\\u2019s the first thing I grab in the morning, eager for good news. Do I live at work, or do I work at home? Neither: I live on the internet, waiting for the day that someone releases me back into the wild and I can attempt a conversation with someone that doesn\\u2019t include the woman-laughing-into-her-coffee GIF. All my screens perform variations on the same theme: They let me work and they let me watch the trailer for the new Elliot Stabler\\u2013centric Law & Order (17 times). They let me call my friends and patiently walk my father through vaccine sign-up forms. The screens connect me to my therapist, my doctor, my book agent, my editors (I\\u2019ll file when I feel like it!!!), my family in India, my enemies in Canada, and my friend down the street in Brooklyn who still won\\u2019t come outside. I can sit in front of any of my screens and do all the things I did pre-COVID: a half-assed Pilates routine that usually ends in a weepy, frustrated nap. I can attempt my daily crossword while listening to a podcast and thinking about how, you know, I used to do fun things like shots and Whip-Its. I can log on to Twitter and fight with anyone I want over anything at all, from the pettiest of grievances (everyone should be moisturizing their elbows) to things that actually matter (if we feed the raccoons, they will be nice to us when they inevitably inherit the earth). This is the future we wanted, right? Isn\\u2019t this, to some degree, the world we wanted to build? I helped build this world too; I\\u2019ve always been an ardent defender of being on the internet all the time. It\\u2019s a place with its own culture and dialect, both of which I\\u2019ve always innately understood. A few weeks ago, I posted a TikTok on my Instagram stories featuring a teenage girl taking selfies at an incredibly fast clip. A few people replied to it with ire. They told me they hated her and the future she was heralding, calling it navel-gazing and \\u201Cnarcissistic.\\u201D But why be so harsh on a kid who\\u2019s trying to communicate the best she can in the language of her peers, the way she\\u2019s been conditioned to from birth, during a pandemic, when her main outlets for communication are digital? I mean, what else can any of us do aside from use technology to keep us tethered to whatever we need to remain alive? After a year of reaping what we sowed, I am desperate for any kind of in-person, tangible, human experience, even if it\\u2019s a clearly negative one. I want to watch someone throw up on the subway and not have to worry about whether it\\u2019ll lead to me going into full organ failure in two weeks. I want to get in a fight that I can\\u2019t exit by furiously pressing \\u201Cend call\\u201D or slamming my laptop shut. These days, my fantasies are almost all about going back to my third day of seventh grade, when I got into a fistfight on the bus with my \\u201Cfriend,\\u201D resulting in both of us getting suspended. God, how I miss the primal edge of a skin-to-skin brawl. I know this is the best version of the world I could ask for in a quarantine. I know how lucky I am to have been able to stay at home all year, and it\\u2019s with remarkable privilege that I complain about the very technology that has kept me (and almost everyone I know) safe for 12 months. My mother moved from India to Canada in the early \\u201980s with my older brother, who was then a toddler. She always told me stories about the unbearable agony of not being able to get in touch with her parents for days at a time; my grandparents lived in a small two-room apartment without a phone line. She relied entirely on the kindness of their landlord, who would periodically bring my grandparents up to her home to talk to their youngest daughter. They went years without seeing my mom\\u2019s face. They never saw what her house looked like or how she dressed in her new Westernized life. I\\u2019m trying to be grateful that I can hide from illness and fit my mom in my pocket. But the technology I use to stay bound to people I haven\\u2019t seen in the last year has limitations. FaceTime cannot deliver my mother\\u2019s tel malish on my scalp. (I needed it; months after the pandemic was declared, my hair started to come out in clumps, which no YouTube tutorial on hair stimulation remedied.) Instagram commemorations failed to give my uncle-in-law the funeral he deserved, to allow my husband a goodbye he had hoped he wouldn\\u2019t need to give for a few more decades. When my aunt died, there was no ritual that could be transmuted into a digital format. My mother grieved alone. She didn\\u2019t want to talk about it; she just wanted people to be nearby. We couldn\\u2019t make that happen either. iMessage didn\\u2019t bring my friend\\u2019s newborn to any of the people who so desperately wanted to pinch her face, which now, eight months later, looks like a strawberry mochi. This is the best I can get, and it still feels like nothing at all. What\\u2019s the point of a baby if you can\\u2019t smell their head? Every few weeks, someone writes an elegant thinkpiece about how this, now, is the COVID wall. For me, there\\u2019s been a cumulative effect; periodically, there\\u2019s been a new wall to climb. It\\u2019s never easier. It\\u2019s never predictable. It doesn\\u2019t feel like some adversity I need to overcome to better myself; it barely feels survivable. Every six weeks, my husband or my friends need to peel me off the floor and shake me back to life like an old rug full of dirt and cobwebs. I\\u2019ll start the timer again and, like an idiot with no short-term memory, forget that soon I\\u2019ll be back here again, listening to Aimee Mann on repeat in a dry tub, crying about how I haven\\u2019t seen the inside of a museum since November 2019. (How could I know I would one day run out of time for museums?)In the middle of February this year, I hit one of my COVID walls at the same time my parents hit theirs. Fear of getting sick at a tender, vulnerable age had caught up with them after otherwise maintaining optimism about the future, mostly for my sake. \\u201CI\\u2019ve lost so much time,\\u201D my dad told me over FaceTime. That day, he looked gray and tortured \\u2014 Canada\\u2019s vaccination roll-out has been agonizingly slow, meaning they\\u2019re unlikely to fully return to \\u201Cnormal\\u201D until the end of the year. \\u201CTwo years, taken from me.\\u201D I hurried off the phone because I don\\u2019t need that indelible image, one where my otherwise chipper dad is finally crushed by unspeakable horror. Earlier in the pandemic, I could try to feel better by going online, talking to friends, watching movies, and otherwise distracting myself with the endless supply of information I have access to in a digital age. Now, I just want to get on a plane without Wi-Fi and tolerate someone kicking the back of my seat while I drink lukewarm sky coffee. When I play Jackbox online with my friends abroad \\u2014 it includes trivia and Pictionary-style games that you can play in groups from afar \\u2014 I laugh hard and loud, and it feels like a short-lived remedy. But then it\\u2019s midnight, the call ends, and everyone has to go to bed. My apartment is silent and cold; there\\u2019s no dull hum of the comedown from a night out with people you love. It\\u2019s like eating Twizzlers for dinner; you still need a real meal. My parents are in western Canada and thus still a few months away from even the possibility of getting a vaccine. My friends in Toronto, who are all largely young and healthy, are expecting a vaccine around September. My friends in New York are slowly getting vaccinated, but that makes little difference in terms of whether we can press our wretched, hot bodies together in a hug, an action I\\u2019m quickly starting to forget ever existed. Our digital-only lives are not over when we get the poke. It\\u2019s but a reminder that we were never built to avoid in-person interactions or to live most of our lives online. Even for a homebody, this was never the point. Turns out, this is the limitation of a digital-first world. I always thought it would be something else, like sorrow over not getting the newspaper in print anymore, everyone reading novels on Kindles, or movie theaters letting you tweet during the film. But it was much simpler: I just want the ineffable palpability of an offline experience. The digital world has plenty of virtues, but keeping us sane and comforted during a year of devastation and anguish isn\\u2019t its strength. Please, won\\u2019t someone give me what I so sorely need? It doesn\\u2019t need to be a good offline experience; I don\\u2019t need to like it. I\\u2019ll even take that teenaged fistfight. I\\u2019ll take anything \\u2014 as long as it doesn\\u2019t come with a mute button, a dial tone, or a buffer bar. ●"},{"author":"Caroline Haskins","title":"A Twitter Bug May Have Kept You From Muting \"WandaVision\"","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/carolinehaskins1\/twitter-mute-bug-wandavision","content":"If you were trying to protect yourself from WandaVision spoilers (or were just sick of hearing people talk about a show you haven\\u2019t seen yet), you may have noticed that muted words and phrases have still been appearing on your Home feed. It\\u2019s not just you: This is because of a bug, according to a Twitter spokesperson, and the company is working on a fix. Normally, when you mute a word or phrase on Twitter, it stops appearing in your notifications and your Home feed. The default setting when you mute something is \\u201Cfrom anyone\\u201D \\u2014 meaning, from both people you follow and those you don\\u2019t. But some time recently, a Twitter bug changed this setting to \\u201Cfrom people you don\\u2019t follow.\\u201D Since your Twitter Home feed is only made up of people who you follow (and accounts that those people retweet), this basically renders the feature useless.

Eileen Murphy, a spokesperson for the Times, said in a statement that editors approved Brooks's involvement with Aspen in 2018, when he launched a project called Weave. But current editors weren't aware that he was receiving a salary for Weave. \\\"The current Opinion editors were unaware of this arrangement and have concluded that holding a paid position at Weave presents a conflict of interest for David in writing about the work of the project, its donors, or the broader issues it focuses on,\\\" Murphy said. She said that Brooks resigned his position at the institute and will remain a volunteer for the project. \\u201CGoing forward, the Times will disclose this unpaid relationship,\\u201D Murphy said. \\u201CWe are also in the process of adding disclosures to any earlier columns in which David refers to the work of Weave or its donors.\\u201D Brooks\\u2019s resignation comes after BuzzFeed News discovered further evidence of conflicts of interest and entanglements with corporate and billionaire donors to Weave. Brooks did not immediately respond to a request for comment. BuzzFeed News first revealed that Brooks never disclosed to Times readers that he takes a full-time salary for his work on Weave, or that its funders include Facebook, the father of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and other wealthy individuals and corporations. Brooks recently wrote a blog post for Facebook\\u2019s corporate website in praise of Facebook Groups, a product that has often been a fount of misinformation and hate speech. Brooks's behavior raises thorny ethical issues for the Times. By appearing in videos for Weave funders, he's lending the paper's credence to entities in which he has a stake. The revelations of these entanglements have angered the Times\\u2019 newsroom, where reporters, who are typically not allowed to maintain outside jobs that would be perceived as jeopardizing their news judgment, have reported critically on Facebook. Murphy told BuzzFeed News that Brooks did not inform the paper that he was blogging for Facebook or that Weave received funding from the company. His Weave salary was revealed by BuzzFeed News earlier this week. Over the past 24 hours, BuzzFeed News discovered new evidence of potential conflicts. On March 15 of last year, as Americans faced a deadly pandemic, Brooks appeared on Meet the Press and offered some advice. \\\"We need to take moral steps to make ourselves decent neighbors to each other as we go through this thing. I think people should get on Nextdoor, this sort of \\u2018Facebook for neighbors,\\u2019\\u201D he said. Left unsaid by Brooks was that Nextdoor, a social network for neighborhoods, had donated $25,000 to Weave. A day before his appearance on the nationally televised NBC program, Brooks also tweeted to his nearly 250,000 followers, \\u201CIf you know someone who lives alone, ask them to join NextDoor.\\u201DAnother new revelation: Last month, Brooks appeared in a Walton Family Foundation video and did not disclose that the organization, run by the billionaire family who founded Walmart, also funds his project. Brooks\\u2019s failure to disclose these conflicts of interest added to the string of ethically questionable actions by the columnist and author related to his work on Weave. The Aspen Institute told BuzzFeed News that Facebook\\u2019s funding of Weave ended in 2019. However, Facebook is listed as a financial supporter of a project that Weave helped launch and run in 2020, #WeavingCommunity During Crisis. The Aspen Institute said in a statement that the funds were managed by its partner, the Listen First Project. Still, Facebook's financing of a Weave partnership means that Brooks had a connection to the company when he blogged for its website and appeared in a video it produced. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Nextdoor spokesperson confirmed the company\\u2019s partnership with Weave but declined to give further details. After declining to say if it would release information about all Weave donors, the Aspen Institute provided BuzzFeed News with a list of Weave funders Friday night. Brooks has not responded to multiple requests for comment from BuzzFeed News. He made his first public comments about the growing scandal during his weekly Friday segment on the PBS NewsHour on March 5. While defending his work on Weave, Brooks made two false statements. Asked about his failure to disclose that Facebook helped fund Weave, Brooks said that \\\"we totally did disclose it because everything is public.\\u201D The Aspen Institute has only publicly posted a list of Weave donations from 2018. Facebook is not on the list, and Brooks did not acknowledge taking a donation from the company to Times readers or to his current bosses at the paper. Brooks also falsely stated that \\\"the Aspen Institute is completely transparent about who the donors are, and so we released the donors.\\\" Ultimately, the Aspen Institute didn\\u2019t release its 2018 figures until asked by BuzzFeed News. Nick Massella, a PBS NewsHour spokesperson, told BuzzFeed News that the program was \\u201Caware David was working with the Aspen Institute on this project but not of its funding nature.\\u201D Massella did not respond to a request for comment about Brooks\\u2019s false statements on the show. Brooks did not respond to a request for comment about his appearances on the PBS NewsHour and Meet the Press. BuzzFeed News first asked the Aspen Institute to disclose a full list of Weave funders on March 4. It declined to say if it would. But after Brooks\\u2019s appearance on the PBS NewsHour the next day and another inquiry from BuzzFeed News, the institute released what it said is a complete tally of Weave donors. They include billionaires, their family members, and other philanthropists, like Jacklyn G. and Miguel A. Bezos, the parents of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos; the Resnick Foundation, the nonprofit of POM Wonderful founders Stewart and Lynda Resnick; the Einhorn Collaborative, the nonprofit of hedge fund manager David Einhorn; financier Robert K. Steel and his wife, Gillian; investor John B. Fullerton and his wife, Jessica; the Penner Family Foundation, the nonprofit of Walmart heiress Carrie Walton Penner; TPG Capital Founder James Coulter and his wife, Penny; cannabis entrepreneur Pete Kadens; the Crown family, which is led by businessperson Lester Crown; and the Walton Family Foundation. Weave\\u2019s corporate sponsors include Allstate, Walmart, Facebook, M&T Bank, and Nextdoor. Brooks has written frequently about income inequality for the Times. \\u201CSome people who talk about inequality focus on the top 1 percent, and if you want to go after the hedge fund billionaires feel free,\\u201D he wrote in an April column. \\u201CBut as inequality is actually lived out, it\\u2019s the 20\\\/80 gap that is most glaring and most unjust.\\u201D Nextdoor declined to say how much money it gave Weave, but the Aspen Institute told BuzzFeed News that \\u201CNextdoor provided $25,000 to support several events, including a three-day national gathering held in Washington, DC.\\u201D The Aspen Institute previously said that Facebook gave Weave $250,000 in December 2018 and told BuzzFeed News that \\u201CWeave has received no other funds from Facebook.\\u201D But in 2020, Weave was one of two organizations that launched the program #WeavingCommunity During Crisis, and Facebook is listed among the project's financial donors. A review of the Twitter accounts for #WeavingCommunity and Weave show that the organizations repeatedly promoted Facebook as a tool to connect communities. In one example, Weave lauded a program that gave Facebook Portal video conferencing devices to seniors in nursing homes. \\u201CThe grateful reactions have ranged from \\u2018tears of joy\\u2019 to an overwhelming sense of relief,\\u201D Weave tweeted. In his Friday appearance on the PBS NewsHour, Brooks, the author of books including The Road to Character, said that he would address \\u201Cconcerns\\u201D about his work with Weave. But he rejected the idea that he had done anything wrong and had misled the audience about what had been publicly disclosed about Weave\\u2019s funding. In a May 2019 appearance on the PBS NewsHour, Brooks talked about the importance of ethical standards in journalism. \\u201CThe one thing legacy media has is, we have basic standards below which it's unimaginable to sink ... ,\\u201D he said. \\u201CAnd if you do make an error, you correct it.\\u201D"},{"author":"Caroline Haskins","title":"Influencers' Mirror Pictures Might Not Be Mirror Pictures At All","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/carolinehaskins1\/influencer-mirror-pictures-tiktok-theory","content":"In 2021, it\\u2019s obvious most people understand that what influencers post on social media doesn\\u2019t actually reflect reality: They slim their faces and bodies, remove blemishes, use heavy filters, and precisely frame shots to give viewers the impression that their lives are casually desirable. But a new theory circulating on social media argues that influencers are warping reality in a new way \\u2014 by staging their mirror pictures. My colleague Tanya Chen first reported on this growing theory, strengthened by the fact that model and influencer Kara Del Toro claims to fake her own mirror pictures by using a second camera. In a recent video, which has over 380,000 views at the time of writing, TikTok user @katathomedoingnothing explained that most mirror pictures have small imperfections and blemishes. The light glares in strange ways, there are smudges, and there\\u2019s dust. But when some influencers hold up their phones in an image that appears to have been taken in a mirror, there\\u2019s often no glare, smudges, or dust. Which raises the question: Do influencers happen to have extraordinarily clean and perfectly placed mirrors? Or...are they asking someone else to take a picture of them, while they hold up their own phones, in order to give the appearance of a mirror picture without the actual mirror?Naomi Anwer, one of the influencers who's accused of faking a mirror picture in the TikTok, told BuzzFeed News that her picture shown in the video was an authentic mirror picture. She also showed BuzzFeed News the entire mirror, which was cropped out in the picture she eventually posted on Instagram. \\u201CWhaaaaat the hell,\\u201D she said. \\u201CI had no clue \\u2014 but these were all taken in a mirror? Don\\u2019t get why not haha.\\u201D Regardless of whether the theory is true, it seems to resonate with people on TikTok because the lifestyles that influencers sell already don\\u2019t feel real, and people have come to assume that nearly everything must be staged. The other reason the video has resonated with people is the sheer fact that it\\u2019s actually plausible. Influencers, generally speaking, promote an aspirational lifestyle on social media, which is supported by doing advertisements and promoting paying brands. But their lifestyles aren\\u2019t merely aspirational \\u2014 they also need to seem accessible while leading their effortless and aesthetically pleasing lives. Celebrities give up the illusion of accessible lifestyles when they appear in glossy magazines and on film and TV. Influencers, meanwhile, maintain that illusion by giving fans 24\\\/7 access into their most banal and intimate moments by posting stories and vlogs throughout their day. And yet, influencers do not post casually. It often takes them hours to stage an off-the-cuff peek into their lives, and they even have people helping them behind the scenes to ensure that things come out just right. As a format, mirror pictures are meant to portray someone at their most casual \\u2014 in a bathroom, or in a public setting \\u2014 to show that they are simply moving through the world. But for someone who gets paid to post on social media, it would seemingly make sense that every picture they take is staged, even a mirror picture. Why deal with the inconveniences and imperfections of an actual mirror (glares, smudges, and dust) when you can just have someone else take the picture for you? That way, an influencer can be coached, they can control the lighting, and a professional camera can be used \\u2014 all while maintaining the veneer of nonchalance and effortlessness. Of course, they may just have a very clean, well-lit mirror. But once you start asking whether a picture was actually taken in a mirror, it\\u2019s hard to stop."},{"author":"Katie Notopoulos","title":"Instagram Live \"Rooms\" Let Four People Go Live Together","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/katienotopoulos\/instagram-launches-live-rooms","content":"Instagram is expanding its livestreaming function, which will now allow up to four people to go live on a split screen. Now, your smallish Zooms or camera-ready Clubhouse discussions can happen in Instagram Live Rooms. \\u201CThe number one request we heard was: \\u2018How can I bring in more than one person?\\u2019\\u201D Vishal Shah, head of product for Instagram, told BuzzFeed News. During the pandemic, going live on Instagram with another user, a feature that launched in 2017, has become increasingly popular. The live music series Verzuz started at the beginning of the pandemic, filling the void for live music with performers like Jill Scott and Erykah Badu using the \\\"Live with\\\" feature. The pandemic has also created a demand for virtual hangouts, and Instagram Live has become a useful tool for celebrity interviews and collaborations between creators. When two people go on Live together, both of their followers get notified, expanding their reach. Instagram has already rolled out the four-person rooms in India and Indonesia, where Shah said uses have included tutorials from makeup artists, discussions on plant care, and content from other types of creators. The feature will be rolling out worldwide starting today, although some people may not see it right away. Monetization features that already exist in Live, like paid badges or fundraisers to outside charities will be possible in the four-way chats. For moderation and privacy, anyone blocked by any of the four people on Live will not be able to watch the stream. Instagram has been more conservative about big new features compared to Facebook, which owns the platform, and has stayed simpler to use. Its latest big new feature was Reels, a TikTok clone, which a recent redesign put into the center button of the app to encourage more engagement. Expanding Live to more people makes the feature more similar to a panel discussion or group talk show, a format that\\u2019s proven wildly popular on Clubhouse, the audio chatroom app. Twitter and Facebook are both looking into creating their own versions of an audio chatroom, with Twitter launching Spaces, and Facebook reportedly building its own version. Of course, live video is very different from audio-only \\u2014 part of Clubhouse\\u2019s appeal is that you don\\u2019t have to be camera-ready to jump into the discussion, and you can listen in the background like a podcast. On the other hand, it can be hard to tell when to speak without the visual cues in other people\\u2019s faces, making a lot of Clubhouse chats a constant stream of \\u201Coh, sorry, go ahead\\u2026\\u201D After the last year, we\\u2019ve all gotten much more comfortable on group video chats, so the Live Rooms seems a natural extension. Thankfully, Shah said a key feature will be coming soon: the mute button."},{"author":"Craig Silverman","title":"NYT Columnist David Brooks Blogged For Facebook\u2019s Corporate Site","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/craigsilverman\/nyt-david-brooks-blogs-for-facebook","content":"On Tuesday, New York Times columnist David Brooks published a 900-word ode to Facebook Groups and how they foster online communities around the world. The column didn\\u2019t appear in Brooks\\u2019s usual spot in the Times, where he\\u2019s had a popular opinion column since 2003. Instead, it was published on Facebook\\u2019s corporate website to promote a new study of groups that was funded by the social media giant. \\u201CFacebook Groups has 1.8 billion users, and more than half of them are in five or more groups. Clearly people have come to really value the communities they are building online,\\u201D Brooks writes. \\u201CIt\\u2019s not social media that\\u2019s the problem, it\\u2019s the ideas and behavior of the people who use it,\\u201D he says. Brooks did not respond to a request for comment, but Eileen Murphy, a spokesperson for the New York Times, told BuzzFeed News that editors for the Times were not aware of his work with Facebook, and that he was not compensated for his Facebook blog post or for a recent panel appearance for the social network. She noted that Brooks\\u2019s work was done in conjunction with the Aspen Institute\\u2019s Weave Project, a local community-building initiative that was founded by the Times writer. \\u201CDavid\\u2019s editors were not aware of the blog post or panel discussion, and they are discussing with him now what additional steps he might take to make sure that his work with the Weave project doesn't create any appearance of conflicts with his Times journalism,\\u201D Murphy said.A spokesperson for the Aspen Institute, a Washington, DC\\u2013based think tank, confirmed to BuzzFeed News that the Weave Project has received funding from Facebook. \\u201CA number of our programs, including Weave: The Social Fabric Project, work with Facebook in accordance with their missions and have accepted funding for specific projects,\\u201D the spokesperson said. Brooks\\u2019s ties to Facebook raise questions of conflicts of interest at the world\\u2019s most influential newspaper, and highlight how the social network is working to rehabilitate its brand after years of criticism and scrutiny for its roles in spreading conspiracy theories, fomenting hate, and influencing elections. The revelation of the social network\\u2019s ties to Brooks and his Aspen Institute work comes after the company has shifted its focus to emphasize building communities in Facebook Groups, despite internal research suggesting that the product fosters polarization, radicalization, and misinformation. Over the years, Facebook has bought newspaper and online advertisements in news publications and also run sponsored content, paid posts that are meant to look like native articles. It has also funded journalism initiatives and paid news organizations to feature their content, including for its Facebook News vertical, which was launched in Oct. 2019. (BuzzFeed News is paid by Facebook as part of that program, though the company has no say over editorial matters.) Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone said Brooks was not compensated for his blog post or his appearance on a Facebook-organized video panel on Tuesday, but did confirm the company\\u2019s funding of the Aspen Institute, which oversees Weave. \\u201CFacebook has disclosed publicly for years its financial support for the Aspen Institute,\\u201D he said in an email. Brooks\\u2019s post appeared on Facebook\\u2019s website on Tuesday, identifying him as a \\u201CFounder of the Aspen Institute\\u2019s Weave Project and New York Times Columnist.\\u201D Brooks, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who has written Times columns about Facebook and social media in general, is one of the publication\\u2019s most recognizable writers and maintains commentary roles with NPR and PBS NewsHour. \\u201COnline communities are in their early years, and it\\u2019s natural everything is a little haphazard,\\u201D Brooks writes for Facebook. \\u201CBut I\\u2019m hopeful that we can build systems around these communities, to make them stronger, deeper and the engines of trust we need to build healthy societies.\\u201D The post was timed with the release of a report on Facebook Groups titled \\u201CThe Power of Virtual Communities\\u201D that was put together by New York University\\u2019s Governance Lab, which had received a $300,000 grant from the social network and worked with the company\\u2019s Community Partnerships team to find Groups admins to interview for the report. In addition to his writing, Brooks also appeared in a video panel organized by Facebook on Tuesday to discuss the research. Kathleen Culver, director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin\\u2013Madison, said Brooks has a responsibility to disclose to his editors, and to readers, his connections with the Aspen Institute and Facebook. \\u201CIf the Times and David Brooks are asking people to trust his opinion journalism, then he should be clear about any entanglements that might affect the independence of that journalism,\\u201D she said. Brooks\\u2019s post for Facebook painted a rosy picture of how people use Groups to create community connections. \\u201CThey heavily rely on social media sites like Facebook to communicate with their communities, to deepen relationships, to do their work. I would say they are suspicious of Facebook the corporation, but I\\u2019m struck by how often they are glowing about what they can do on Facebook with their neighbors,\\u201D he writes. His post did not mention recent reporting from BuzzFeed News and the Wall Street Journal that revealed Facebook has known for years that Groups are an engine of polarization and misinformation, and that the company failed to move quickly to enact changes that could protect users. Beth Simone Noveck, director of the Governance Lab at NYU and a coauthor of the NYU report about Facebook Groups, said her team was aware of the ethical issues of working with Facebook and accepting money from the company to produce the report. NYU\\u2019s GovLab has received $700,000 in funding from Facebook since 2019, including $300,000 for the Groups report. For the research, Facebook connected academics with more than 50 administrators of large Groups, and shared data from a survey as well as selected internal data, with restrictions. \\u201CThe challenge is not lost on us and we're very aware of the tension it creates,\\u201D she said, adding that the team included text in the final report to acknowledge the Jan. 6 insurrection was partly organized using social media, including Facebook Groups. The report describes how the researchers worked with Facebook, and flags instances when Facebook shared internal data but would not offer full transparency about the origins of the information. Noveck said the goal of the report was to focus on \\u201Chow these large-scale social groups are governed, and how they relate to the platform.\\u201D She acknowledged the negative aspects of Groups, but said it wasn\\u2019t their focus. \\u201CThat there is neo-Nazi activity, hate speech activity, and misinformation galore. Arguably you could say you don\\u2019t want that to obscure lots of great things going on. We need to tell both of these stories,\\u201D she said. Noveck said the researchers were free to write what they wanted, but Facebook did read the report before publication, and provided graphic design and translation services. \\u201CFacebook didn\\u2019t have veto power over what we wrote,\\u201D she said. \\u201CThey saw [the report] before it was published.\\u201D Culver said Facebook\\u2019s influence and big bank account will continue to be a source of concerns about conflicts of interest and editorial independence. \\u201CWhen you have an organization as large and as moneyed as Facebook, these entanglements can add up really quickly,\\u201D she said."},{"author":"Ryan Mac","title":"Facebook Considers Facial Recognition For Smart Glasses","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/ryanmac\/facebook-considers-facial-recognition-smart-glasses","content":"Facebook is discussing building facial recognition into its upcoming smart glasses product and has been weighing the legal implications of the controversial technology, executives said at an internal meeting Thursday. During a scheduled companywide meeting, Andrew Bosworth, Facebook\\u2019s vice president of augmented and virtual reality, told employees that the company is currently assessing whether or not it has the legal capacity to offer facial recognition on devices that are reportedly set to launch later this year. Nothing had been decided, he said, and he noted that current state laws may make it impossible for Facebook to offer people the ability to search for others based on pictures of their face. \\u201CFace recognition ... might be the thorniest issue, where the benefits are so clear, and the risks are so clear, and we don\\u2019t know where to balance those things,\\u201D Bosworth said in response to an employee question about whether people would be able to \\u201Cmark their faces as unsearchable\\u201D when smart glasses become a prevalent technology. The unnamed worker specifically highlighted fears about the potential for \\u201Creal-world harm,\\u201D including \\u201Cstalkers.\\u201D Following publication of this story, Bosworth wrote on Twitter that \\\"we\\u2019ve been open about our efforts to build [augmented reality] glasses and are still in the early stages.\\\" \\\"Face recognition is a hugely controversial topic and for good reason and I was speaking about was how we are going to have to have a very public discussion about the pros and cons,\\\" he said. Facebook has been touting a smart glasses product since last year, saying that it will arrive \\u201Csooner than later\\u201D in 2021. Built in partnership with Ray-Ban and its parent company, Luxottica Group, the wearable devices are expected to rival products from competitors Snapchat and Amazon, providing an augmented reality experience that will overlay digital features on people\\u2019s real-world perspectives. Bosworth\\u2019s comments about a Facebook facial recognition device come at a time of heated debate and scrutiny of the technology, which has been deployed by federal agencies, police departments, and even private companies \\u2014 often in the name of safety and security. Critics and academics have decried the lack of federal regulation over the technology, which they say could undermine individual privacy. Some cities, including San Francisco and Boston, have already banned it from government use. Facebook, which has one of the largest repositories of user-uploaded photos, has taken a cautious approach to facial recognition. In 2015, it deployed a system called DeepFace that it\\u2019s since used to power features, such as photo tag suggestions, to identify people in pictures. Unlike Amazon, which sells its facial recognition tool to other companies and public entities, Facebook has not marketed DeepFace or any of its other facial recognition technologies for use beyond its own social network. In his remarks Thursday, Bosworth said he has been discussing facial recognition with CEO Mark Zuckerberg and he was overseeing a privacy review for the smart glasses product later in the day. Late last year, the vice president also noted in an internal memo, first reported by the Big Technology newsletter, that the company should \\u201Cdifferentiate our products on the basis of privacy.\\u201D \\u201CWe should become the undisputed leaders in providing privacy aware software,\\u201D Bosworth wrote in December.While Bosworth said he understood privacy concerns over facial recognition on Thursday, he criticized current legislation, including Illinois\\u2019 Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), which prevents private companies from collecting and storing biometric data like face scans without people\\u2019s consent. He noted the law was passed in 2008 and questioned how such out-of-date legislation could apply to the technologies of today. Last year, Facebook was ordered to pay $650 million to Illinois citizens for violating BIPA with its photo-tagging feature. \\u201CThe real question is whether we will be able to recognize any faces at all, and we don\\u2019t know. Legally, the answer might be no, if you\\u2019re familiar with BIPA in Illinois ... people are making face recognition illegal,\\u201D Bosworth told employees Thursday. \\u201CThat\\u2019s ok. We can do that as a society and this product will survive and thrive without it. I do think there are some lost opportunities, though.\\u201D In explaining possible use cases of facial recognition, Bosworth said that Facebook\\u2019s smart glasses may help someone recognize someone at a dinner party if they can\\u2019t remember their name or if they have face blindness. During the conversation, Facebook Chief Diversity Officer Maxine Williams noted that Facebook may need to develop its own principles on facial recognition that would take precedence in places where there are currently no laws governing the technology. \\u201CJust because you can [build something,] doesn\\u2019t mean you will,\\u201D she added, noting that the company would have to consider the product\\u2019s potential for harm and discrimination. As Facebook explores the possibility of adding facial recognition to future products, it\\u2019s been sparring with a company that scraped its photos and data to build its own facial recognition tool. Clearview AI, which has provided its software to hundreds of police departments, federal agencies, and private companies, trained its facial recognition tool, in part, on photos taken from Facebook and Instagram. While Facebook said previously that it\\u2019s sent cease and desist letters to Clearview for violating its terms of service, the company has yet to take legal action against the New York City\\u2013based startup. Facebook board member Peter Thiel was an early investor in Clearview."},{"author":"Christopher Miller","title":"This Lawmaker Wants To Label Foreign White Supremacist Groups \"Terrorists.\"","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/christopherm51\/slotkin-label-foreign-white-supremacists-terrorists","content":"Rep. Elissa Slotkin last week sent a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken asking him to take the unprecedented step of designating 13 extremist movements as foreign terrorist organizations, arguing that such a move \\u201Cwill help apply more stress to curtail these violent organizations\\u2019 and their leaders\\u2019 ability to operate their groups.\\u201D But of the 13 groups listed in her letter, which her office provided to BuzzFeed News, at least four are defunct, one is an American club founded in California that has splintered and rebranded, and another changed the name used in Slotkin\\u2019s letter six years ago when it became part of an allied nation\\u2019s national guard. \\u201CIt was a great list \\u2014 in 2018,\\u201D Matthew Feldman, director of the London-based Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right, told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CEvery one of [the listed groups] was active. Every one was dangerous.\\u201D Feldman praised Slotkin\\u2019s efforts and the motivation behind the list, saying they are a step in the right direction. But he also said it serves as an example of how the US government has been slow to recognize the threat posed by far-right violent extremists at home and abroad. Biden has signaled his intent to combat domestic violent extremists \\u2014 specifically white supremacists like those who were among the mob that attacked the US Capitol on Jan. 6, and whom the FBI sees as a top threat. Department of Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas told lawmakers last month that domestic violent extremism \\u201Cposes the most lethal and persistent terrorism-related threat to the homeland today.\\u201D But experts say it is also important to go after foreign extremist groups, which often communicate, coordinate, and inspire their American counterparts. If the Biden administration were to list groups like those suggested by Slotkin, a Democrat from Michigan, as official Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs), or the lesser designation of Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT), it would help curb dangerous white supremacist organizations, the member of Congress argued in her letter, which was previously reported by Reuters. \\u201CIt would also give the United States Government more tools to engage and flag the Americans who contact, support, train, and join these [white supremacist extremist] groups,\\u201D wrote Slotkin. But Elizabeth Neumann, the former assistant secretary of counterterrorism and threat prevention at the Department of Homeland Security during the Donald Trump administration, told BuzzFeed News that the process is lengthy and difficult. \\u201CThe FTO process is a pretty high bar,\\u201D she said. \\u201CI was frustrated we were only able to get the Russian Imperial Movement. That was not the only group we looked at.\\u201D In April 2020, the US designated RIM and three of its leaders SDGTs \\u2014 the first time such a classification had been used. Asked about Slotkin\\u2019s letter, a State Department spokesperson told BuzzFeed News, \\u201Cas a general matter, we do not comment on congressional correspondence and we do not comment on designations or deliberations related to potential designations.\\u201D But Blinken told MSNBC\\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday that designating overseas white supremacist groups as foreign terrorist organizations is \\u201Csomething we\\u2019re looking at.\\u201D A former CIA analyst who focused on foreign terrorist organizations in the Middle East, Slotkin wrote that she has been \\u201Cstruck by the threat these white supremacist groups pose, the amount of contact they have with extremists in the U.S., the minimal intelligence and diplomatic reporting we have on these groups, and the relative lack of review taken by the U.S. Government.\\u201D Among those Slotkin said deserve terrorist designations is the National Action Group, a neo-Nazi organization founded in the United Kingdom and banned in 2016 that targeted British youth. A 2018 US counterterrorism report described it as a terrorist group promoting violence against politicians and minorities. A Metropolitan Police officer named Ben Hannam was convicted of membership on April 1. Another is the neo-Nazi Nordic Resistance Movement, which the same 2018 US report described as an anti-Western transnational organization behind violent attacks, including against Muslims and left-wing groups. But not all of the groups she has asked the government to focus on are currently active. Kacper Rekawek, a Slovakia-based researcher at the nonprofit Counter Extremism Project, said Slotkin\\u2019s list is the type of list someone searching for far-right extremist groups on Google might draw up. \\u201CThe effort of Rep. Slotkin is commendable. Designations, underused in the European context, should help with countering the threat of violence from extreme right-wing organizations,\\u201D Rekawek told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CHowever, this must be informed by a thorough analysis of the local far-right scenes which include a plethora of actors who often talk the talk, but do not walk the walk as far as violence is concerned.\\u201D The neo-Nazi groups Feuerkrieg Division, Sonnenkrieg Division, Atomwaffen Division Deutschland, and Northern Order \\u2014 all on Slotkin\\u2019s list \\u2014 are defunct, Rekawek and Feldman said. Members of the groups \\u2014 all of which were inspired by the US Atomwaffen Division and American neo-Nazi James Mason\\u2019s \\u201CSiege culture,\\u201D \\u2014 were tied to violence or violent plots in the UK, the US, Germany, Canada, and elsewhere. Rise Above Movement (RAM), a white supremacist fight club founded in Southern California with ties to neo-Nazi groups in Ukraine and the Balkans, was also more or less disbanded after three of its members were imprisoned for participating in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in August 2017. RAM\\u2019s founder, New York native Robert Rundo, was charged in a separate federal case for violence at several protests across California. The charges were dismissed in June 2019 but reinstated last month. He\\u2019s now reportedly hiding from authorities in Bosnia after he was banned from Serbia following a Bellingcat report that said he was trying to plant roots in the country. After this story published, Slotkin's staff clarified they included RAM on the list as a way of identifying the group's foreign affiliates. Another problematic group on Slotkin\\u2019s list is Ukraine\\u2019s Azov Battalion. The paramilitary force was formed in 2014 by far-right extremists who volunteered to take up arms against Russia-backed forces when the war in eastern Ukraine broke out. In January 2016, it became part of the country\\u2019s National Guard and has since been known as the Azov Regiment. Its political wing, National Corps, has been labeled a \\u201Cnationalist hate group\\u201D by the State Department. But designating the regiment as a foreign terrorist organization is likely to pose challenges, especially due to its attachment to the state and the fact that Ukraine is a US ally. BuzzFeed News reached out to Slotkin for comment on the list. An aide said they had been made aware of the status of Azov and the disbanded groups after the representative's letter was reported by Reuters. But, the aide said, they plan to move ahead with at least the groups on the list which remain active. \\u201CWe\\u2019re confident we can get some level of designation,\\u201D the aide said.

On Monday, the canal's service provider announced the ship had been refloated and was on its merry way.Rescue teams in tugboats had spent six days working to free the ship, and were finally successful thanks, in part, to the full moon bringing high tides. A Dutch company that assisted in efforts to wiggle the boat free had previously compared the vessel to a \\\"beached whale\\\" and said it \\\"might take weeks\\\" to accomplish, according to Reuters.

During the call, campaigners said the Beijing Games would legitimize the Chinese government\\u2019s escalating human rights abuses. \\u201CYou, ladies and gentlemen, have your own responsibilities,\\u201D replied Juan Antonio Samaranch, chair of the IOC Coordination Commission for the upcoming Winter Games, according to contemporaneous notes seen by BuzzFeed News. \\u201CWe have ours.\\u201D The activists pointed to the mass detention of Muslims in Xinjiang, the crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong, and the continued repression in Tibet. But the IOC officials batted away their questions by claiming that the 2008 Beijing Olympics had led to better air quality and public transportation, according to the notes and to interviews with several activists involved.Calling it the \\u201Cgenocide Olympics,\\u201D dozens of human rights groups have urged the IOC to move the games to a different country, with some comparing the upcoming competition to the one held in Nazi Germany in 1936. The US and Canada have publicly called China's treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang a genocide. In response to a detailed list of questions for this article, the IOC said it factored in NGOs\\u2019 views on issues including human rights for the Beijing Games. The committee said it raised these issues with the government and local authorities, who assured it that they would respect the Olympic Charter. \\u201CGiven the diverse participation in the Olympic Games, the IOC must remain neutral on all global political issues,\\u201D the IOC said in an email. \\u201CAwarding the Olympic Games to a National Olympic Committee does not mean that the IOC agrees with the political structure, social circumstances or human rights standards in its country.\\u201D The IOC upholds human rights principles outlined in the Olympic Charter, it said, and \\u201Ctakes this responsibility very seriously.\\u201D \\u201CAt the same time,\\u201D it said, \\u201Cthe IOC has neither the mandate nor the capability to change the laws or the political system of a sovereign country. This must rightfully remain the legitimate role of governments and respective intergovernmental organisations.\\u201D The IOC has repeatedly emphasized its neutrality in response to questions about the ethics of holding the games in China. But in the private video call on Oct. 6, 2020, IOC officials went further. The call, which lasted more than an hour and was attended by a group of six activists and five IOC officials, started out hopeful but ended up strained, according to some of the activists on the call. The officials argued that the Olympics could be a catalyst for better infrastructure. They pointed to the 2008 Summer Olympics, arguing that when Beijing hosted that year, it spurred improvements in infrastructure and air quality. \\u201CThey still have issues of air quality, but for the first time, they were mentioning that the blue sky is called \\u2018Olympic Blue\\u2019 because \\u2026 it was the first time they could see blue air in Beijing,\\u201D one official said, according to the notes. Teng Biao, one of China\\u2019s best-known human rights lawyers, was on the call. He told BuzzFeed News he was not impressed. \\u201CIt\\u2019s too difficult to defend the Chinese government in terms of human rights or rule of law,\\u201D Teng told BuzzFeed News. \\u201CSo they can only find something like environmental policies.\\u201D \\\"Holding the Olympics in Beijing again can be seen as an endorsement of the CCP\\u2019s atrocities including the Uyghur genocide,\\\" he said. Teng lived in Beijing during the 2008 Olympics and said that, like other human rights lawyers, he was banned from travel, detained and tortured while in police custody ahead of the games. He said he told the officials that his experience shows that holding the Olympics in Beijing again can bring harm. Police could not be reached for comment. But IOC officials seemed indifferent, Teng said. Samaranch, the IOC\\u2019s coordination commission chair, said during the call that the games are \\u201Can extraordinary force for good,\\u201D bringing together people of different races and religions \\u201Cand even political systems, ladies and gentlemen, even political systems,\\u201D according to the notes seen by BuzzFeed News. \\u201CThe world lives under many political systems,\\u201D he added. \\u201CWe cannot go and say and endorse one or the other.\\u201D Zumretay Arkin, program and advocacy manager at the World Uyghur Congress, told the IOC officials on the call that she has missing relatives in Xinjiang. She said the officials told her they were sorry to hear it, but the world is a complicated place \\u2014 a recollection echoed by the notes as well as other activists present at the meeting. Arkin told BuzzFeed News she strongly disagreed with the IOC officials. \\u201CEverything got worse since 2008,\\u201D she said. \\u201CWe have a full-on genocide, we have people in concentration camps, and you\\u2019re telling us the situation didn\\u2019t get worse?\\u201D \\u201CWe are suffering from these policies,\\u201D she added. \\u201CYou would never think about hosting the games in North Korea or some other places. Why is China different?\\u201D Dorjee Tseten, executive director of Students for a Free Tibet, said he told the officials that he and others have risked retaliation for themselves and their families to publicly protest the IOC\\u2019s decision. He also noted that many Buddhist monks and other ethnic Tibetans have been detained or killed during the government\\u2019s decadeslong campaign. Violent demonstrations broke out in Tibet ahead of the 2008 Games, and at the time the president of the IOC said the protests were a \\\"crisis\\\" for the organization. But the officials on the video call didn\\u2019t seem to care, Tseten said. \\u201CI was shocked,\\u201D he said. \\u201CHow can I explain the cold faces? They were not even acknowledging the suffering.\\u201D Arkin, Teng, and Tseten said discussions with the IOC have continued since October, including in a second call this month, but Arkin said nothing substantial has changed. Politicians in the US and Europe, including former US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, have in recent months called for governments to boycott the games. Critics say that might unfairly penalize athletes. But activists say they see a diplomatic boycott as their only option, since it\\u2019s unlikely the IOC will move the games. Human rights groups are also seeking to pressure companies such as Airbnb to sever sponsorship ties with the 2022 Games. Tseten and others who were involved in protests leading up to the 2008 Games say China\\u2019s crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong and the abuses in Xinjiang mean they're even less defensible this time around. \\u201CWe told them, at the end, this will be a genocide games,\\u201D Tseten said. \\u201CAnd in history, the IOC will go down as part of that.\\u201D"},{"author":"Michelle Del Rey","title":"Yocairi Amarante Rodríguez Speaks About Acid Attack","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/michelledelrey\/yocairi-amarante-rodriguez-acid-attack-dominican-republic","content":"SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic \\u2014 Yocairi Amarante Rodríguez was heading to a beauty salon in Santo Domingo last fall when two men on a motorcycle sped up to her car and chucked a container of \\\"ácido del diablo,\\\" containing sulfuric acid used for plumbing and sewer cleaning, through an open window and onto her face. At first, she thought, Damn it, they\\u2019ve thrown coffee on me, she recalled in an interview with BuzzFeed News. But then the liquid started to burn. The 19-year-old jumped out of the car, crying for help as bits of clothing and skin melted off her body. The driver was also injured. \\u201CThey\\u2019ve thrown acid on her!\\u201D she remembers a woman nearby shouting. She was rushed to the hospital. It was Sept. 25. Days earlier, the man who police said planned the attack \\u2014 her ex-boyfriend \\u2014 directed an alleged accomplice on how to carry out the attack, according to documents obtained at the Ciudad Nueva Courthouse. \\u201CEn la misma cara en la frente,\\u201D he allegedly wrote in a text. \\u201COn the face, the forehead.\\u201D Her attack is reflective of increasing violence against women in Latin America. It gained widespread attention, including a passionate video from Cardi B on Instagram. Amarante Rodríguez spoke at length for the first time about the assault and the recovery process with BuzzFeed News, which can also reveal details from court records and police documents detailing the lengths at which her ex-boyfriend, Willy Antonio Javier Monegro, allegedly physically and verbally abused her before her appearance and life were permanently altered. She now intends to use people\\u2019s generous donations to open a salon of her own. Amarante Rodríguez was treated at one of the Dominican Republic\\u2019s only burn units. \\u201CShe almost died,\\u201D said Dr. Eddy Bruno, burn unit director at Ney Arias Lora Hospital. Before treating Amarante Rodríguez in person, Bruno reviewed photos of her, which showed burns on her face, neck, and right leg. Doctors were forced to let the acid act for up to five days before treating her, he said. She would remain in Bruno\\u2019s care for two months, during which she would undergo about nine surgeries to remove dead tissue and apply skin grafts. She was discharged in November 2020, and she has a long road to recovery ahead. She\\u2019s lost her right eye, more than 50% of the vision in her left eye, and her right nipple. Hypertrophic scars caused by the acid run down her neck, chest, breasts, arms, and legs. Amarante Rodríguez spent days working in her sister\\u2019s salon braiding hair and playing with curling irons as a girl. Now, parts of her scalp will never grow hair again. \\u201CLook at how I was before,\\u201D she said, scrolling through photos on her phone of herself with long curly hair and light hazel eyes. \\u201CNow look at how I am,\\u201D she said, stripping the bandages off her face and lifting up her shirt to expose her scars. \\u201CThat\\u2019s how he left me.\\u201DAs she was recovering in the hospital, news of her attack spread on social media. Cardi B posted a video on Instagram holding a Barbie doll dressed in scrubs and slamming it down on a table feetfirst. \\u201CPeople of the Dominican Republic,\\u201D she says in Spanish in the video. \\u201CI\\u2019m going to tell my dad to put me in contact with the police or any person of the Dominican Republic, and I\\u2019m going to offer $10,000 \\u2014 not pesos, $10,000 \\u2014 to whoever finds the people that are responsible for throwing devil\\u2019s acid on that girl whose face they burned.\\u201D She added, \\u201CThere should be justice.\\u201D Santiago Matías, a popular Dominican radio personality, posted on his Instagram that he donated roughly $1,700 to help with her medical expenses and put up about $5,000 for information on the perpetrators. For Amarante Rodríguez, who made around $224 a month selling lamps at a hardware store near the Dominican capital\\u2019s Avenida Duarte shopping district, the donations meant a lot. \\u201CI felt a lot of happiness because I felt a lot of support from the people of the town, many prayers,\\u201D she said. \\u201CI had to understand that my life was not going to end with this.\\u201D By Sept. 30, police identified and arrested the alleged attackers \\u2014 Joan José Feliz, Pedro Alexander Sosa Méndez, and her ex-boyfriend and father to her 2-year-old daughter, Willy Antonio Javier Monegro. Together, the three men spent 15 days plotting the attack, according to court documents obtained by BuzzFeed News. According to the documents, Javier Monegro contacted Sosa Méndez in early September, offering to pay him approximately $431 to throw acid on Amarante Rodríguez. He allegedly agreed and received roughly $60 before the attack. Sosa Méndez then sought out Feliz as the third accomplice, according to court records. Javier Monegro told both men where Amarante Rodríguez worked and lived; he showed them a photograph they could use to recognize her, according to the records. WhatsApp messages that were included in the court documents show that the men kept in touch the days leading up to the attack. \\u201CDame bien la ora k eya sale,\\u201D Sosa Méndez texted Javier Monegro on Sept. 21. \\u201CTell me exactly what time she gets out.\\u201D \\u201CMete mano ya estoy De seperao,\\u201D he replied the next day. \\u201CHustle, I\\u2019m desperate.\\u201D \\u201CTrakilo eso va hoy,\\u201D Sosa Méndez responded. \\u201CDon\\u2019t worry, it\\u2019s going today.\\u201D \\u201CEn la misma cara en la frente,\\u201D Javier Monegro wrote. \\u201COn the face, the forehead.\\u201D On Sept. 25, Sosa Méndez and Feliz waited for Amarante Rodríguez to leave work, according to the court records. As she jumped into the passenger side of a Toyota Corolla, they followed her on a motorcycle. Sosa Méndez revved up the motorcycle, and Feliz threw the acid at her through an open window, according to court documents. The attack was captured on surveillance footage, helping the police identify and arrest the men purported to be involved in the attack. Javier Monegro was charged with criminal association, torture or act of barbarism, and intrafamily violence, according to the documents. In court, he chose to remain silent. The charges against Sosa Méndez and Feliz are criminal association, torture or act of barbarism, and voluntary blows and wounds. During criminal proceedings, the three men have denied their involvement in the attack. In an October hearing to decide if the men should be jailed for a year, Sosa Méndez said he wasn\\u2019t the person on video, adding that police told him that \\u201Cthey were going to make [him] talk with a bat.\\u201D In court, Feliz also alleged that police had tried to beat him into cooperating and insisted that the motorcycle involved in the attack is not his. The public defender representing Sosa Méndez and Feliz added, \\u201CThey interrogated them without their lawyers being present. The evidence presented by the public ministry is illegal because it was obtained in an illegitimate way.\\u201D A spokesperson for Dominican Republic National Police did not respond to a request for comment about the allegations made in court. The three men have been placed in jail for a year, where they\\u2019ll likely remain until the conclusion of the trial. On Feb. 19, 2021, a court ruled that the case would move forward, but it is unclear exactly when the trial will begin. In a phone call last month, Ronell Rosado, an attorney representing Javier Monegro, declined to comment on his client\\u2019s case. The lawyer listed as representing both Sosa Méndez and Feliz did not respond to an email requesting comment. By her own account, Amarante Rodríguez met Javier Monegro when she was 14 and he was 29. He worked at the factory in front of her grandmother\\u2019s house. One day, she asked him to give her a ride on his motorcycle. The two quickly became a couple, and she moved into his mother\\u2019s house that year.They stayed together for five years. When she was 16, she became pregnant and dropped out of school. Throughout their relationship, he repeatedly verbally and physically assaulted her, she said, adding that she had never told anyone about the alleged abuse. In a December interview with a forensic psychologist, a transcript of which was part of police records, she said he kept her trapped in his mother's house and forced her to cook and clean. He did not let her leave the house without him, she said. During fights, she said, he would push her, pull her hair, and call her derogatory names in vulgar Dominican slang that loosely translate to \\u201Cmotherfucker\\u201D and \\u201Ccocksucker.\\u201D When Javier Monegro allegedly tried to choke her in front of her sister, who intervened and tried to hit him with a bottle, Amarante Rodríguez told the forensic psychologist. He was remorseful after attacking her, she said during the interview. She accepted his apologies because she was in love with him. She said she ended the relationship in early 2020. Rosado, Javier Monegro\\u2019s lawyer, said his client never physically or verbally abused her. In an email to BuzzFeed News, the lawyer said there is no evidence to support her allegations, calling them \\\"only words and the accusation.\\\" \\\"The victim can say what she wants but there is nothing to prove it,\\\" Rosado said in an email. Marcia Aguiluz, managing attorney for Women\\u2019s Link Worldwide, a nonprofit aimed at ensuring gender equality, said the rise of domestic violence across Latin America and the Caribbean stems from the historical discrimination against women across the region and machismo \\u2014 the concept of exaggerated masculinity. In a Zoom interview from Costa Rica, Aguiluz said that cases of domestic violence in Latin America are not isolated incidents. \\u201CThey are a manifestation of that stereotype that women belong to men,\\u201D she said. According to court documents, Javier Monegro continued to harass her after their relationship ended, calling her as many as 44 times in one day. She subsequently blocked him on WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook. Two months after their breakup, Amarante Rodríguez started a relationship with her current boyfriend, something that made Javier Monegro feel bad, according to police records. His neighbors made negative comments about her being with another man, he told police. Two weeks before the attack, she said she ran into one of Javier Monegro\\u2019s friends, who told her to be careful because he was becoming increasingly aggressive. \\u201CI never thought he\\u2019d do this to me,\\u201D she said. The first time she saw her own face, she was at home. Acid attack survivors are not allowed to look at themselves in the mirror while in the hospital, her doctor said. She said her reflection stirred up suicidal thoughts, which she overcame by thinking about her daughter.Natalia Ponce de León, who survived an attack in 2014 in Colombia, said she wanted to die after a man doused her in sulfuric acid. She would go on to form the Natalia Ponce de León Foundation, which was instrumental in passing a law ensuring women in Colombia receive free medical and psychological care after an acid attack. Juan Manuel Santos, then the president of Colombia, signed the bill in 2016. A year later, Melania Trump, then the first lady, presented Ponce with the International Women of Courage Award in Washington, DC. Ponce told BuzzFeed News there is still more work to be done globally to support survivors. She wants more laws, like the one she helped create in her own country, to be implemented elsewhere. In the \\u201CDominican Republic [and] Mexico, there is no regulation. There is no law that protects victims of attacks with chemical agents,\\u201D Ponce said. \\u201CAnd this is a profound pain because it really should be strongly punished.\\u201D Survivors from the Dominican Republic have been turning to her charity for help, Ponce said, adding that many of them want to travel to Colombia to have their surgeries. \\u201CThey have to work for their rights \\u2014 every one of them, in their own country,\\u201D she said. On the day Amarante Rodríguez came home from the hospital, her family threw her a surprise party. Her daughter, Winny, who she hadn\\u2019t seen in months, didn\\u2019t recognize her. \\u201CWhen she saw me, the first thing she said to me was \\u2018Ahh! A cuco!\\u2019\\u201D a reference to a mythical monster, Amarante Rodríguez recalled. \\u201CI collapsed and began to cry.\\u201DShe is gearing up for more than 10 reconstructive surgeries. The burns continue to itch throughout the night. Her left eye is glazed over and doesn\\u2019t fully close. Though she\\u2019s hopeful, she knows she\\u2019ll never look like the woman in her Instagram pictures again. She is focused on taking care of her child and opening a salon with money Cardi B gifted her. After police arrested the men accused in the attack, Cardi B donated part of the reward money to her. Amarante Rodríguez still has not been able to personally thank the hip-hop star for her generosity. \\u201CI thank Cardi B very much,\\u201D she said, excitement filling her voice. Cardi B\\u2019s representatives did not respond to email requests for comment. Amarante Rodríguez recently ordered new signs for the salon that read: \\u201CYocairi Beauty Center.\\u201D She hopes to open later this year in the Villa Consuelo neighborhood of Santo Domingo. Though she\\u2019s uncertain about her future, she wants to finish high school someday and own a thriving business. The rest is in God\\u2019s hands, she said. Her daughter doesn\\u2019t know her mother\\u2019s story to the fullest extent, she said. She\\u2019s told Winny that she burned herself in a fire. If she someday finds out what happened, she said, it won\\u2019t be from her. Amarante Rodríguez is happy to be alive. She spends her days laughing with siblings and cousins. Her sense of humor hasn\\u2019t diminished. Her boyfriend hasn\\u2019t left her side. She implores younger women to stay in school and report boyfriends at the first sign of abuse. \\u201CDon\\u2019t stay silent,\\u201D she said. \\u201CFor staying silent and not reporting it \\u2014 this happened to me.\\u201D \\u2022"},{"author":"Tom Warren","title":"JPMorgan Staff Warned Of Nigeria Oil Deal \"Corruption\" Risk","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/tomwarren\/jpmorgan-corruption-risk-nigeria-oil-deal","content":"It looked like a major windfall for Nigeria's taxpayers, more than half of whom were living in \\u201Cabsolute poverty.\\u201D Two giant energy companies were offering more than $1 billion to drill oil on a strip of ocean just off the country\\u2019s coast. But there was a problem: Back in the 1990s, a corrupt regime had sold the drilling rights to a high-ranking minister who was also a convicted money launderer. So the spoils of this new deal were headed into his pockets.JPMorgan Chase had been asked to facilitate the 2011 payment, a fact that posed some challenges for the largest bank in the Western Hemisphere. \\u201CWe remain suspicious that these funds could be the proceeeds [sic] of corruption by public officials,\\u201D an anti\\u2013money laundering officer in London wrote in an email obtained by BuzzFeed News. Banks are supposed to be on guard for evidence of possible corruption, money laundering, or terrorism. When they spot it in a proposed transaction, they must alert law enforcement and decide whether to complete the payment. In an email to one of JPMorgan\\u2019s executive directors, the anti\\u2013money laundering officer outlined the bank\\u2019s options. First, he wrote, \\u201CWe could refuse to pay.\\u201D Alternatively, they could ask a court to decide what should be done. Or they could find a way to make the payment \\u2014 by sending it through the United Kingdom. That way it would encounter fewer obstacles than if it were routed through the US, where it was much likelier to be blocked, the anti\\u2013money laundering officer wrote. The payment was subjected to what one bank executive has described in court testimony as \\u201Csenior level scrutiny\\u201D from the bank\\u2019s lawyers and anti\\u2013money laundering officers. In the end, JPMorgan sent the money \\u2014 and used its UK branch to complete the deal, though it is not known whether other branches were used as well. Much of the money ended up with the corrupt ex-minister, who spent it on a private jet and big game hunting. JPMorgan earned an undisclosed sum in fees. The deal has since become an international scandal, leading to jail sentences for two of the middlemen involved. Executives from Shell and ENI, the energy firms that bought the oil rights, were acquitted on Wednesday of criminal corruption charges in an Italian criminal court. The current Nigerian government is suing JPMorgan in a UK court, arguing that \\u201Cno reasonable and honest banker\\u201D should have approved the payments.JPMorgan says that it took all the precautions it could. But documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News, including materials that form part of the FinCEN Files investigation, show that the banking giant sent the money despite multiple clear warning signs of corruption that its own staff unearthed and brought to the attention of high-level managers. After the first payments went through, JPMorgan\\u2019s financial crime staff in the US began a new investigation into one of the shell companies used in the suspected fraud. Those officers reported their suspicions to the US Treasury. And as the money began to move around the world, employees at other major banks reviewed related transactions \\u2014 and reported their own concerns about potential corruption to the US Treasury. Deutsche Bank even opened a \\u201Cspecial investigation\\u201D into the ex-minister\\u2019s finances in conjunction with law enforcement. Still, JPMorgan approved a final $75 million transaction to close out the deal. Months after that, a JPMorgan financial crime officer once again raised concerns about \\\"corruption risks\\\" linked to the company. In response to a detailed letter requesting comment, JPMorgan issued a statement through a spokesperson: \\u201CWe believe that we fully complied with our legal and regulatory obligations in this matter and that Nigeria\\u2019s on-going legal claim is completely without merit, so we will defend the claim robustly at trial.\\u201D In court, JPMorgan has argued that it received proper approvals for the transactions from Nigerian officials and had no responsibility to investigate the recipients of the money. The bank has presented a witness statement from one executive involved in the deal who said that having received instruction from Nigerian officials and permission from UK authorities, JPMorgan had no option but to proceed with the payment. \\u201CI do not believe that the Bank had any realistic alternative except to make a payment in accordance with its contractual obligations to its client,\\u201D the official said. Before the Italian court verdict, both Shell and ENI told BuzzFeed News that they continued to believe that the transactions were legal. Shell and ENI issued statements on Wednesday welcoming the acquittals. \\\"We have always maintained that the 2011 settlement was legal,\\\" a Shell spokesperson said. \\\"At the same time, this has been a difficult learning experience for us. Shell is a company that operates with integrity and we work hard every day to ensure our actions not only follow the letter and spirit of the law, but also live up to society\\u2019s wider expectations of us.\\\" Since last fall the FinCEN Files, an investigation based on thousands of government documents that BuzzFeed News shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, has shown how big banks around the world approve trillions of dollars of suspicious transactions despite their own staffs\\u2019 warnings that they might be related to crime. The investigation led UK lawmakers to launch a formal inquiry into their government\\u2019s oversight of banks and money laundering. British companies were named in FinCEN Files suspicious activity reports more than 3,000 times, more than those from any other country. In a secret US Treasury report, American officials described the UK as a \\u201Chigher-risk jurisdiction,\\u201D comparing it to notorious money laundering hubs \\u201Csuch as Cyprus.\\u201D The JPMorgan anti\\u2013money laundering officer\\u2019s email raises further questions \\u2014 about why a suspicious billion-dollar payment would face fewer obstacles if it were made through the UK instead of the US. JPMorgan is one of American finance\\u2019s most storied institutions. Its founder, John Pierpont Morgan, helped usher in the Gilded Age in the late 19th century. Its current CEO, Jamie Dimon, is one of Wall Street\\u2019s most famous executives. The bank is worth more than $470 billion and manages more than $2.5 trillion. Nigeria has Africa\\u2019s largest economy, driven by the country\\u2019s vast oil and gas reserves. But government corruption has long kept that wealth out of the hands of its citizens, millions of whom live in poverty. One former official for both the government and the World Bank estimated that more than $400 billion in oil revenue had been stolen or mismanaged since Nigeria\\u2019s independence in 1960. The problem was especially fierce during the military dictatorship of Sani Abacha in the 1990s. He is believed to have embezzled $5 billion from the country during his five years in office.Dan Etete served as Abacha\\u2019s petroleum minister. In 1998, Etete\\u2019s ministry awarded control of a deep sea oil reserve to a company called Malabu. The company\\u2019s owner was none other than Etete himself. That same year, Abacha died, and Nigeria began a transition to democracy. The new government claimed that Etete had stolen the oil rights for his personal gain, but after a series of legal skirmishes, he managed to retain control. In 2007, a court in France convicted Etete of using a pseudonym to open a Swiss bank account and funnel illicit cash into French real estate. In 2009, his conviction was upheld. A BuzzFeed News investigation found that Shell\\u2019s top executives knew the money would go to Etete but signed off on the purchase anyway. But for the deal to go through, the energy companies had to find banks willing to send the money. Shell had not wanted to deal with Etete directly due to the corruption risk, so a deal was agreed where the cash would be paid to the government of Nigeria, which would in turn forward it to Etete. As Nigeria was already a JPMorgan client, the bank agreed to act as escrow for the deal. It set up an account that would receive Shell and ENI\\u2019s money, and then send it to the final recipient. In May 2011, JPMorgan tried to deposit the first tranche of funds into an account in Switzerland. But the Swiss bank, worried that the funds were linked to corruption, blocked the payment.That\\u2019s what led JPMorgan financial crime staffers to look at the deal in detail, according to court records. One wrote that he thought there were red flags. For example, the document claiming to be Nigeria\\u2019s official approval for the deal was faxed from a Hilton hotel rather than a government office. \\u201C[T]he communications reflect a strong sense of urgency,\\u201D he wrote, asking, \\u201Cwas the rationale for that understood?\\u201D JPMorgan has argued in court the Hilton fax was \\u201Cnot unusual or suspicious.\\u201D Inside JPMorgan\\u2019s London office, the anti\\u2013money laundering officer assessed the situation. He wrote in an email that he had been thinking about the deal overnight and had instructed a colleague to file what is known as a suspicious activity report to the UK\\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency. Over the course of nine of those reports, first reported by Finance Uncovered, JPMorgan noted Etete's money laundering conviction, expressed concerns that Etete was the owner of Malabu, and pointed out that the transaction had been rejected by the other banks. JPMorgan asked for permission to go ahead with the deal despite these concerns. While the bank awaited a response, the anti\\u2013money laundering officer followed up with his email warning colleagues that \\u201Cthese funds could be the proceeeds [sic] of corruption by public officials.\\u201D The version of the email obtained by BuzzFeed News was originally provided to Italian prosecutors who are investigating Shell and ENI. The bank redacted some passages, claiming legal privilege, a claim on which Britain\\u2019s Serious Fraud Office said it has \\u201Cyet to decide.\\u201D \\u201CJPMorgan needs to be comfortable that it is taking the appropriate steps,\\u201D the anti\\u2013money laundering officer wrote. In addition to simply refusing to make the payment or asking courts for help, the anti\\u2013money laundering officer also suggested going to Nigeria\\u2019s attorney general or, \\u201Cgiven the size and sensitivity of the payment, perhaps even the president himself.\\u201DThe anti\\u2013money laundering officer\\u2019s own JPMorgan colleagues in the US would likely block the transaction, he wrote. The UK was a better bet. \\u201CClearly, it would not seem at odds to make a payment from the UK,\\u201D he wrote, \\u201Cwhich JPMorgan in the US would reject based on the same fact pattern.\\u201D He did not say why. He also asked to \\u201Creview the legal risks if we went ahead with the paayment [sic] in the given circumstances.\\u201D It is not known what legal advice the bank received. The anti\\u2013money laundering officer did not respond to requests for comment. The Serious Organised Crime Agency eventually wrote JPMorgan that it \\u201Cconsents to you proceeding.\\u201D The agency warned that JPMorgan still had a responsibility to perform its own due diligence and make its own decision. The Serious Organised Crime Agency has since closed. Its successor, the National Crime Agency, told BuzzFeed News it could \\u201Cneither confirm nor deny\\u201D what happened but noted that under the law at the time, it could only refuse consent for a transaction if there was a \\u201Crealistic proposition of positive law enforcement action\\u201D within 31 days.It is not clear exactly who inside JPMorgan made the final decision, and JPMorgan declined to identify the person in its response to BuzzFeed News. Bank staffers have said in witness statements that the payment \\u201Cwas the subject of senior level scrutiny\\u201D and that the bank consulted lawyers from high-powered law firm Clifford Chance about the legality of the transaction. Clifford Chance declined to comment. The bank made the first payment in August 2011. By November the bank\\u2019s US division was already investigating it. One US financial crime officer warned in an email that \\u201CJPMC identified possible concerns with foreign corruption,\\u201D though she had not yet confirmed the wrongdoing. Around the same time, the US Department of Justice opened a probe. Other banks began tracing the money and reporting what they saw to the US Treasury via suspicious activity reports. A month after the funds arrived, Etete moved much of the cash from Malabu to Rocky Top Resources, another company whose finances have come under extensive scrutiny. In 2012 Standard Chartered found that Rocky Top had sent $17 million to a company called Gunes General Trading, which appeared to be laundering money in the United Arab Emirates. It later emerged that Gunes is controlled by Reza Zarrab, who was arrested by the US in 2016 for operating a Middle Eastern money laundering organization. The next year Deutsche Bank uncovered $271 million in suspicious transactions linked to Rocky Top, including direct payments to Etete that went toward an armored car, hunting trips in South Africa, and a 17-seat Bombardier 6000 jet that authorities later seized. In July 2013, after a Nigerian anti-corruption agency said Etete had used Rocky Top to launder the proceeds of the Malabu deal, JPMorgan reported its own suspicions about the company to the US government, the FinCEN Files show. The full contents of that suspicious activity report are unknown, but a later filing shows that it was related to a British energy firm\\u2019s $10 million payment to Rocky Top. JPMorgan did not respond to questions about the Rocky Top payment. JPMorgan\\u2019s investigation into Etete\\u2019s relationship with the bank was still ongoing at this time, and one of the financial crime officers involved recommended adding Etete to an internal watchlist of people whose every transaction had to be specially approved by anti\\u2013money laundering officers.The bank followed that advice \\u2014 but not until after it transferred the final $75 million payment from the Shell deal, in August 2013, court records show. In court JPMorgan has argued that the timing was irrelevant to the transaction, which bank financial crime officers were already scrutinizing. Around this time, JPMorgan wrote to a different client, Arcadia Petroleum, to inquire why despite \\u201Ccorruption risks\\u201D it had paid Rocky Top $10 million, according to documents shared with BuzzFeed News by Finance Uncovered. Arcadia assured the bank that the companies \\u201Cdo not have a business relationship\\u201D and that the transactions were merely repaying expenses. However, it was later reported that the Arcadia CEO advised Etete on the oil rights deal. Arcadia Energy did not respond to a request for comment; it has previously denied any wrongdoing. Nigeria\\u2019s lawsuit against JPMorgan is still pending in UK courts. The trial is due to take place next year. Etete remains unrepentant. He owns a series of luxury villas in Dubai, including a mansion in \\u201CEmirates Hills,\\u201D a gated community amid artificial lakes and an 18-hole championship golf course named after Beverly Hills. In a rare interview last year, Etete described the allegations against him as \\u201Cpolitical propaganda.\\u201D ●"}]
